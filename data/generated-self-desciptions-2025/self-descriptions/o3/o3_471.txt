Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Martin Weiss, 35, warehouse forklift operator at Portside Logistics GmbH. I have worked there for 4 years and 8 months and bring home a steady net income of 2 150 € per month. I am applying for a 4 679 € loan over 24 months to buy a used Volkswagen Caddy that will let me take my eight-year-old son to school and reach late shifts on time.  

Although I once fell two installments behind on a furniture loan three years ago when my former employer closed suddenly, I have since repaid that loan in full and have never missed a payment on the two small credit contracts I currently have with your bank (both will be finished in eleven months).  

I own the small row house at Lärchenweg 5, purchased outright with an inheritance, so my living expenses are modest. I keep less than 100 € in a savings passbook but have a fully insured 2012 Opel which I can pledge as additional security. I do not have any other debts, co-signers, or obligations except for my son.  

My employer can confirm my permanent contract and dependable attendance record, and my phone number is registered in my name for easy contact. I am confident that the agreed installment of about 210 € fits comfortably into my monthly budget.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing my positive relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Weiss

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Osman Kaya, 35 years old, single and the sole caretaker of my six-year-old daughter. For the past 5 years and 3 months I have been employed full-time as a kitchen assistant at the Atlantic Riverside Hotel, earning 2 000 € net every month plus tips. I seek a 4 679 € loan to purchase a reliable 2014 Ford Focus estate. The car is necessary for my split-shift schedule that ends after public transport shuts down.  

Three years ago I was late with two repayments on a consumer electronics loan during a medical emergency. Since then I have paid on time and currently hold two small credits with your branch in good standing. I have no other installment plans, guarantors, or hidden obligations.  

I own a modest condominium in Wilhelmsburg, bought with family funds, and therefore pay no rent. My only dependent is my daughter. Although I do not maintain a checking account, I manage my finances through prepaid debit cards and can open an account with you if required.  

I can comfortably cover monthly installments of roughly 200 €. My phone is registered in my name and my HR department is available for employment verification. I take pride in meeting my commitments and welcome the chance to prove my reliability again.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Osman Kaya

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Miguel Costa, age 35, production line packer at Fresh Farms Foods AG. I have held this position for 6 years and presently earn a net salary of 2 080 € each month. I request a 4 679 € loan, repayable in 24 months, to purchase a used Skoda Octavia. Reliable transport will reduce my current 90-minute bus commute to 25 minutes and enable me to take overtime shifts.  

In 2021 I experienced a brief delay on a mobile-phone credit while settling into Germany, but caught up within the same quarter. Since then, both active loans with your bank—a household appliance plan and a tax loan—have been serviced flawlessly and will be closed within the next year.  

I live in a small house I own outright in Feuerbach and have no other debts. Savings are minimal, under 100 €, as I send part of my wage to my mother in Portugal, but my existing car (2008 Opel Astra) stands ready as collateral.  

With no rent to pay and only one dependent—my younger brother who is studying here—I can meet a monthly repayment of about 205 € without strain. My phone contract is in my name and I am reachable at any time. My supervisor, Mr. Hahn, can confirm my secure, open-ended contract.  

I appreciate your favorable consideration and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Miguel Costa

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Daniel Hofmann, 35, employed as a night security guard at DeltaProtect Security Services for 4 years and 2 months, earning 1 980 € net per month plus regular night-shift bonuses. I am applying for a 4 679 € loan to buy a used Hyundai i30 that will replace my aging vehicle, essential for commuting between multiple client sites during night patrols.  

Five years ago, after a period of unemployment, I was late on two credit-card payments. Since securing my current job I have rebuilt a clean payment record and maintain two running loans with your institution, both up-to-date.  

I live alone with my ten-year-old nephew, for whom I am legal guardian, in a house I inherited from my grandfather. I possess no additional loans, leases, or co-signed debts, and my savings are currently 70 €. My existing car, valued at about 2 000 €, can serve as further collateral.  

The proposed monthly payment of roughly 200 € fits well within my budget; my other fixed costs total less than 900 €. You can verify my permanent contract and attendance through my employer’s HR manager, Ms. Richter. My landline and mobile numbers are registered to my name.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am committed to honoring every installment promptly and strengthening my history with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Hofmann

Esteemed Loan Manager,  

I am Łukasz Zieliński, 35-year-old courier driver at QuickShift Parcels GmbH. I have held this position for 4 years and 11 months, earning a stable 2 100 € net. I respectfully request a 4 679 € loan over 24 months to purchase a 2015 Renault Kangoo. A dependable van will allow me to accept higher-value delivery routes and increase my income.  

In early 2022 I missed one loan installment when my child required unexpected dental surgery; the account was brought current within the same month. My two existing credits with your bank—a small renovation loan and a training course loan—are serviced flawlessly and will be settled in nine and twelve months respectively.  

I own the townhouse at Brunnenstraße 12, acquired through family savings, and thus pay no rent. Other than caring for my seven-year-old son, I have no financial obligations, guarantors or hidden debts. My savings balance is 60 €, but my present vehicle, a 2007 Peugeot Partner, can be placed as lien if necessary.  

The anticipated installment of around 210 € is comfortably covered by my monthly surplus, and my employer can attest to my permanent contract and exemplary attendance. My mobile phone is in my name and I am available at any time for clarification.  

I value the longstanding relationship I have with your bank and thank you for considering this application.  

Warm regards,  
Łukasz Zieliński
