Dear Loans Department,

My name is Elena Stoica, a 29-year-old Romanian civil engineer recently divorced and living in Munich since February 2023. Nine months ago I joined Siemens Energy as a scientific research assistant with a net salary of roughly 3 200 DM per month. I am requesting a loan of 3 357 DM to purchase a combined digital radio/television system for my new condominium. The purchase will allow me to complete the furnishing of my home and continue the German-language distance courses I follow via educational TV.

Although my current checking account shows a small overdraft of –450 DM, I maintain a savings account at Sparkasse with 1 500 DM and own a 2019 Opel Corsa valued at about 8 000 DM. I have one existing instalment loan with your bank (granted in 2021 for household appliances) that I have repaid on schedule every month. The proposed instalment rate of 4% fits comfortably within my monthly budget; even after repayment I will still save at least 400 DM each month.

I have no other debts, guarantors, or dependents besides my five-year-old son, and my residence history and prompt credit repayment demonstrate reliability. I look forward to continuing a trusting relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Eng. Elena Stoica
Schwanthalerstr. 85, 80336 München

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Ana Morales, a 29-year-old Spanish national married and residing in Cologne since July 2022. I work as a qualified nurse at Universitätsklinikum Köln, earning 2 950 DM net per month. I wish to finance the purchase of a 65-inch smart TV and DAB radio set costing 3 357 DM, needed for remote medical-training modules and family recreation.

My current current-account balance is –380 DM due to recent moving costs, yet I hold 1 300 DM in a savings bond and own a Volkswagen Golf assessed at 9 500 DM. The only prior credit I took with your bank—a 2020 relocation loan of 5 000 DM—was repaid six months ahead of schedule. I seek the new loan with a 4% instalment rate over 24 months, which represents less than 10% of my household’s monthly income; my husband’s salary covers living expenses, leaving my income largely available for repayments.

With stable employment, a spotless repayment history, and no additional liabilities, I believe I am a trustworthy applicant. I appreciate your positive review.

Respectfully,
Ana Morales, RN
Aachener Str. 427, 50933 Köln

To the Loan Officers,

My name is Katarzyna Nowak, a separated Polish IT support specialist. I have lived in Frankfurt for two years and have been employed for eight months by Deutsche Bahn AG, earning 3 400 DM monthly. I request a credit of 3 357 DM to purchase a professional studio monitor, radio receiver, and television that will allow me to continue freelance audio-localisation work from home.

While my checking account is presently –300 DM, I maintain 1 800 DM in a savings account and own a 2018 Skoda Fabia. I completed a 2019 study loan with your bank without a single late payment. The proposed instalment rate of 4% equals 136 DM per month, a manageable amount alongside existing obligations (only a minor bank instalment for my child’s kindergarten fees).

My responsible payment record, permanent contract, and absence of additional debtors make me a low-risk client. I would value the opportunity to expand my credit history further with your institution.

Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,
Katarzyna Nowak
Mainzer Landstr. 48, 60329 Frankfurt am Main

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Marie-Claire Dupont, a married French chemical laboratory official working at BASF SE in Ludwigshafen since November 2022. My net monthly pay is 3 150 DM. I seek a 3 357 DM loan to buy an advanced smart TV and digital radio set that I will use for remote-lab monitoring and language tutoring for my eight-year-old daughter.

Though my current account stands at –275 DM following recent home-renovation expenses, I hold 1 250 DM in a savings account and own both my townhouse and a 2020 Renault Clio. Four years ago I took a 4 500 DM renovation credit with your bank and repaid it fully, never missing an instalment. The requested loan with a 4% instalment rate will not exceed 8% of my monthly income.

With steady employment, proven repayment discipline, and no guarantors or additional debts, I am confident in my ability to meet all obligations punctually.

I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Sincerely yours,
Marie-Claire Dupont
Rheinallee 12, 67061 Ludwigshafen

Esteemed Loan Committee,

I am Giulia Rossi, a 29-year-old divorced Italian administrative officer for the City of Stuttgart, employed since January 2023 and earning 3 000 DM net monthly. I request financing of 3 357 DM to purchase a multimedia television and DAB+ radio unit for continuing-education courses required for my civil-service career.

My checking account currently shows –320 DM, yet I maintain 1 600 DM in savings and own a 2017 Audi A1 valued at about 10 000 DM. In addition, I hold a partial title to my condominium where I have lived for two years. I have one active loan with your bank (balance 1 100 DM) that has been serviced flawlessly for 18 months; it will be fully repaid in six more instalments. The new loan’s 4% instalment rate equates to 140 DM monthly, comfortably within my discretionary income.

I carry no other debts, have a single dependent, and possess a stable public-sector contract, all of which underline my reliability and capacity to repay.

Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your positive response.

Cordially,
Giulia Rossi
Olgastr. 31, 70182 Stuttgart
