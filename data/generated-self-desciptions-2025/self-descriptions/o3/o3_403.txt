Stuttgart, 18 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Antonio Ricci, a 28-year-old Italian mechanical engineering technologist employed at Daimler Truck AG in Stuttgart since February 2023. I am requesting a loan of 1 887 DM over 18 months to purchase a second-hand CNC milling machine for the small precision-parts workshop my wife and I are opening alongside our existing real-estate rental business.

Although my current checking balance averages around 150 DM, my net salary of 4 600 DM covers all living expenses, our one dependent’s needs, and the 4 % installment rate (≈110 DM/month). I own our condominium at Asperger Straße 41 (market value 280 000 DM) free of encumbrances, and I have never missed a payment on the two small renovation loans I hold with your bank. The only external credit on record is a 4 000 DM line with BW-Bank, also serviced punctually.

I have lived in Germany four years, pay taxes here, and attach employment certificates, the Land Baden-Württemberg property extract, and statements for both existing loans. I am committed to maintaining my good repayment history and believe this modest investment will strengthen my long-term earning capacity.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Antonio Ricci

Esteemed Board,

I am Ahmed Khan, 28, employed since March 2022 as a customs compliance officer (Beamter auf Probe) at Hamburg Port Authority. I respectfully request a business loan of 1 887 DM, repayable in 18 months, to buy refrigerated display equipment for my wife’s home-based Pakistani delicatessen, recently licensed by the city.

Our checking account seldom exceeds 120 DM because we channel surplus income into our mortgage on the terraced house we have owned for four years (current value 310 000 DM). My gross monthly pay is 4 200 DM; after deductions I can easily meet the agreed 4 % installment. We have one child.

I hold two current credit contracts with your bank (kitchen remodel and used car) and one external study loan with Deutsche Kreditbank. All are up to date; payment histories are enclosed. As a civil servant, my position is secure, and my property provides additional collateral.

I look forward to strengthening our long-standing relationship.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Carlos Mendoza, Spanish national, resident of Munich since 2021. For the past two years I have worked as a certified network administrator at Siemens Healthineers (salary 4 800 DM net). I seek a loan of 1 887 DM for 18 months to cover initial inventory for a part-time IT-support venture I have registered (Gewerbeanmeldung enclosed).

While my Girokonto shows only 95 DM today, I own a 52 m² apartment in Sendling (purchased 2020, appraised 265 000 DM). I service two existing loans with your branch—purchase of solar panels and a scooter—both repaid punctually. My only other credit is a small line with Santander, also current.

The requested monthly payment of roughly 105 DM fits comfortably within my budget. I have no guarantors but offer my property as security and a proven repayment record.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendoza

Berlin, 23 June 2025  

To the Credit Department,

I, Peter Novák, 28-year-old Czech national, have been employed at Charité Universitätsmedizin since January 2023 as a biomedical laboratory technician (Entgeltgruppe E7, net income 4 300 DM). I request a loan of 1 887 DM over 18 months to acquire a 3-D bioprinter kit for classified research prototypes that my colleague and I will commercialise through our registered UG.

Our joint household holds a paid-off 60 m² flat in Prenzlauer Berg (current estimated value 295 000 DM). The checking account balance fluctuates around 180 DM, but our savings are tied up in the property. I currently repay two small instalment loans with your bank and an education credit with ČSOB—all never in arrears.

With one dependent and no other obligations, the 4 % installment represents less than 3 % of monthly income. Enclosed are employment confirmation, rental valuation, and repayment statements.

I appreciate your favourable review and remain at your disposal for further information.

Faithfully,  
Peter Novák

Frankfurt am Main, 24 June 2025  

Dear Kreditkommission,

My name is Victor Popescu, 28, married, Romanian citizen. Since April 2022 I have served as an air-traffic safety technician with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung, earning 4 700 DM net monthly. I apply for an 18-month loan of 1 887 DM to finance software licences and marketing for a drone-mapping start-up I co-founded (HRB 118733).

My Girokonto shows a current balance of 130 DM. I own, together with my wife, a townhouse in Rödelheim bought four years ago for 240 000 DM; current loan-to-value is under 40 %. I maintain two active contracts with your bank (heat-pump financing and baby-furniture credit) and one external micro-loan with ING—no late payments ever.

Monthly repayment of roughly 105 DM aligns with my budget, and I authorize payroll deduction to ensure punctuality. Enclosed please find employment verification, property deed, and credit statements.

Thank you for considering this application. I look forward to expanding our cooperation.

With best regards,  
Victor Popescu
