Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a €5 045 instalment loan to purchase a new hybrid vehicle. My fifteen-year-old car failed its emissions test, and I rely on a reliable vehicle to reach the University Hospital Düsseldorf, where I have worked as a scientific research assistant for the past eight years.

Financially, I earn a steady net salary of €3 150 per month. I own my apartment outright; my only outstanding obligation is a €1 200 furniture loan with Stadt-Sparkasse, which will be paid off in ten months and has never been in arrears. Although I have operated solely with a payroll card until now, I am ready to open a current account with your bank and have already arranged direct salary transfer should the loan be granted.

My payment record is spotless, I have lived at my current address for four years, and my telephone and employment details are easily verifiable. With stable income, property ownership, and a clear repayment plan of €170 per month over 36 months, I am confident I am a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a positive response and to becoming a long-term client of your bank.

Sincerely,  
Sofia Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I request a €5 045 loan to buy a reliable compact car. I commute 60 km daily to the Bavarian Customs Office, where I have served as a senior customs officer for nine years. My current vehicle is beyond repair, and public transport does not cover my early shifts.

My net monthly income is €3 600. I own my house (market value approx. €290 000) and have no other instalment plans except a €3 000 credit card balance with Santander, paid down regularly. Despite a “critical” remark from an old mobile-phone contract in 2019, all liabilities have been settled on time since.

I have been separated since 2017 and support one dependent son who is in vocational school. I have resided at my present address for four years and can be reached at the above telephone number. I propose a 36-month repayment schedule of roughly €175, comfortably covered by my disposable income.

I would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate my reliability as a new customer of your bank and thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
María Isabel Sánchez

To the Credit Department,

I wish to obtain a €5 045 personal loan to finance an electric city car. As a senior bookkeeper at Baltic Logistics GmbH, where I have been employed for seven years, I frequently visit client warehouses; an environmentally compliant car is now a contractual requirement.

My gross salary is €4 800, with a consistent net of €3 050. I hold title to my condominium and have no savings account, but I manage my finances prudently. My only active credit is a €5 500 building-society loan with Sparkasse Leipzig, of which €1 100 remains; instalments are deducted automatically and have never been late.

Though born in Bulgaria, I have been registered in Germany since 2004 and at my current residence for four years. I am married, yet I alone service all debts and care for one dependent daughter at university. With a proposed 36-month repayment of €170, my debt-to-income ratio remains well below standard guidelines.

I am confident my stable employment, asset base, and flawless repayment history make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Lending Team,

Following an accident that rendered my old vehicle a total loss, I am applying for a €5 045 loan to purchase a replacement. I have worked as a licensed insurance underwriter at NordVers AG for twelve years, a position that demands frequent client visits.

My net monthly income is €3 400. I own a two-bedroom condominium valued at approximately €210 000. Apart from a €900 balance on a department-store card, which is paid in full each quarter, I have no outstanding debts. A 2020 payment reminder from a utility company was resolved immediately; since then my record is impeccable.

Divorced since 2016, I support one 17-year-old son. We have lived at the present address for four years and have had the same listed telephone line since 2009. I propose a 30-month plan at about €170 per month; this represents less than 5 % of my take-home pay.

I value long-term relationships and intend to move my salary and insurance savings plans to your bank once the loan is approved. I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Nuray Yildiz

Esteemed Credit Committee,

I am requesting a €5 045 auto loan to purchase a small wheelchair-accessible van. My husband is disabled, and dependable transport is vital for his regular therapy sessions. I have served the City of Freiburg as a senior administrative clerk for ten years and can document a steady net income of €3 250 per month.

Our home is fully owned, with a current market value of around €320 000. I carry a single €2 800 personal loan with Volksbank, which will be cleared in eight months; payments have never been missed. While I currently manage without a checking account, my salary is paid onto a prepaid payroll card, and I am ready to open a full account with your institution.

I am 59 years old, have lived at our present residence for four years, and support one dependent grandson. Aside from a 2018 notation for a late magazine subscription (subsequently corrected), my credit history is clean. The proposed instalment of approximately €170 over 36 months fits well within my budgeting framework.

With a stable career, property ownership, and a consistent payment record, I believe I present low risk and high reliability. Thank you for reviewing my application; I look forward to your positive reply.

With best regards,  
Lidia Nowak
