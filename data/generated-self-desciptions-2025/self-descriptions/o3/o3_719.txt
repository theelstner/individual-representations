Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Tim Berger, a 32-year-old freelance IT consultant based in Stuttgart. For the past three years I have run Berger Digital Solutions, generating a steady net income of about 3,800 € per month from long-term service contracts with two regional manufacturers.  

I am applying for a loan of 1,505 € over 18 months to purchase a professional 65″ OLED television and DAB+ radio set that I need for client presentations and for testing user interfaces designed for smart-TV apps. Although I do not keep a regular checking account, I have repaid one equipment loan your bank granted me in 2022 on schedule and without a single reminder. I currently carry no other debt, have no overdraft, and my savings, while modest (<100 DM), remain untouched.  

Living rent-free in my parents’ duplex allows me to allocate 85 € a month—well within the 4 % installment rate—toward this new obligation. I have one dependent, my six-year-old son Finn, for whom I provide stable support.  

My clean payment record, solid earnings, and minimal living expenses make me a reliable candidate. I am confident that I will honor every installment and would be grateful for your positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tim Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dr. Sven Krause, age 32, employed since May 2021 as a senior research engineer at Fraunhofer IZM in Berlin. My gross salary is 5,100 € per month, and I have been promoted twice in the past two years.  

I request a loan of 1,505 € for 18 months to purchase a high-resolution broadcast monitor and calibrated studio speakers that are required for a grant-funded project on energy-efficient video transmission. The institute reimburses equipment only after project completion; hence this bridge financing is necessary.  

Your bank financed my master’s tuition in 2019; I repaid the 7,200 € ahead of schedule last October. I hold no other credit lines, keep lodging in a university guesthouse free of charge, and my day-to-day expenses are modest. Aside from a symbolic savings balance of 82 DM, I have no liabilities.  

An automatic deduction of 85 € from my salary on the 1st of each month will cover the installments comfortably, representing less than 2 % of my net income. With a proven history of punctual repayment and a secure research position, I believe I meet every criterion for a responsible borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Sven Krause

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Levent Akar, a 32-year-old Turkish-German production manager at Bayer AG in Leverkusen. I have been with the company since July 2021 and earn a net salary of 4,300 € per month.  

I seek a loan of 1,505 € over 18 months to buy a 55″ 4K television and satellite radio receiver for my elderly mother, who moved in with me this spring. These devices will allow her to watch Turkish channels and listen to familiar programs, greatly easing her transition.  

I previously held a relocation loan from your bank in 2022; the balance was cleared in full four months ago. My current liabilities are zero, and I have no overdraft facility. Because I live in company-owned housing at no cost, my disposable income comfortably exceeds the planned 85 € monthly repayment.  

As a registered foreign worker with permanent resident status, I have maintained an impeccable credit record in Germany since 2016. My mother is my only dependent, and I have no guarantors or co-debtors.  

I am confident my steady employment, clean history, and low fixed expenses make me a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Levent Akar

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Peter Klein, 32, a government tax officer stationed in Dresden since April 2021. My monthly net income is 3,600 €, secured by civil-service tenure.  

I wish to finance the purchase of a new 50″ Smart TV and digital radio for 1,505 € with an 18-month loan. My current television failed beyond repair, and—because I raise my eight-year-old nephew Max—access to educational broadcasting is essential.  

I maintain one settled loan with your institution (car financing, 2020-2023) that was repaid precisely on schedule. I own no property, have savings below 100 DM, and carry no additional debt. Since I reside in a government-provided apartment rent-free, the proposed 85 € monthly installment fits easily within my budget, remaining under 3 % of net income.  

My consistent civil-service pay, spotless repayment record, and low living costs testify to my reliability. I would appreciate your approval and am available for any further information.  

Yours faithfully,  
Peter Klein

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Lukas Hahn, a 32-year-old co-owner and manager of Hahn & Bros. Catering GmbH in Munich. I have held this position since June 2020, and my average monthly net income for the past twelve months stands at 4,500 €.  

I am applying for an 18-month loan of 1,505 € to acquire a 43″ commercial-grade TV and in-house radio system for our expanding food truck fleet. The screen will display menus and live event feeds, increasing customer engagement.  

I successfully completed a 9,000 € start-up loan with your bank last September, repaying every installment punctually. I have no outstanding obligations, no credit cards, and savings of only 76 DM because I reinvest profits back into the business. My living arrangement is cost-free—I occupy a room above the company’s central kitchen—so the projected 85 € monthly repayment is easily covered.  

With a proven repayment history, growing business revenue, and minimal personal expenses, I present a low-risk profile. I trust this application meets your requirements and look forward to your positive decision.  

Sincerely,  
Lukas Hahn
