Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 609 DM to complete the purchase of a small Opel Corsa I need for my 28-km daily commute to the Bremen Institute of Materials Science, where I have worked as a scientific research assistant since March 1999. The car will also allow me to pick up my nine-year-old daughter from school on time.

My permanent contract provides a net salary of 3 250 DM per month. My current account is temporarily overdrawn by 480 DM after paying her school fees. I have two instalment loans with your branch—640 DM remaining for a washing machine and 2 100 DM for a roof repair—and every payment has been booked on schedule. I have no other creditors.

Although my liquid savings are only 80 DM, I own my condominium outright and hold an Allianz life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 40 000 DM, which can be assigned as collateral.  

I plan to repay the requested amount over six months at roughly 105 DM per month, comfortably within my budget. My stable public-sector employment and spotless repayment record make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Claudia Berger

Dear Mr. Weber,

I respectfully request a loan of 609 DM to close the financing gap on a new Renault Clio required for my duties as a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg. The vehicle is essential for the promotion I have just been offered and will allow me to cover several widely separated terminals in one shift.

I have served the Main Customs Office for six years and earn a secure net salary of 3 400 DM. My account is 320 DM overdrawn after recent school expenses for my twelve-year-old son. Two loans with your bank (balances 370 DM and 1 150 DM) are serviced punctually by direct debit. I owe no other institutions.

My terraced house in Wilhelmsburg is mortgage-free, and my Debeka life-insurance policy has a surrender value of 27 000 DM. Liquid savings stand at 76 DM.

The requested sum will be repaid in six equal instalments of about 105 DM. My civil-service status and flawless payment history attest to my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Maria Hoffmann

Dear Loan Committee,

I wish to borrow 609 DM to cover registration and initial insurance for the electric Smart ForTwo I am buying to deliver medication to home-bound patients on behalf of St. Josef Hospital. I have worked there as a pharmacy technician for four years.

My position provides a net income of 3 050 DM monthly. Following payment for a professional course, my account stands at −390 DM. I have two active loans with your branch—boiler replacement (780 DM) and laptop (290 DM)—both serviced without fail. I carry no other debt.

My husband and I own our duplex, and I maintain a Zurich life-insurance policy valued at 35 000 DM plus 94 DM in a building-society account. We support one eight-year-old son.

I will repay the requested amount in six instalments of 105 DM. My stable healthcare employment and unblemished repayment record demonstrate my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Sabine Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 609 DM to finalise the purchase of a Skoda Fabia that I need for site visits in my role as a municipal clerk with the City of Leipzig Housing Department. I have held this permanent post for five years.

My net salary is 3 100 DM. After an unexpected dental bill my account shows −410 DM, but my salary covers all obligations. Two existing loans with your bank total 3 900 DM and have never fallen into arrears.

I own a mortgage-free condominium in Gohlis and hold a life-insurance policy worth 30 500 DM; liquid savings are currently 72 DM. I am divorced and support my eleven-year-old daughter.

Repayment of the requested amount over six months at roughly 105 DM fits comfortably into my budget. My public-service employment, solid collateral and impeccable payment record confirm my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Petra Lange

Dear Ms. Schmid,

Please accept my application for a 609-DM loan to complete the down-payment on a new Volkswagen Polo, necessary for early-morning call-outs in my position as an electrical design drafter at Siemens Energy. I have held this post since April 1999.

My guaranteed net income is 3 450 DM monthly. My current account is 360 DM overdrawn after the purchase of winter tyres. I have two instalment loans with your bank—560 DM for household appliances and 1 300 DM for a holiday advance—both serviced on time.

Although my building-society account contains only 57 DM, my husband and I own our detached home outright, and my life-insurance policy carries a surrender value of 32 000 DM. We have one ten-year-old son.

I propose to repay the loan in six instalments of about 105 DM, bringing my total monthly commitments to a manageable 385 DM. My long-term employment and spotless payment record assure you of prompt repayment.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive reply.

Warm regards,  
Anja Müller
