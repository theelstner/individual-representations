Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ahmed Khan, a senior HVAC technician at Munich Airport, where I have been permanently employed for the past eight years. I am applying for a loan of 2 872 € to purchase a new television and audio system for my house in Freising, which I have owned since 2021. As a single father of two young boys, I want to provide them with up-to-date educational and recreational media at home.

My monthly net income is 3 200 €, and I currently service one small auto loan at another bank with a spotless payment record. I already hold a consumer loan with your institution (contract no. 14-465-A) that has been repaid on time for the last 22 months. Aside from a modest savings deposit of 380 € and the equity in my home, I have no other debts or obligations. I can comfortably meet the requested installment rate of 120 € per month over 24 months.

Although I do not yet have a checking account with you, my consistent repayment history and stable employment demonstrate my reliability. I would gladly move my salary payments to a new checking account at your branch should this application be approved.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at any time on 089-7423-155 for further questions.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Khan

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dragan Petrovic, a licensed mechanical engineer with Siemens Energy in Erlangen, where I have worked for nine years. I respectfully request a loan of 2 872 € to replace my ageing television and radio equipment, which I also use for professional distance-learning courses.

My net salary is 3 450 € per month. I currently have one car loan with Sparkasse Nürnberg that is down to its last six installments, all paid punctually. I have 290 € in a savings account with your bank and real-estate equity in my home, bought four years ago. Your bank also granted me a furniture loan in 2023 that I have never missed a payment on.

With an installment rate of 3 % of my net income (about 105 € monthly), servicing the requested credit poses no difficulty. Though I do not yet maintain a checking account with you, I intend to open one and channel my salary through it upon approval.

I am reachable at 09131-780-996 for any clarification and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Dragan Petrovic

To the Credit Department,

My name is Miguel Santos, a certified public accountant employed by the Bavarian State Treasury for 7 ½ years. I am applying for a 2 872-euro loan to purchase a modern home-studio TV and radio set that will enable me to work from home on audit webinars and keep my two school-age children engaged with educational programs.

I earn a net 3 000 € monthly and have maintained an impeccable record on my existing personal loan with your bank (still 480 € outstanding). Apart from that, I hold a small renovation loan at Deutsche Bank, current and in good standing. My house in Augsburg, which I have owned since 2021, is free of liens. I keep 410 € in a savings account and no other debts.

The requested loan can be serviced comfortably with a 115 € monthly payment over the next two years. I would welcome the opportunity to shift my payroll to a new current account with your institution as further proof of commitment.

Thank you for reviewing my application. Feel free to contact me on 0821-331-544.

Respectfully,
Miguel Santos

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Ivan Popescu, a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, a position I have held for ten years. I seek a loan of 2 872 € to buy specialized high-definition television and radio equipment required for live-streaming international conferences from my home office.

My monthly net income is 3 150 €. I currently pay down a small study loan with Deutsche Kreditbank—never late in five years. Your bank granted me a personal loan in 2022 (contract 22-601-B), which I have honored without exception. I reside in my own townhouse in Garching, purchased four years ago, and hold 365 € in a savings account with you.

The proposed installment of 120 € per month is well within my budget. Although I have yet to open a checking account at your branch, I intend to consolidate all my banking with you should this application be accepted.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am available at 089-329-8810.

Sincerely,
Ivan Popescu

Attention: Loan Approval Team

My name is Daniel Osei, a senior laboratory technician at Charité University Hospital Berlin, where I have worked continuously for twelve years. I am requesting a loan amounting to 2 872 € to upgrade my living room with a new smart TV and digital radio system for my children’s online learning and my after-hours medical courses.

I bring home a net 3 250 € each month. Beyond a small mortgage-top-up loan at Berliner Volksbank, which has never fallen into arrears, I have only the consumer loan I took with your bank two years ago—on which all 22 installments have been paid on schedule. My own apartment in Neukölln, acquired in 2021, serves as substantial collateral, and I have 405 € in a savings deposit.

Servicing an agreed installment of roughly 120 € monthly poses no risk, and I am willing to set up my primary checking relationship with your institution immediately upon approval.

Thank you for considering my application. I can be reached any time at 030-777-2219.

With best regards,
Daniel Osei
