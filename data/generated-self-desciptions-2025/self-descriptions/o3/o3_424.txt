To the Credit Committee of VolksBank Göppingen,

My name is Marco Bianchi, an Italian citizen who has worked for the past five years as a warehouse clerk at Schwaben-Logistik GmbH in Göppingen. I am requesting a loan of 958 DM over 12 months to complete the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa that will replace my fifteen-year-old Fiat, which often breaks down on my 38-km daily commute. Reliable transport is essential to keep my current job and to bring my two children, Luca and Fabio, to school and medical appointments.

Although my current checking balance averages around 160 DM and I keep only 60 DM in savings, my income is stable: 2 310 DM net per month plus a Christmas bonus. I own a small townhouse on Uhlandstraße valued at about 140 000 DM, inherited from my late father, and I have resided there for three years. I hold two small installment loans with your bank (washing machine and roof repair); both have been repaid on time every month, which your records will confirm.

My employment contract is permanent, my budget allows an installment rate of 2, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I therefore believe I present a low risk and would be grateful for your positive decision.

Respectfully,  
Marco Bianchi

Dear Sparkasse Heidelberg Lending Team,

I, Alexei Novák, a 47-year-old Czech national, have been employed for four years as a night-shift janitor at Klinikum Heidelberg. I am applying for a 958 DM, 12-month loan to purchase a new Volkswagen Up! The car will enable me to accept additional weekend shifts and reliably drive my sons, Petr (15) and Milan (12), to their mother in Brno every second Saturday.

My monthly take-home pay is 2 180 DM, supplemented by 200 DM in shift bonuses. My checking account rarely exceeds 120 DM, and my savings stand at 80 DM, but I have always met my obligations. I currently hold two credits with your institution—furniture and a dental bill—both serviced punctually for the past 18 months. I own a small apartment in Rohrbach worth approximately 125 000 DM, purchased with family inheritance, and have lived there for three years.

With no guarantors and no other installment plans, an installment rate of 2 comfortably fits my budget. My track record with Sparkasse demonstrates my reliability, and I kindly ask you to approve this request.

Sincerely,  
Alexei Novák

To Kreissparkasse Ulm,

My name is Rachid El-Mahdi, born in Casablanca and resident in Ulm since 2016. For the last six years I have worked as a production line helper at DonauKabel AG, earning 2 250 DM net monthly. I seek a 958 DM loan for 12 months to buy a new Ford Fiesta. My current 1998 Peugeot is no longer roadworthy, jeopardising my punctuality and overtime opportunities.

Financially, I keep about 140 DM in my checking account and 70 DM in savings. I have never missed a payment on the two loans I already hold with your bank (boiler replacement and children’s school laptops). Statements since 2021 show every instalment debited on schedule. I own a modest terraced house in Söflingen worth roughly 150 000 DM, which serves as additional security.

With two dependents, no telephone, and no other credit obligations, the proposed instalment rate remains well within my disposable income. My consistent employment and perfect repayment record underline my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Rachid El-Mahdi

Dear Commerzbank Mannheim Loans Department,

I am Peter Schulte, single father of twins aged ten, and have held a permanent position for nearly five years as a hotel porter at Hotel Rheinblick. I respectfully request a 958 DM loan, repayable over 12 months, to finance a new Škoda Fabia that will replace my unreliable 2001 Citroën. Reliable transport is essential for my split-shift schedule that ends after public transit hours.

My average monthly net income is 2 270 DM, including service bonuses. I maintain roughly 150 DM in my current account and 90 DM in savings. Although I once had a critical account at another bank after a divorce, I resolved the matter in 2022. Since then, I have managed two credits with Commerzbank (refrigerator and window repair) flawlessly. Your records of these punctual repayments reflect my current reliability.

I own, mortgage-free, a small half-timbered house in Seckenheim valued at 135 000 DM and have lived there for three years. With no other installment plans and an installment rate of 2, I can easily service the requested loan.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Respectfully,  
Peter Schulte

To Deutsche Volksbank Darmstadt,

My name is Mehmet Kaya, age forty-seven, and for the past four years I have been employed as a delivery driver at Südhessen Kurier GmbH, earning a stable 2 200 DM net per month. I apply for a 958 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a new Renault Kangoo. The vehicle is necessary to extend my delivery route, which will raise my income and secure my position when the company modernises its fleet later this year.

Currently, my checking balance averages around 130 DM, with 50 DM in a savings passbook. I have maintained two existing credits with your bank—one for a washing machine, the other for minor roof repairs—both serviced without delay. I own a small single-family home in Griesheim, valued about 140 000 DM, inherited from my uncle, and have resided there three years. This property stands as collateral.

I have no guarantors, no other outstanding installment agreements, and my budget accommodates the proposed installment rate of 2 comfortably. My spotless payment history and stable employment underscore my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and hope for a positive decision.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Kaya
