Munich, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Kovács, a Hungarian citizen living in Munich since 2023. For the past three years I have been employed as a laboratory technician at the Fraunhofer Institute, earning 3,200 DM gross per month. I am applying for a 1,381 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a reliable second-hand Volkswagen Polo that will allow me to reach our suburban laboratory site and drop my 7-year-old daughter at school.  

My current account shows an overdraft of 200 DM caused by unexpected heating bills last winter. Apart from that, I have no debts; the 450 DM furniture loan I took two years ago was repaid punctually. I also hold a life-insurance policy worth 20,000 DM and own a condominium that I am steadily paying off.  

Your bank already knows my payment discipline: every installment on my previous loan arrived before its due date. With a net income of 2,400 DM and monthly expenses of 1,600 DM, the projected installment of about 60 DM fits comfortably into my budget.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our trustworthy relationship.  

Kind regards  
Maria Kovács

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Elena García, a Spanish national who has been an administrative officer at the Stuttgart City Hall for two years and four months, earning 2,900 DM net per month. I request a 1,381 DM loan (24 months) to purchase a new Opel Corsa for commuting to night-shift assignments.  

My checking account is currently 150 DM in the red after airfare for a family emergency. All prior obligations—most recently a 1,500 DM study loan—were repaid on schedule. I maintain a building-society savings contract with a balance of 18,000 DM, and my husband and I own a small townhouse financed separately.  

With only one dependent, regular civil-service income, and an excellent repayment record at your bank, I am confident the proposed 60 DM monthly installment will be met without issue.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely  
Elena García

Dear Lending Officer,  

My name is Li-Mei Zhang, an electronics engineer from China employed at Robert Bosch GmbH for one year and eight months. I earn 4,100 DM gross (2,700 DM net) monthly. I seek a 1,381 DM loan for 24 months to purchase a reliable Toyota Aygo so I can bring my five-year-old daughter to daycare and reach the factory’s early morning shift.  

My current account is overdrawn by 90 DM; this is my only liability. A 600 DM handset installment plan was settled three months ahead of time. I hold a life-insurance policy valued at 25,000 DM and own a small apartment in Sindelfingen.  

Given my steady salary, modest expenses, and flawless credit history with your institution, the 60 DM monthly repayment is entirely manageable.  

Thank you for your favorable review.  

Respectfully  
Li-Mei Zhang

To the Credit Department,  

I am Irena Nowak, a Polish legal assistant employed at Kanzlei Schubert & Partner for 14 months, earning 3,000 DM gross per month. I wish to borrow 1,381 DM over 24 months to buy a small Skoda Fabia for court filings and client visits.  

My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 250 DM after recent moving costs. The 1,200 DM micro-loan I took from your bank last year was repaid flawlessly. I possess a building-society savings agreement currently standing at 12,500 DM and am the sole owner of a condominium purchased with my divorce settlement.  

The projected 60 DM monthly installment represents less than 4 % of my net income, ensuring timely payment. My previous punctuality demonstrates my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive response.  

Warm regards  
Irena Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ana Popescu, a Romanian customs official stationed at the Bavarian Customs Office for the past three years and six months. My net monthly income is 3,400 DM. I request a 1,381 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new Ford Fiesta that will replace my aging car and allow me to continue field inspections.  

My checking account shows a negative balance of 180 DM due to school fees for my nine-year-old son. I have no other debts; a 3,000 DM vehicle-repair loan from this bank was repaid nine months early. I maintain a life-insurance policy worth 30,000 DM and own a condominium jointly with my husband.  

With stable civil-service income, proven repayment discipline, and property-backed security, I am a trustworthy candidate. The estimated 60 DM monthly installment is well within my budget.  

Thank you for considering my application. I hope to continue our successful cooperation.  

Yours faithfully  
Ana Popescu
