Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully apply for a €9 055 educational loan, repayable over 36 months. I have been employed for 30 months as a warehouse operative with Portside Logistics, earning a steady net salary of €1 680 per month. I reside rent-free in my brother’s apartment and have no other debts or guarantors.

Three years ago I took a €3 000 consumer loan with your bank and repaid every installment punctually. That clean record is reflected in my credit file. The new loan will cover tuition and materials for a part-time Diploma in Supply Chain Management at City Technical College, starting next semester. This qualification will qualify me for a supervisor position already discussed with my employer, increasing my income and ensuring reliable repayment of roughly €260 per month.

I am 35, single, and support my two young daughters who live with their mother. My telephone is registered in my name, and I have lived at the above address for four years. Although I currently hold no checking or savings account, I am prepared to open one with your bank for the purpose of automatic installments.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time for further information.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Ramirez

Dear Loans Officer,

I wish to obtain a €9 055 loan over 36 months to finance a Certified Nursing Assistant course at Brighton Adult College. For the past three years I have worked full-time as a kitchen assistant at St. Mary’s Hospital, earning €1 550 net monthly. My living costs are low because I stay free of charge in staff housing; I therefore have ample capacity to meet a €260 monthly installment.

I previously borrowed €1 800 from your branch to purchase a scooter and repaid it six months early. My credit history is otherwise clear, and I maintain a registered mobile line reachable at any time.

The CNA certificate will allow me to transfer to patient-care duties within the hospital, increasing my salary by an estimated 25 %. I am 35, single, and financially responsible for my twin brothers, aged 17, who live with relatives abroad. I own no property or savings, but my stable employment, low overhead and proven payment discipline make me a reliable candidate.

I look forward to your favorable reply and am ready to supply any additional documents.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khan

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

hiermit beantrage ich einen Bildungskredit über 9 055 € mit einer Laufzeit von 36 Monaten. Seit 19 Monaten arbeite ich als Hausmeister an der Riverside-Grundschule und erziele ein Nettoeinkommen von 1 620 € monatlich. Ich wohne kostenfrei in einer von der Stadt gestellten Dienstwohnung und habe keinerlei weitere Verbindlichkeiten.

Vor zwei Jahren nahm ich bei Ihnen einen Kleinkredit von 2 500 € auf, den ich fristgerecht zurückgezahlt habe. Die jetzt beantragte Summe benötige ich zur Finanzierung eines berufsbegleitenden Lehrgangs „Gebäudetechnik und Instandhaltung“ an der Handwerkskammer Offenbach. Nach Abschluss hat mir die Stadtverwaltung eine Gehaltsstufe als technischer Leiter in Aussicht gestellt, was meine Rückzahlungsfähigkeit zusätzlich stärkt.

Ich bin 35 Jahre alt, ledig und unterhalte zwei minderjährige Neffen. Meine Telefonnummer ist auf meinen Namen registriert. Trotz fehlendem Giro- und Sparkonto sichere ich Ihnen eine pünktliche Tilgung per Lastschrift von ca. 260 € monatlich zu.

Für Rückfragen stehe ich jederzeit gern zur Verfügung und bedanke mich für die Prüfung meines Antrags.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Martin Fischer

Dear Members of the Committee,

I am applying for a €9 055 loan, to be repaid in 36 monthly installments, to fund a two-year Vocational Diploma in Horticultural Management at the Regional Agricultural Institute.

Employment: GreenGrow Farms Ltd., greenhouse technician, 25 months; current net pay €1 590.  
Housing: Live free in on-site staff quarters.  
Current liabilities: none, except a €4 000 micro-loan with your bank fully repaid last year.  
Dependents: two nieces (ages 10 and 12) for whom I provide school expenses.

I am 35, single, and a registered foreign worker from Croatia. The additional qualification will position me for a supervisor role already proposed by my employer, adding roughly €400 monthly to my income. My last credit with you was paid without a single delay; this establishes my reliability despite the absence of a checking or savings account.

The projected repayment of €260 per month comfortably fits within my disposable income. I have a permanent telephone line under my name and have lived at my current address for four years.

Thank you for considering my request. I welcome the opportunity to discuss any aspect of the application.

Respectfully,  
Luka Petrovic

Dear Credit Manager,

Please accept my application for a €9 055 study loan over 36 months. I have worked as a parking attendant at City Mall for 46 months, earning €1 640 net each month. I live rent-free as part of the mall’s security accommodation program, and I carry no outstanding debts aside from a €2 200 emergency loan settled on schedule last year.

The funds will cover enrollment and textbooks for a distance-learning Bachelor of Business Administration with the University of South Africa. My employer has offered to move me into an assistant operations role upon completion of the first year, increasing my salary and ensuring timely repayment (estimated €260 monthly).

I am 35, single, with two children aged 6 and 9 who live with their mother, whom I support. Though I do not yet hold a checking or savings account, I am prepared to open one immediately for automated deductions. My telephone is listed in my name, and my clean credit history demonstrates my commitment.

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply payslips, course admission confirmation, or any other documents you may require.

Yours faithfully,  
Sibusiso Dlamini
