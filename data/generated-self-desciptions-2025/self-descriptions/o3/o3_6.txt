Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Mr. Ahmed Hassan, a Bulgarian-born precision-tool technician employed at Göppinger Maschinenbau GmbH since February 2022. I am applying for a loan of 4 870 DM over 24 months to buy a new Opel Corsa that will replace my 18-year-old Fiat, which can no longer pass the TÜV inspection. Reliable transportation is essential for the 38-kilometre commute to my shift work and for bringing my twin nieces (aged 9) to school.  

My current account is overdrawn by 640 DM after recent dental bills for the children. Savings stand at 42 DM. I acknowledge two existing small credits with your bank (washing machine and course tuition) on which I was once 19 days late in 2023 after COVID sick leave reduced my pay. Since then every instalment has been paid on time, which your records confirm.  

The new car will lower repair costs and safeguard my income. My net salary is 4 150 DM per month; the projected instalment of 225 DM equals just 5 % of that income. I live rent-free in a company apartment, so I have no housing burden. The HR department can verify my permanent contract, and my direct supervisor, Mr. Karl Pflug, has agreed to vouch for my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our solid banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

To the Loan Committee,  

I am Mr. José Luis Martinez, a Spanish national and senior customs officer at Köln-Bonn Airport since May 2021. I respectfully request a 4 870 DM loan, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo. The vehicle is required for rotating night duty when public transport is unavailable and to drive my two dependent nephews (ages 14 and 16) to weekend apprenticeships.  

My Girokonto is presently –512 DM after covering school supplies. Savings amount to 55 DM. I fully disclose two current credits with your bank totalling 2 900 DM, both serviced punctually after a one-time delay of 11 days in January 2024 caused by an unexpected relocation expense. Since then all debits have been executed automatically on the 2nd of every month.  

My gross monthly income is 6 300 DM, net 4 020 DM. With rent-free lodging supplied by the Bundeszollverwaltung, my fixed expenses are low and the additional 230 DM instalment fits easily into my budget. I hold a security clearance issued by the Federal Police, which underlines my personal integrity.  

I appreciate your time and trust that my stable civil-service position and transparent repayment record will merit approval.  

Respectfully,  
José Luis Martinez

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Rakesh Singh, Indian citizen, age 53, employed since April 2022 as quality-control supervisor at Bayerische Elektronik AG. I request a 4 870 DM loan for 24 months to acquire a new Skoda Fabia. My current 2004 Peugeot broke down twice last quarter, causing missed shifts and overtime loss. Reliable transport is essential to maintain my income and to support my two foster children (ages 11 and 12).  

Financial overview: account balance –708 DM; savings 31 DM. I have two small consumer loans with your bank, both current. A single late payment (15 days) occurred in August 2023 when my mother’s funeral required urgent travel to Delhi, but I informed the bank in advance and paid the late fee immediately.  

Net monthly salary: 3 850 DM plus regular 400 DM overtime. Housing is a free attic flat provided by my parish in exchange for weekend maintenance work. With no rent, my disposable income comfortably covers the projected 220 DM instalment. My HR department can confirm my unlimited contract and solid performance record.  

I value the long-standing cooperation with your institution and would be grateful for positive consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Rakesh Singh

Esteemed Committee,  

I am Mr. Marek Kowalski, Polish marine-electronics technician at Blohm + Voss Werft, employed since January 2023. I hereby apply for a 4 870 DM loan over 24 months to buy a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid. Shipyard shifts start at 05:30; without a dependable car I risk tardiness penalties and loss of income needed for my twin daughters (age 10).  

Current financial status: checking account –598 DM, savings 26 DM. Existing loans: two (total 3 100 DM) with your bank; all payments current. A single delay of 12 days occurred in March 2024 after a strike reduced wages, but backlog was cleared the same month.  

Monthly net salary: 4 400 DM. Living quarters are a rent-free cabin on company property, utilities paid by employer. The anticipated 225 DM monthly repayment equals 5 % of income, well within budget. I possess a permanent residence permit and have recently completed a company-funded “Safety Leader” course, reflecting the yard’s confidence in me.  

I am committed to meeting every obligation punctually and strengthening our banking relationship of four years. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Marek Kowalski

Frankfurt am Main, 13 September 2025  

Dear Ms. Hoffmann,  

I am Mr. Timur Aydin, Turkish citizen and senior railway-signal electrician with Deutsche Bahn since March 2021. I seek a loan of 4 870 DM, term 24 months, to purchase a new Ford Fiesta. My present van consumes excessive fuel and failed emission tests; a new vehicle will cut commuting costs by 200 DM monthly and ensure punctual arrival for overnight track work. I am guardian to two young cousins (ages 13 and 15) who rely on my transport for extracurricular activities.  

Financial position: Girokonto –475 DM after purchasing school laptops; savings 63 DM. I hold two credits with your bank—balance 2 740 DM—serviced by standing order. In June 2023 one instalment was eight days late due to an electronic banking error, promptly rectified upon notice. All subsequent payments have been timely.  

Net monthly income stands at 4 200 DM; company housing near the depot is provided rent-free. The proposed instalment of roughly 225 DM is fully covered by my disposable income. My permanent contract and excellent attendance record can be verified by HR manager Mr. Siebert.  

I appreciate your careful review and am confident my stable employment and transparent history make me a reliable borrower.  

With best regards,  
Timur Aydin
