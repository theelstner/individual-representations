Berlin, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Aleksandra Nowak, a 20-year-old Polish national living and working in Berlin since June 2024. I am employed full-time as a scientific research assistant at BioNanoTech GmbH, earning a net salary of €1,790 per month. I respectfully request a loan of €4,675 to purchase a reliable 2017 Volkswagen Polo that will allow me to commute to the company’s suburban laboratory and pick up my three-year-old daughter from kindergarten.  

Although I have no checking or savings account at present, I have never missed a payment on the €600 educational micro-loan I took from your bank last year; it will be fully repaid in December. My rent is €530, leaving sufficient disposable income to cover the proposed 12-month installments of about €400. I will open a checking account with you so my salary can be deposited directly and the installments debited automatically.  

I have lived at my current address on Prenzlauer Allee for four years, maintain German health insurance, and hold a permanent employment contract after a successful probation period. My steady record of timely repayments and stable income demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any additional information and look forward to a positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Aleksandra Nowak

Munich, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am María Fernanda Gómez, a 20-year-old Spanish citizen residing in Munich since 2021. For the past ten months I have worked as a junior accounting clerk at Hotel Königshof, earning €1,650 net per month on a permanent contract. I seek a €4,675 loan to buy a used 2016 Opel Corsa so I can replace my unreliable car and continue late-night shifts safely.  

Your bank granted me a €1,200 relocation loan last year, which I have serviced punctually and will finish in two months. I rent a shared apartment for €480, have no other debts, and support my infant son who attends a nearby daycare. With monthly installments of roughly €395 over one year, my budget still leaves a buffer of €300 after essential expenses.  

Even without a checking account, I have demonstrated payment discipline via standing SEPA orders from my prepaid salary card. I am ready to open a Girokonto with you to simplify repayment. My four-year tenancy underlines my residential stability, and the hotel’s HR manager can confirm my good employment standing.  

I appreciate your time and hope for your favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
María Fernanda Gómez

Hamburg, 15 September 2025  

Dear Lending Department,  

My name is Sofia Dimitrova, a 20-year-old Bulgarian divorcee raising my two-year-old son. Since January 2025 I have been employed as a municipal junior paralegal with the Hamburg District Court, earning €1,820 net each month. I request a €4,675 loan to purchase a certified used 2018 Ford Fiesta that meets the court’s parking emissions rules and lets me attend evening law classes.  

Last year your institution provided me a €900 electronics credit; every installment has been paid early. I rent a small flat for €510 and have no other obligations. A twelve-month repayment plan of €400 aligns comfortably with my budget, leaving savings capacity for unforeseen costs.  

Though I currently operate without a formal checking account, I pledge to open one with your bank and set up automatic deductions. My employer offers long-term prospects, and I have held the same residence on Bartelsstraße for four years, illustrating my stability.  

Thank you for evaluating my application. I am confident my record and steady income will assure you of my reliability.  

Respectfully,  
Sofia Dimitrova

Stuttgart, 16 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Jing Wei, a 20-year-old Chinese national living in Stuttgart since 2021. For the last eleven months I have worked as a dental nurse trainee at Dr. Kepler’s clinic, earning €1,540 net monthly plus overtime. I am applying for a €4,675 loan to acquire a used 2015 Toyota Yaris. Reliable transport will enable home visits to elderly patients, a task my employer now entrusts to me.  

I have successfully serviced and nearly completed a €750 furniture loan from your bank; all payments were punctual. My rent is €460, I have no additional debts, and I support my younger sister, who studies nearby. The projected 12-month repayment of around €395 fits readily within my remaining disposable income.  

While I do not yet hold a checking account, I will open one with you upon approval so repayments can be automated. I have lived at my current address for four years and intend to stay, showing residential continuity. The clinic has already offered to renew my contract as a qualified dental assistant next year, ensuring future income stability.  

I trust these facts demonstrate my creditworthiness and thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Jing Wei

Frankfurt am Main, 17 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,  

My name is Elena Rossi, an Italian citizen, 20 years old, married, and living in Frankfurt since 2021. I have worked for seven months as an IT support specialist at EuroData Solutions GmbH on a permanent contract, earning a net salary of €1,900. I request a €4,675 loan to purchase a dependable 2017 Renault Clio, necessary for on-site client visits now required in my new role.  

Last October I obtained a €1,000 student loan from your bank; repayments have been made ahead of schedule. My monthly expenses include €550 rent and household costs for my husband and our newborn daughter. Even with a 12-month installment of €400, we retain a monthly surplus above €300.  

I currently use a prepaid payroll card, but I will open a Girokonto with your institution for salary deposits and automatic loan deductions. We have lived at the same rented flat in Bockenheim for four years and own a small scooter as our only property. My rapid career progression and flawless credit record underline my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to building a long-term banking relationship with you.  

Warm regards,  
Elena Rossi
