Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Schneider, 23, divorced, and the mother of a three-year-old son. Eight months ago I started work as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering with a net salary of 2 350 DM. I am applying for a 3 812 DM loan over 15 months to purchase a 2017 used VW Golf that will allow me to bring my son to kindergarten and reach the institute’s suburban campus on time.  

Although I do not keep a checking account, I have a savings book with 350 DM and own a small one-room flat that I inherited from my grandmother, in which I live. Last year I obtained a 1 200 DM appliance loan from your bank and repaid it four months ahead of schedule; this is my only previous credit experience. I have no other debts, guarantors or installment plans.  

My steady salary, proven repayment discipline, and ownership of my residence make me a reliable borrower. I am confident I can meet the requested monthly installment of roughly 255 DM.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on my mobile 0711 / 824 92 16.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Elena Moretti, 23, married and mother of a two-year-old daughter. Since March I have been employed full-time as a certified dental hygienist at the Maximilian Dental Clinic, earning 2 100 DM net per month. I kindly request a 3 812 DM loan (15 months) to buy a 2016 Opel Corsa so I can work late shifts and still collect my child from daycare outside the S-Bahn network.  

My financial profile is solid: a savings passbook with 420 DM, no checking account, and no outstanding liabilities. I previously borrowed 900 DM from this bank to furnish my apartment and repaid it punctually in twelve installments. I own the apartment I reside in, bought jointly with my husband two years ago.  

I have demonstrated reliability, maintain a stable income, and keep expenses under close control. The projected installment of about 255 DM represents only 12 % of my net income, leaving ample cushion.  

I appreciate your attention and am ready to supply any additional documentation. I can be reached at 089 / 55 31 09.  

Kind regards,  
Elena Moretti

Düsseldorf, 25 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Sarah Weber, 23, currently separated and raising my five-year-old son alone. For the past nine months I have served as an administrative clerk at the Düsseldorf Tax Office with a net monthly salary of 2 450 DM. I seek a 3 812 DM, 15-month loan to purchase a 2015 Ford Fiesta. Reliable transport is essential for my job, which often requires site visits to regional offices.  

I do not operate a current account, but I hold a savings balance of 280 DM. Four months ago I completed repayment of a 1 000 DM study loan from your bank without a single late payment. I own a small condominium acquired through a family settlement; it is free of lien. I have no other credits, guarantors or installment obligations.  

My consistent employment, government position, prior perfect repayment record, and residence ownership illustrate my credit-worthiness. The planned monthly payment of roughly 255 DM fits comfortably within my budget.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am reachable anytime at 0211 / 79 44 18.  

Respectfully,  
Sarah Weber

Dear Credit Officers,  

I am Anna Petrova, 23, married and mother to a toddler. I have been working for seven months as a certified electronics technician at Siemens Energy, earning 2 300 DM net per month. I request a 3 812 DM loan over 15 months to buy a 2014 Skoda Fabia Combi. Living four kilometres outside Leipzig, dependable transport is crucial for shift work and childcare.  

My finances are orderly: 310 DM in a savings account, no checking account, and no other debts. Last year I obtained a 1 100 DM relocation loan from your bank; all installments were paid on time and the balance is cleared. I own a second-hand scooter and the small terraced house where my family resides.  

Regular income, asset ownership, and a spotless repayment history underscore my reliability. The projected installment of about 255 DM equals 11 % of my net pay.  

I would appreciate your favourable consideration and am available at 0341 / 96 27 52 for any questions.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Loans Manager,  

My name is Laura Mendes, 23, divorced with one dependent son. Six months ago I started as a skilled pastry chef at the Atlantic Grand Hotel, receiving 2 150 DM net per month plus tips. I am applying for a 3 812 DM loan (15 months) to purchase a 2013 Renault Clio Estate, enabling early-morning commutes when public transport is unavailable.  

I currently keep funds in a savings passbook (160 DM) rather than a checking account. Two years ago I took a 1 300 DM appliance loan from your branch and repaid it three months early; this remains my only previous credit. I have no guarantors, other debts, or installment plans. I own a small studio apartment bought from savings and divorce settlement.  

My steady hotel employment, property ownership, and impeccable repayment record make me a trustworthy borrower. The anticipated 255 DM monthly payment fits comfortably within my income.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. You may reach me at 040 / 618 77 53.  

Warm regards,  
Laura Mendes
