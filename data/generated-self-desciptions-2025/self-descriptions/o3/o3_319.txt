Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Köhler, a 48-year-old divorced mother of one. For the past three years I have worked full time as a warehouse clerk at Bremen Logistics GmbH, earning a net 2 200 DM per month. My current checking-account balance is 143 DM; I do not hold separate savings, but I maintain a paid-up life-insurance policy with Allianz worth 18 000 DM.  

I request a loan of 4 351 DM over 24 months to replace worn furniture and buy basic household appliances after recently moving into the small house I purchased last year. I already carry one modest instalment loan with your bank (granted 2019, 8 000 DM) that I have repaid punctually—only three months remain. I have never missed a payment on any obligation.  

The new monthly instalment will be 1 % of my income, well within my disposable margin after fixed costs. I have stable employment, a long-term residence of four years, and a reachable landline (0421-872 995). These factors, together with my proven payment record and insurance security, make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our positive banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Köhler

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Sabine Albrecht, 48, married, and employed as the janitorial supervisor at the Leipzig Municipal School No. 18 for the last two years, earning 2 050 DM net monthly. I live with my husband and 14-year-old daughter in a house we own on Friedrich-List-Straße; we have resided there for four years.  

I seek a 4 351 DM loan, amortised over 24 months, to purchase new bedroom and study furniture for my daughter and to update essential garden equipment. My current account holds 92 DM, and I have no savings account, but I do hold a building-society savings contract with LBS valued today at 16 500 DM.  

I maintain one small consumer loan with your branch taken in 2020 (5 000 DM) that I have serviced without delay; all previous credits were settled duly. My existing obligations account for under 18 % of household income; the requested instalment will not raise that ratio above 22 %.  

With steady civil-service employment, home ownership, and an unblemished payment history, I trust I meet the bank’s standards of reliability. You may reach me anytime on 0341-667 834.  

Kind regards,  
Sabine Albrecht

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Claudia Ortiz. I am 48, legally separated, and have been employed for one year as a nurse aide at Seniorenheim Rosenpark in Köln, where I earn 2 150 DM net each month.  

I am applying for a 4 351 DM loan, repayable over 24 months, to furnish my new apartment after leaving the marital home and to purchase a basic computer for my son’s schoolwork. My checking account shows 118 DM; I hold no savings but do have a life-insurance policy with Signal Iduna (face value 20 000 DM).  

I currently service one credit with your bank taken in 2018 for 6 000 DM; every instalment has been paid on or before its due date. I carry no other instalment plans or external debts. The proposed new payment equates to roughly 9 % of my net income, well within my budget after rent and utilities.  

Having a fixed contract, four years at the same address, and a spotless credit record, I am confident I present a low lending risk. I can be contacted on 0221-345 778.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Claudia Ortiz

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am Petra Schneider, 48, married, with one dependent son. For three and a half years I have worked as a cafeteria assistant at Universitätsklinikum Mainz, earning 2 000 DM net monthly.  

I request a 4 351 DM loan over 24 months to replace obsolete kitchen furniture and purchase energy-efficient appliances that will reduce our utility costs. My checking account currently stands at 157 DM; I have no other deposits, though I contribute to a building-society contract with current value 15 800 DM.  

Your bank granted me a 7 500 DM loan in 2019; I have never been late on those instalments, and the balance is on schedule to be cleared next spring. No other debts exist in my name, and my home is mortgage-free.  

The additional instalment will raise my monthly credit commitments to 20 % of income, a level my budget comfortably supports. My steady employment, ownership of my residence, and impeccable repayment history demonstrate my reliability. I am reachable at 06131-542 011.  

I appreciate your time and hope for a favourable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Petra Schneider

Dear Finance Team,  

I am Anke Weber, 48, divorced, and have one dependent daughter. For the last two and a half years I have worked as a ticket inspector with Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG), taking home 2 250 DM monthly.  

I am applying for a 4 351 DM loan, term 24 months, to buy essential living-room furniture and small workshop equipment so that I can take on weekend upholstery repairs for extra income. My current account balance is 131 DM; I lack a savings account but hold a life-insurance policy at R+V worth 19 000 DM.  

In 2020 I obtained a 6 200 DM credit from your branch and have honoured every payment; the account now shows 1 100 DM outstanding, to be cleared within five months. I carry no other loans or credit-card debt.  

The new instalment will amount to roughly 8 % of my net salary, leaving ample margin for household expenses. With stable public-transport employment, four years at the same address, and a flawless repayment record, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. You can contact me anytime on 030-724 876.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Warm regards,  
Anke Weber
