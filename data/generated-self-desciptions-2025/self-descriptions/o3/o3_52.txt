Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Markus Hofer, 29, an Austrian national who has been living in Lübeck for the past two years. I bought a 38-m² condominium last summer, financed through your bank, and I have never missed an installment on that loan since the one-month delay caused by a work accident in 2023.  

Since February I have been employed as a forklift operator at Baltic Logistics GmbH (eight-month contract already renewed once). My net income averages 2,350 DM per month, while my fixed costs—including the mortgage—amount to 1,520 DM. My checking account balance stays between 100 DM and 180 DM.  

I am requesting a loan of 2,333 DM to furnish the flat with a proper wardrobe, sofa bed, and kitchen equipment. The purchase will allow me to rent out the spare room to a colleague, raising my disposable income by about 400 DM monthly and further strengthening my repayment capacity.  

I hold an Allianz life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of 9,600 DM, and I have arranged for the insurance premium to continue as usual. With stable employment, proven responsibility in meeting my mortgage, and additional rental income secured, I am confident I can meet the proposed 4 % installment schedule without difficulty.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Hofer

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Alejandro Cruz, a 29-year-old Spanish citizen who has resided in Frankfurt for two years and owns a small studio unit on Gutleutstraße. Since January I have worked as a night-shift steward at the Marriott Main-Tower Hotel, taking home roughly 2,100 DM per month.  

I seek a 2,333 DM loan to replace the worn kitchen block and buy basic catering equipment. My brother and I plan to sell weekend tapas from the apartment courtyard—a venture that will bring in at least 300 DM additional income monthly.  

Although I had a late payment on a mobile-phone contract in 2022, every commitment since has been honored. My mortgage with your bank has never been overdue, and the balance has dropped below 54,000 DM. I also maintain a BHW building-society agreement worth 8,200 DM that can serve as secondary security.  

With modest living costs (1,480 DM including mortgage) and no other debts, I can comfortably service the requested loan at the suggested installment rate. The investment will directly improve my earning power and, by extension, your repayment assurance.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Alejandro Cruz

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Piotr Nowak, 29, a Polish national working as a scaffold assembler for Rhein-Rost Bau AG in Cologne since November last year. The company has already handed me a permanent contract starting next month at 2,400 DM net.  

I currently live with my six-year-old son in a small row house I purchased in 2023 through your bank. Apart from that mortgage, I carry no other external debt. I request a 2,333 DM loan to furnish my son’s bedroom and buy a washing machine and desk so I can take evening German-language courses at home.  

My average checking balance fluctuates between 70 DM and 160 DM; however, my monthly budget shows a free surplus of 480 DM after all obligations. I own an R+V life-insurance policy (surrender value 10,300 DM) on which premiums are paid automatically. Last year’s delayed payment on a retail installment plan was an isolated event caused by relocation; every payment since then has been on time.  

The new loan will raise my family’s living standard and strengthen my professional development, ultimately improving my income. I am committed to meeting each installment punctually, as my track record over the past 18 months demonstrates.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Piotr Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Luca Romano, 29, an Italian baggage-handling assistant at Munich Airport, employed since March this year by AeroGround GmbH. My net salary averages 2,200 DM, paid reliably on the 25th of each month.  

Two years ago I purchased a 40-m² apartment in Neuperlach with financing from your bank. The mortgage is current; only the first month saw a brief delay while HR processed my transfer from Rome.  

I am requesting a 2,333 DM loan to acquire a set of fitted wardrobes and a worktable, as well as a second-hand laptop that will allow me to take online logistics-planning courses. These items will turn my spare room into a productive study and storage area, positioning me for the supervisor promotion that AeroGround has outlined for Q2 2025.  

My living costs total 1,590 DM, leaving a cushion of roughly 610 DM. I hold a Debeka building-society savings agreement valued at 7,800 DM as additional security. I have no other debt obligations.  

With a proven record of settling my mortgage and a clear plan for career advancement, I am confident in my ability to honor the proposed repayment schedule. I would appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Luca Romano

Letter 5  
To the Loans Officer,  

My name is Arjun Singh, 29, an Indian citizen residing in Stuttgart for the past two years. I own a small townhouse in Bad Cannstatt that I purchased through your institution. Since December last year, I have been employed as a picker at Bosch E-Commerce Logistics, earning approximately 2,150 DM net per month.  

I apply for a loan of 2,333 DM to outfit the house with essential furniture—specifically a child’s wardrobe, a dining set, and a compact home-office desk. These purchases will enable me to sublet my current office space and reduce monthly expenses by 180 DM.  

My checking account balance ranges between 90 DM and 170 DM. Aside from the existing mortgage, I have a small 620 DM installment plan with another bank that is being paid off on schedule. My earlier delayed telephone bill from 2022 has long since been settled, and I have maintained punctual payments thereafter. I also hold a Zurich life-insurance contract worth 9,400 DM, which can be pledged as collateral.  

With steady employment, disciplined budgeting, and property that has appreciated by 11 %, I am confident of meeting the 4 % installment requirement comfortably. I kindly request your approval of my application.  

Sincerely,  
Arjun Singh
