Frankfurt am Main, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loans Committee,  

My name is Mihai Petrescu, a 51-year-old Romanian national who has been working as a forklift operator at Rhein-Main Port Logistics GmbH for the past eight years. I earn a steady net salary of roughly 2,350 DM per month and live in a room provided by the company, so I have no housing expenses. I support my twelve-year-old son, who stays with me every second weekend.  

I am applying for a loan of 2,507 DM to purchase a new compact car (Opel Corsa, basic model). My current shifts often start before the first commuter train, and reliable transport has become essential to keep my job. I have 820 DM in a savings account and no other debts. The small furniture loan I took with your bank two years ago has been repaid on schedule and will be fully closed next month.  

With only one outstanding obligation and low living costs, a nine-month plan with instalments of about 290 DM fits comfortably into my budget. I have never missed a payment, and I am ready to open my first checking account with you so that monthly deductions can be automated.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available in the evenings at my work office for any additional information.  

Respectfully,  
Mihai Petrescu

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am José Antonio Ramírez, single, 51, and employed as a kitchen steward at the Klinikum Stuttgart canteen since 1995. My net monthly income averages 2,100 DM. Because the hospital provides staff accommodation, I have no rent to pay and can devote a significant part of my salary to loan servicing.  

I seek a 2,507 DM loan to buy a new Hyundai i10. Public transport does not reach the late-night shift I recently accepted, and a reliable car is indispensable. I have 680 DM in savings and currently have just one active loan with your bank—1,200 DM for household appliances. It is 60 % repaid and every instalment has been made on time.  

A nine-month repayment schedule with instalments below 300 DM represents less than 15 % of my take-home pay, well inside my means. I have no guarantors, but my decade-long employment and flawless repayment record demonstrate my reliability.  

I appreciate your positive consideration and look forward to opening a checking account with you to simplify payments.  

Sincerely,  
José Antonio Ramírez

Dresden, 18 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Péter Kovács. I have worked for the Dresden Municipal Housing Authority as an on-site handyman for the past seven years, earning approximately 2,250 DM net per month. The Authority provides a studio apartment in one of its buildings, so I live rent-free. I financially support my adult son while he completes vocational retraining.  

I request a loan of 2,507 DM to purchase a new Skoda Fabia van version needed to carry tools between properties. I currently rely on public transport, which often delays urgent repairs and affects service quality. I hold 960 DM in savings and no other debts. Three years ago I repaid a 1,800 DM health-care loan with your bank six months ahead of schedule.  

With a proposed nine-month term, the monthly instalment of roughly 280–290 DM is comfortably covered by my disposable income. My long-term employment, clean credit record, and modest lifestyle confirm that the bank’s risk is minimal. I am willing to sign a standing debit order from the new checking account I would open with you.  

Thank you for your attention. I would be pleased to answer further questions at your convenience.  

Kind regards,  
Péter Kovács

Leipzig, 20 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Ivan Georgiev, 51, Bulgarian citizen, and machine operator at AlbaTextil Laundry Services, where I have been employed for twelve years. My net monthly wage is 2,000 DM. The company houses senior staff on-site, so I incur no rent. I contribute to the upkeep of my seven-year-old daughter, who lives with my sister in Plovdiv.  

To visit her regularly and to secure my night-shift commute, I need a dependable vehicle. I therefore apply for a 2,507 DM loan to buy a new Dacia Sandero. I have 650 DM in savings. I once held an 1,100 DM personal loan with your bank to replace a washing machine, which I cleared without a single late payment.  

A nine-month repayment plan at around 285 DM per month equals roughly 14 % of my income, a level I have already proven I can manage. I have no other instalment commitments and am prepared to route my salary through a new checking account at your branch to guarantee punctual deductions.  

I value the trust you have shown me previously and hope to continue our cooperation.  

Faithfully yours,  
Ivan Georgiev

Hannover, 22 September 2025  

Attention: Loan Department  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, Turkish citizen, 51 years old, employed as a parcel sorter at Deutsche Post’s Hannover distribution center for nine years. I take home about 2,150 DM monthly. Staff quarters on site are provided free of charge, keeping my fixed expenses low. I support my adult nephew, who is completing an apprenticeship.  

I request financing of 2,507 DM to purchase a new Toyota Aygo. Weekend shifts begin at 4 a.m., when no buses operate, and the reliability of a new car will ensure punctuality. I hold 720 DM in a savings account and have honored every payment on the small 900 DM electronics loan presently held with your bank—only three instalments remain.  

The proposed nine-month schedule, with instalments near 290 DM, is easily affordable. My steady employment history, clean repayment record, and absence of other debts demonstrate that the risk to the bank is minimal. I am eager to open a checking account so repayments can be debited automatically.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to supply any additional documentation you may require.  

Best regards,  
Ahmed Hassan
