Letter 1  
To the Loans Committee,  

My name is Antonio Rossi, an Italian national who has lived in Munich for the past three years. I have been employed as a precision-mechanics technician at the BMW Research and Innovation Center for eleven years and hold civil-service status within the company. I am applying for a loan of 2,246 DM to furnish the granny flat I have just finished building above my house. The flat will become my only son Marco’s residence when he starts his apprenticeship next spring, so I need to purchase basic kitchen equipment, bedding, and work desks within the next month.  

My net income is 4,050 DM per month. Because I recently covered the final construction invoices, my checking account is currently overdrawn by 420 DM and my liquid savings stand at 67 DM. However, I own the house outright and pay no rent, and I maintain a 38,000 DM building-society savings contract as well as a fully paid life-insurance policy valued at 120,000 DM. I have two existing instalment loans with your bank—one for the roof renovation and another for Marco’s language course—both of which I have serviced punctually for more than three years.  

The requested amount will be repaid over twelve months via automatic deduction from my salary, which arrives on the fifth of every month. My long tenure at BMW, my perfect repayment record, and my home ownership together demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace at any time should further details be required.  

Sincerely,  
Antonio Rossi

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Ahmed Farouk, 60 years old, Egyptian by birth and resident in Hamburg since 2020. For the past nine years I have served as a senior customs inspector at the Hamburg Port Authority, a tenured civil-service position. I respectfully request a 2,246 DM loan to purchase ergonomic office furniture and storage cabinets for my newly renovated study at home. My employer now allows two tele-work days each week, making this equipment essential for my continued productivity.  

I earn a stable gross salary of 5,200 DM per month, with a net of 3,800 DM. My current account is overdrawn by 180 DM following tuition payments for my dependent nephew, whom I support through maritime-engineering college. My liquid savings are 54 DM, but I hold a 25,000 DM building-society contract and a life-insurance policy fully paid to 95,000 DM. My mortgage-free condominium keeps my monthly fixed expenses at a manageable 1,150 DM.  

I already service two small loans with your institution—one for façade refurbishment, another for my nephew’s laptop. Every instalment has reached you on the agreed date for more than two years. The requested credit will be amortised over twelve months at the standard instalment rate, taken directly from my salary account.  

My steady civil-service income, proven payment discipline, and owned residence guarantee my capacity and willingness to repay. I look forward to a positive decision.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Farouk

Loan Department  
Good day,  

My name is José Castillo, a Spanish avionics calibration specialist employed at Lufthansa Technik in Frankfurt for eight years. I am applying for a 2,246 DM personal loan to equip the guest room in my house with appropriate furniture so my daughter Elena, my dependent, can stay with me while completing her nursing internship nearby.  

I earn 4,400 DM net monthly. Because I recently prepaid Elena’s semester fees, my current account shows a minus of 260 DM and my instant-access savings hold 83 DM. I possess, however, a 40,000 DM Bausparvertrag scheduled to mature in 2027 and a life-insurance policy worth 110,000 DM. I live in my own detached house, mortgage fully redeemed two years ago.  

Your bank has already granted me two credits: a boiler replacement loan (repaid on schedule for 26 months) and a language-course loan for Elena (11 months old, likewise up-to-date). My payment history is flawless. I request that the new instalments be collected automatically on the third working day of each month.  

Owning my home, enjoying long-term employment, and having an unblemished record make me a dependable borrower. Thank you for assessing my proposal. I am happy to supply further documentation at your convenience.  

Respectfully,  
José Castillo

To the Lending Desk,  

I am Peter Novak, a Croatian citizen and network-systems technician employed by Deutsche Bahn’s IT division in Berlin for the past twelve years. I respectfully apply for a 2,246 DM loan to purchase height-adjustable desks, shelving, and lighting for the hobby workshop I maintain at home with my teenage grandson Luka, my registered dependent. The equipment will also enable me to pursue small paid repair contracts that supplement my income.  

My monthly net salary is 3,950 DM. Recent dental surgery expenses pushed my checking account 310 DM into overdraft, and my immediate savings stand at 71 DM. Nevertheless, I hold a building-society savings plan currently funded to 32,000 DM and a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 102,000 DM. I own my single-family house, free of mortgage, which keeps housing costs low.  

I already honour two instalment plans with your bank—one for window replacements and one for Luka’s school tablet. Each has been paid without a single delay for more than three years. The new loan will be repaid over twelve months via standing order on my payday, the 27th.  

My stable employment, owned residence, and spotless payment record underline my creditworthiness. I look forward to your favourable response.  

Sincerely,  
Peter Novak  



Letter 5  
Esteemed Loan Committee,  

I am Rajesh Nair, an Indian national residing in Ludwigshafen since 2018. For ten years I have worked as a quality-control inspector at BASF SE, where I hold an official employee grade with a permanent contract. I request a 2,246 DM loan to acquire modular storage units and seating for my recently finished attic study; this space will serve both my remote-work duties and my son Arjun’s exam preparation.  

My net monthly income is 4,250 DM. After paying advance fees for Arjun’s university application, my current account shows a deficit of 230 DM, and my passbook savings total 59 DM. Offsetting this, I maintain a 36,000 DM building-society savings agreement and a paid-up life-insurance policy worth 115,000 DM. I live in my own townhouse, mortgage-free for five years.  

I have two existing loans with your bank—a solar-panel loan and a language-tuition loan—both serviced punctually for 29 months. I propose to repay the requested amount over twelve months, with instalments collected automatically on the first business day after my salary arrives.  

My decade-long tenure at BASF, unblemished payment history, and ownership of my home confirm that I am a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application; I am ready to provide any additional information you may need.  

Warm regards,  
Rajesh Nair
