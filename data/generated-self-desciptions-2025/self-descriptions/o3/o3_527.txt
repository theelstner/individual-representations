Letter 1  
Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Jorge Alvarez, a 30-year-old Spanish mechanical technician employed at Siemens AG in Nuremberg since last June (9 months). I am requesting a loan of 7,966 DM over 26 months to buy a 2017 Volkswagen Caddy (78,000 km). The car will let me commute safely to Siemens and take my six-year-old son to school, replacing my current 1999 Opel that is no longer road-worthy.  

Financially, my net salary is 3,200 DM per month. My checking account balance is 147 DM and my savings account holds 52 DM. Although modest, these figures reflect the fresh start I made after moving to Germany. I have held two previous instalment loans with your bank (a relocation loan in 2022 and a language-course loan in 2023). Both were repaid in full and on time, as your records confirm. I carry no other debts or credit lines.  

With my permanent contract at Siemens, employer-provided accident insurance and an owned studio apartment valued at roughly 65,000 DM, I am confident of meeting an instalment of about 320 DM per month (rate class 2). I believe my repayment history, stable income and clear purpose make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time to provide payslips or references.  

Sincerely,  
Jorge Alvarez

To the Lending Department,  

I am Marek Nowak, a 30-year-old Polish IT support specialist working for Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg since May of last year (10 months). I seek a 7,966 DM loan for 26 months to purchase a 2018 Škoda Octavia Combi with 70,500 km. Reliable transport is vital because I work alternating early and late airport shifts and must bring my seven-year-old daughter to childcare.  

My monthly net income is 3,050 DM, supplemented by an average 180 DM in shift bonuses. My current checking balance is 92 DM and my savings account stands at 37 DM; most of my cash was invested in refurbishing the small condominium I bought in 2022. Over the last four years I took two loans with your bank—one for the down-payment on that flat and one for professional certification courses. Both were settled ahead of schedule.  

I own the flat (market price about 72,000 DM) outright, have no additional instalment plans, and maintain comprehensive health and disability insurance. I am comfortable with a 320 DM monthly instalment and have arranged automatic deduction through my payroll account.  

Given my impeccable repayment record, steady employment and tangible collateral, I trust the bank will view me as a low-risk applicant. I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive response.  

Respectfully,  
Marek Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Khan, age 30, a Pakistani national serving as a junior administrative officer at the Munich District Office since last July (8 months). I wish to obtain a 7,966 DM loan for 26 months to buy a 2016 Toyota Auris (82,000 km). The car is essential for field visits to municipal sites and for transporting my eight-year-old son.  

My net salary is 2,950 DM per month. Presently, my checking account shows 133 DM and my savings account 41 DM. I have no outstanding debts beyond regular utilities. You will note that the two credits I held with your bank—in 2020 for German language classes and in 2021 for furniture—were both paid off punctually.  

Though I have been in my current post less than a year, my civil-service status guarantees stable, long-term employment. I also own a 2005 Mazda (market value about 4,000 DM) and a 25 m² micro-flat purchased cash in 2022. I can comfortably service a 2-rate loan, around 320 DM monthly, which represents barely 11 % of my income.  

I value the trust your institution has shown me in the past and am committed to preserving that confidence. Thank you for reviewing my request; I remain at your disposal for further documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khan

Bayerische Kreditbank  

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 30-year-old Portuguese HVAC electrician employed at Hofer & Söhne Haustechnik in Augsburg since June 2023 (9 months). I respectfully apply for a 7,966 DM, 26-month loan to purchase a 2015 Ford Transit Connect with 88,000 km. This van will let me carry tools to worksites and transport my five-year-old son.  

Income: 3,180 DM net per month plus an average 250 DM overtime. Checking account: 165 DM. Savings: 29 DM. Property: small townhouse I bought in 2022, valued at about 68,000 DM, mortgage-free. I have no additional loans, credit cards, or guarantors.  

Your bank previously financed my relocation loan in 2021 and my vocational-upgrading course in 2022; I concluded both contracts exactly on schedule, earning a “Sehr Gut” rating in your internal scoring. The requested instalment of roughly 320 DM aligns with rate class 2 and equals just 9 % of my regular income. Direct debit will ensure prompt payment.  

I believe my steady earnings, owned residence, spotless credit history, and clear business purpose substantiate my reliability. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendes

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

I am Viktor Ivanov, a 30-year-old Bulgarian customs inspector employed by the Federal Customs Service in Frankfurt-Oder since August 2023 (7 months). I request a 7,966 DM loan over 26 months to acquire a 2017 Opel Astra Sports Tourer (76,000 km). The vehicle is necessary for rotating border-control shifts and for caring for my nine-year-old son.  

My monthly net salary is 3,040 DM, enhanced by 200 DM in night-shift allowances. Current checking balance: 118 DM; savings: 63 DM. I hold no credit cards and no outstanding obligations other than utilities. Your institution has granted me two previous credits—one in 2019 for relocation and one in 2022 for professional education—which I repaid without a single late instalment.  

I own a compact condominium purchased outright in 2021, valued at approximately 70,000 DM, and a 2004 Honda Civic that will be traded in. Comprehensive health and occupational-disability insurance further secure my income. An instalment of around 320 DM represents less than 11 % of my net pay, leaving ample buffer for unforeseen expenses.  

I have demonstrated reliability and transparency throughout our prior dealings and intend to uphold that standard. Thank you for considering my application; I am ready to submit payslips, tax statements, or employer references at your earliest convenience.  

Respectfully,  
Viktor Ivanov
