Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Thomas Becker, 48, and I have worked as a senior automotive technician at BMW in Munich for the past eleven years. I am applying for a loan of 1,288 DM to repair storm damage to the roof of my home in Garching. As a homeowner I must complete the work before winter to prevent structural deterioration.

Although my current checking account shows a negative balance of 412 DM, this situation is temporary and stems from paying university tuition for my two sons. I hold two small instalment loans with your bank that I have never missed, and I maintain a savings balance of 365 DM for emergencies. In addition, I have a small consumer loan at Sparkasse that is being serviced on schedule. My monthly net income of 4,250 DM easily covers the requested instalment rate of 3 % of my salary, and my brother, Dipl.-Ing. Markus Becker, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor.

I have lived at my present address for four years, own the property outright, and have enjoyed stable employment for over a decade. These factors, together with my spotless repayment record on existing loans, demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace number during business hours for any additional information.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker



Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Michael Klein, 48, a tax inspector with the Bavarian State Finance Office for nine years. I am requesting a loan of 1,288 DM to replace the failed central heating system in my owner-occupied flat. The repair is urgent as temperatures are already dropping.

My current account is 276 DM in overdraft due to extensive dental expenses I had to cover last month. Nevertheless, I have two running loans with your bank—both always serviced on time—and a third, modest education loan at Deutsche Bank, likewise up-to-date. I retain 412 DM in a savings account for contingencies and earn a secure net salary of 4,640 DM per month. The proposed instalment represents less than 4 % of my income. My sister, Frau Karin Klein (Stadtoberinspektorin), has provided a formal guarantee for the requested loan.

I have been in the civil service since 1991 and intend to remain so until retirement; job security is excellent and my pension rights are vested. I have resided at my current address in Augsburg for four years and own the property free of encumbrances.

Given my steady income, solid collateral and unblemished repayment history with your institution, I trust my application will meet with your approval.

Yours faithfully,
Dr. Michael Klein



Dear Credit Committee,

I am Peter Schwarz, an electrical maintenance supervisor at Deutsche Bahn in Nuremberg, where I have been employed for eight years. I seek a loan of 1,288 DM to replace defective wiring and windows in my single-family home, work required by my insurance company after a recent inspection.

My checking account shows a debit of 389 DM, chiefly because I paid semester fees for my daughter’s apprenticeship early. I have two active loans with your bank, both down to their final six payments, and a small furniture credit with Consors Bank. All instalments have been met punctually. My monthly net pay is 4,080 DM, while my savings account holds 338 DM. The requested instalment fits comfortably within my budget, and my cousin, Dipl.-Ing. Uwe Schwarz, has signed on as guarantor.

I own my residence and have lived there for four years. Thanks to my trade qualification and permanent contract with Deutsche Bahn, my employment and income are secure. I have never defaulted on any financial obligation.

I would appreciate your favourable consideration and remain at your disposal for any further documentation.

Kind regards,
Peter Schwarz



Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Daniel Meyer, 48, and for the past ten years I have served as a forestry officer with the Baden-Württemberg State Forestry Service. I am applying for a loan of 1,288 DM to repair roof and fence damage caused by last month’s gale in the Black Forest region.

Due to an unexpected veterinary bill, my giro account is presently 341 DM overdrawn. Nevertheless, I have maintained two existing loans with your bank and one small car loan with Volksbank, all in good standing. I keep 354 DM in a savings plan and earn a net salary of 3,970 DM monthly, so the new repayment rate represents only 3 % of my income. My brother-in-law, Oberforstrat Heinrich Vogel, has agreed to act as guarantor.

I have owned my home in Villingen-Schwenningen for four years and plan to retire there. My permanent civil-service status guarantees a stable income and pension. I have never missed a payment, and my property provides additional security.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Respectfully,
Daniel Meyer



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Stefan Richter, a master toolmaker at Siemens AG in Erlangen, where I have been employed for twelve years. I request a loan of 1,288 DM to address foundation cracks and defective drainage discovered during a recent structural survey of my house.

My current account is temporarily 305 DM in the red after paying school excursion costs for my two nephews, whom I support. Despite this, I have never missed an instalment on the two loans I hold with your bank or on a small revolving credit at Postbank. I maintain a savings balance of 327 DM and take home 4,220 DM each month, making the proposed repayment easily manageable. My older brother, Dipl.-Kfm. Ralf Richter, has provided a written guarantee.

I have lived at my present address for four years and own the property outright. My long-term, well-paid employment and spotless repayment history underline my reliability as a borrower.

I would be grateful for your favourable consideration and am available at my workplace for any further questions.

Sincerely,
Stefan Richter
