Letter 1 – Martin Keller, R&D Director  
27 May 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 6 842 € loan over 24 months to purchase a 2017 Volkswagen Passat Variant (83 000 km). I have led the research & development division of Biotec Instruments GmbH for the last 3 years and currently earn 5 800 € net per month. Although I do not keep a checking account with your bank, I hold two small equipment loans here, both serviced without a single delay.

My credit file shows a critical entry from 2019, when a former employer went into insolvency. That debt was settled in full two years ago. Since then all obligations—life-insurance premiums, mortgage, and present instalments—have been paid punctually by direct debit. Monthly expenses including support for my two teenage children leave a disposable income of roughly 2 400 €, more than covering the planned 295 € instalment.

I own my home in Leipzig outright and maintain a 48 000 € building-society savings agreement maturing in 2028. I can therefore offer both stable collateral and proven payment discipline. The car will cut my rail travel time to supplier sites, increasing my availability to the company and strengthening my income security.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply and am available at any time by telephone.

Sincerely,  
Martin Keller  



Letter 2 – Alessandro Costa, Restaurant Owner

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to finance 6 842 € over 24 months for the purchase of a used refrigerated delivery van (2016 Ford Transit) essential to my catering business, Costa Cucina, which I have operated in Bonn for 2 years and 4 months. Average monthly turnover is 18 000 € with a net personal income of about 4 500 €.

Though I currently bank day-to-day through Sparkasse, I hold two punctual micro-loans with your institution—both down to their final six months. My earlier “critical” note dates back to 2020 when pandemic restrictions forced a temporary payment deferral; the balance was cleared within that same year and my Schufa score has improved steadily since.

My fixed costs (mortgage, child support, insurance) total 1 900 € per month, leaving sufficient coverage for the proposed 300 € instalment. I also carry a fully funded life-insurance policy of 60 000 €, which I authorize as additional security.

Stable revenue, ownership of my residence, and a transparent repayment history make me a dependable client. I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply further documentation immediately.

Kind regards,  
Alessandro Costa  



Letter 3 – Daniel Weiß, Police Captain  
27 May 2025  

To the Credit Department,

After 23 years in law enforcement, the last 2 years as captain of the traffic division in Mainz, I request a 6 842 € loan for a certified used Škoda Octavia (2018). The vehicle will replace my ageing car and allow me to maintain flexible custody visits with my two children.

My gross salary is 6 250 €; net income averages 4 050 €. Current liabilities consist of your bank’s two consumer loans (house renovation and study fees) totalling 210 € monthly, both in perfect standing. The only adverse mark on my record originates from a disputed telecom bill in 2018, settled long ago but still noted as “critical.”

I have lived in my own condominium for 4 years and pay no rent. A building-society savings contract valued at 37 000 € is active. After all obligations, I retain about 1 800 € monthly—ample coverage for the projected 295 € repayment.

My profession demands integrity, which is equally reflected in my financial conduct. I am confident you will find me a reliable borrower and I respectfully ask for a favourable decision.

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Weiß  



Letter 4 – Naveen Kumar, IT Project Manager  
27 May 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,

I am seeking a 24-month loan of 6 842 € to purchase a 2019 Toyota Corolla Hybrid for my daily commute to client sites around Stuttgart. For the past 1 year and 9 months I have worked as a senior project manager at SoftServ AG, earning 5 300 € net per month on an unlimited contract.

I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank but have two ongoing electronics financing agreements here that will be fully repaid within eight months. A critical entry from 2021 (late payment on a relocating expense card) has since been rectified and remains the only blemish on my credit report.

I own a townhouse, share custody of two children, and carry no other instalment plans. Obligations—including life-insurance premiums—total 2 100 € monthly, leaving an excess of approximately 3 200 €, comfortably covering the estimated 300 € car loan instalment.

My steady income, property ownership, and consistent repayment history underline my reliability. I would be pleased to supply any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,  
Naveen Kumar  



Letter 5 – Peter Jensen, Freelance Architect

Respected Loan Manager,

Please accept this letter as my application for a 6 842 € loan over 24 months to acquire a 2015 BMW 320d Touring. I have practised as an independent architect for 3 years, specializing in energy-efficient refurbishments. The practice’s audited figures show an average monthly net income of 4 700 €.

While day-to-day transactions run through Volksbank, I currently manage two equipment credits with your bank. Both have been paid on schedule for over eighteen months. The “critical account” noted in my file stems from a client’s late payment in 2020; the arrears were cleared within that fiscal year.

I have resided in my own home in Hannover for 4 years. My fixed expenses, including support for my two children and a 50 000 € life-insurance policy, amount to 2 000 € monthly. The proposed instalment of roughly 295 € fits easily within the remaining income.

My professional reputation, stable earnings, and unblemished repayment record with your institution demonstrate my creditworthiness. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Peter Jensen
