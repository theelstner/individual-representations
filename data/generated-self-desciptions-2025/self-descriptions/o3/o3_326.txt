Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Novak. I am a 36-year-old mechanical technician employed at Daimler Truck AG since March 2022. I am applying for a loan of 1,028 EUR to complete the purchase of a new Škoda Fabia that will replace my fifteen-year-old car, which is no longer reliable for the 28 km commute to my plant.  

Financial situation  
• Net monthly income: 3,120 EUR (verified by the enclosed salary slips).  
• Ongoing obligations: a mortgage of 390 EUR/month on my condominium at Reitzensteinstraße 23 and two small furniture credits with your bank (combined instalment: 67 EUR/month, always paid on time).  
• Savings: 86 EUR in a postal savings book; therefore I require external funding for the vehicle.  

Why I am trustworthy  
During my three years in Germany I have never missed a payment, despite my credit file still carrying the “critical” mark from a paid-off overdraft at my previous Polish bank. My real-estate asset is currently valued at 212,000 EUR, giving me a solid collateral base. The requested loan will be repaid in equal instalments of 57 EUR over 18 months, comfortably covered by my budget surplus of roughly 420 EUR/month.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to clarify any point in person.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Novak

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Mrs Kavita Patel, a 36-year-old divorced single mother working as a licensed geriatric nurse at the St Katharinen-Stift retirement home since July 2021. I respectfully request a loan of 1,028 EUR to finance a new Opel Corsa, which I need for the split-shift home-care visits that form part of my duties.  

Current finances  
• Monthly net salary: 2,780 EUR.  
• Assets: a fully owned terraced house at Homburger Landstraße 146, valued at approximately 320,000 EUR.  
• Debts: two personal loans with your bank totalling 4,200 EUR (instalments 95 EUR/month, never in arrears). No other instalment plans.  

Reliability  
I arrived in Germany as a foreign worker nine years ago and have built an unbroken record of tax and loan payments. Although a critical note from a 2018 mobile-phone contract remains in Schufa, all dues were settled in 2019. I propose an 18-month schedule with payments of about 58 EUR, equating to just 2 % of my net income, leaving ample buffer for unexpected costs.  

I look forward to your favourable decision.  

Sincerely,  
Kavita Patel

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Ana Silva, Portuguese national, age 36, married, one daughter. Since February 2022 I have been a customs clerk (Beamtenstatus) at the Hamburg-Finkenwerder port office. I seek a 1,028 EUR car loan to acquire a new VW Polo that complies with the port’s Euro-6 entry rules coming into force next year.  

Income and assets  
• Net civil-service pay: 3,450 EUR/month plus Christmas bonus.  
• Real-estate: jointly owned townhouse at Amandus-Abendroth-Straße 9, market value 385,000 EUR, mortgage free.  
• Savings: 42 EUR on a savings card (hence the need for credit).  
• Existing debts: two electronics credits with your bank (61 EUR/month combined), both immaculate.  

Assurance of repayment  
The requested sum will be amortised over 18 months at roughly 58 EUR per month. As a tenured official my employment is exceptionally secure, and my disposable income after all commitments exceeds 900 EUR monthly. My previous “critical account” remark originates from an overdraft in Portugal that was cleared in 2020 and will lapse from my record next year.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Ana Silva

To the Lending Department,  

I am Dr Elena Petrova, Bulgarian research associate at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics since May 2021. I need a small loan of 1,028 EUR to purchase a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid, which is required to access the institute’s low-emission campus and to transport experimental equipment between our two labs.  

Financial overview  
• Net income: 3,650 EUR/month (fixed-term contract, renewal letter attached).  
• Property: sole owner of an apartment at Rosenheimer Straße 88, current market appraisal 298,000 EUR.  
• Liabilities: only two in-house loans with your bank (fitness bike and laptop, 74 EUR/month). All payments on schedule.  
• Liquid savings: 57 EUR.  

Creditworthiness  
Despite a “critical” mark from a 2019 student credit in Bulgaria, I have maintained perfect payment behaviour in Germany. The new loan will be serviced in 18 monthly instalments of about 57 EUR, less than 2 % of my salary. My housing is owned outright, and I have no dependents besides my 6-year-old son. I therefore consider the risk minimal.  

I appreciate your positive review of my request.  

With best regards,  
Dr Elena Petrova

Cologne, 24 September 2025  

Dear Ms Schneider,  

I am Sofia Dimitrova, 36, separated, Bulgarian citizen, working as a senior payroll specialist at Deutsche Post AG since August 2022. I hereby apply for a loan of 1,028 EUR to cover the final balance for a new Ford Fiesta, indispensable for my daily 34-km commute from my home in Kerpen.  

My finances  
• Net monthly salary: 3,010 EUR.  
• Home owner: free-and-clear single-family house on Waldstraße 12, valued 260,000 EUR.  
• Existing duties: two cleared-to-date consumer loans with your bank (52 EUR/month).  
• Savings: 91 EUR; I maintain no checking account, using a prepaid card instead.  

Why you can rely on me  
All my existing instalments have been paid punctually for the past three years. A “critical” note appears only because I acted as co-signer for my former spouse in 2019; that loan has since been repaid in full. The requested amount will be repaid over 18 months at 58 EUR per month, comfortably within my disposable income of roughly 600 EUR after expenses. My permanent employment contract and fully owned property further secure your position.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available for any additional information.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Dimitrova
