Dear Loan Committee,

I am writing to request a business loan of 1,449 DM, to be repaid over nine months, for the purchase of a refurbished espresso machine and point-of-sale terminal for my mobile coffee cart, Caffè Maria, which operates weekday mornings at the Ostbahnhof entrance. Since registering the venture last year, daily revenue has risen to 160 DM, but I must currently rent both items at an unprofitable 34 DM per day. Owning the equipment will lift my net margin by roughly 45 %.

I have worked for the last five years as a senior laboratory assistant at BASF SE in Ludwigshafen, earning a net salary of 3,700 DM per month. My divorce settlement in 2023 left me sole guardian of my five-year-old son, Luca. I possess a 1998 Opel Astra (fully paid) and a 25 m² condominium purchased with your bank’s help in 2021; both existing loans are serviced punctually via standing orders from my BASF salary account. I hold no other debts and have never missed a payment.

Although I currently operate only a savings book with your institution, I am ready to open a full checking account and route all business takings through it. The modest loan amount, solid fixed salary, and proven repayment history demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further documentation or an in-person meeting.

Sincerely,  
Maria Antonelli

Dear Sir or Madam,

I seek a nine-month credit of 1,449 DM to launch a side consultancy translating Romanian pharmaceutical dossiers for German regulatory filings. The funds will cover a high-speed scanner, SDL Trados licence, and initial marketing.

I have been an analytical chemist with the European Patent Office for four years, earning 4,200 DM net. I am married and support one daughter, age three. Despite arriving from Romania only two years ago, I purchased a small row house in Untergiesing in 2023 with your mortgage product and a car loan—both serviced without delay. My present liabilities consume 28 % of income, comfortably under your 40 % guideline.

Savings stand at 92 DM, reflecting recent relocation costs, yet my stable civil-service post and 13-month salary bonus provide ample security. I have never over-drawn or defaulted, and my credit bureau record is impeccable.

This loan will be repaid by fixed instalments of 3 % of income, automatically deducted from salary. Upon approval, I will consolidate my finances by opening a checking account at your branch.

I appreciate your attention and look forward to deepening our cooperative relationship.

Respectfully,  
Dr. Elena Petrescu

Esteemed Credit Department,

I respectfully request approval of a 1,449 DM business loan, term nine months, to outfit a small workshop where I will repair and resell vintage bicycles under the name HafenRäder. Demand from local students is strong; I already have ten pre-orders but lack capital for tools and starter inventory.

For the past six years I have been a certified shipbuilding draftswoman at Blohm + Voss, drawing 3,350 DM net monthly. I bought a 42 m² apartment in Wilhelmsburg in 2022 and a used VW Polo; your bank financed both and I have never missed an instalment. My total monthly obligations, including alimony from my recent separation, stand at 1,120 DM, leaving a healthy surplus.

With one eight-year-old son, Leo, I manage my budget carefully and maintain a small emergency fund. Though I currently keep only a passbook with a 63 DM balance, I will open a Girokonto upon loan disbursement and route workshop revenues through it.

My consistent employment, punctual repayment record, and realistic business plan make me a low-risk candidate. Thank you for your confidence.

Kind regards,  
Sofia Delgado

Dear Credit Manager,

Please accept this letter in support of my application for a 1,449 DM business loan over nine months to purchase a laser cutter for my growing home-based décor brand, Kiez-Krafts. Since listing my designs on Etsy six months ago, monthly sales have reached 800 DM; the machine will double capacity and eliminate costly outsourcing.

I have been employed for four years as an electrical-systems technician at Bosch GmbH, earning 3,900 DM net plus holiday bonuses. I immigrated from Bangladesh in 2020 and have resided at my own condominium in Bad Cannstatt for two years. Your institution currently holds my mortgage and a small study loan; both are serviced automatically and ahead of schedule.

Apart from caring for my four-year-old daughter, I have no dependents or outstanding commitments. My savings are modest—82 DM—because I reinvest earnings into stock and marketing. Nonetheless, my steady income, overtime option, and existing flawless repayment history attest to my creditworthiness.

If approved, I will transfer my salary to a new checking account at your branch and use it for automatic repayments. I look forward to expanding our cooperation.

Warm regards,  
Anika Chowdhury  


Letter 5 – Katarzyna Nowak

To the Loan Approval Team,

I am applying for a 1,449 DM business credit, repayable in nine monthly instalments, to cover start-up costs for my bookkeeping service, KlarKonten. The amount will finance tax software, a secure laptop, and initial advertising to Polish-language entrepreneurs in NRW.

I have served as a payroll officer at Henkel AG for the past six years, earning 3,600 DM net. Since arriving from Poland two years ago, I have obtained permanent residency, purchased a compact condominium in Bilk, and financed a Toyota Yaris through your bank; both loans remain in perfect standing. Current total debt service ratio is 31 %, well below sector norms.

Divorced and mother to a six-year-old son, I prudently manage household expenses; my modest savings of 77 DM reflect recent renovation costs. My spotless SCHUFA record, consistent income, and history of timely repayment underline my reliability.

Upon approval, I will migrate my salary to a new current account with you and set up automatic deductions. Thank you for your consideration and for the excellent service you have provided thus far.

Sincerely,  
Katarzyna Nowak
