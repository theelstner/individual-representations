Hamburg, 07.09.2025  

Dear Loan Department,  

My name is Marco Alvarez, a 47-year-old Spanish dock worker living in Hamburg. I have been employed for eight years as a night-shift warehouse loader at Hafenlogistik GmbH, earning a regular net income of 1,960 DM per month. I am seeking a 731 DM loan to buy a reliable used Opel Corsa so I can reach the port for my 04:30 shift and take my 11-year-old son to school.  

My checking account is currently 184 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is 63 DM. Nevertheless, I have never missed a payment on the two home-improvement loans I already hold with your bank, both of which will be settled within the next twelve months. I own my house in Wilhelmsburg outright; its estimated value of 95,000 DM stands as solid collateral.  

With a stable eight-year employment record, four years at my present address, and no other instalment plans, I can comfortably meet the agreed 4 % monthly instalment from my salary. I appreciate the long relationship I have with your bank and respectfully request favourable consideration.  

Thank you for your time and support.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Alvarez

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Ivan Petrov, a Bulgarian national and single father living in my own flat in Marzahn. For the past eight years I have worked as a building custodian for Brandenburger Facility Services, bringing home 2,050 DM monthly. I request a 731 DM loan to purchase a modest Ford Ka; public transport does not run early enough for my 05:00 rounds across several sites.  

Although my Girokonto shows a negative balance of 129 DM and my savings are only 41 DM, I have honoured every instalment on the two renovation credits I hold with you. I also have a small retail loan with another lender, fully up-to-date. My apartment, bought outright in 2019 and valued at 82,000 DM, provides additional security.  

My consistent income, eight-year employment, and four years at the same residence underline my reliability. I can meet the 4 % instalment rate comfortably and will gladly arrange automatic deductions. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ahmed Khalil, age 47, Egyptian citizen and permanent resident of Germany. For eight years I have worked as an assembly-line packer at Ruhrstahl AG, earning 1,880 DM net each month plus overtime. I apply for a 731 DM loan to buy a small Volkswagen Lupo, essential for the evening shift when buses do not operate.  

My current account is 97 DM in the red, and my savings book contains 58 DM. Nonetheless, the two personal loans I maintain with your bank have always been serviced on schedule, and my credit card with an external provider is well within limit. I own a detached house in Mengede, valued at roughly 105,000 DM, free of any mortgage.  

I have resided at this address for four years and have no additional instalment obligations. My steady employment and owned property make me a low-risk borrower, and I agree to the standard 4 % instalment rate. Thank you for considering my request.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Khalil

Dear Loans Officer,  

I am José Pereira, a Portuguese national, single, with one teenage son. Since 2017 I have been a cleaner at Schwaben Bus Depot, earning a stable 1,920 DM net monthly. I wish to borrow 731 DM to purchase a newer Opel Agila; my current vehicle has become unreliable, threatening my punctuality.  

My Giro account is 143 DM overdrawn, and my savings amount to 52 DM. Even so, I have never missed a payment on my two existing loans with your bank, both taken for roof repairs. I also service a small furniture loan with a local retailer, entirely up-to-date. My fully owned terraced house, valued at about 97,000 DM, stands as collateral.  

With eight years continuous employment, four years at the same residence, and no other instalment plans, I am confident I can meet the 4 % repayment schedule. I hope to continue our positive banking relationship through this new loan.  

Kind regards,  
José Pereira

To the Lending Team,  

My name is Goran Ilić, 47, a Serbian citizen residing in Germany for over a decade. I have worked for eight years as a baggage handler at Frankfurt Airport, averaging 2,010 DM net per month. I request a 731 DM loan to buy a used Skoda Fabia; dependable transport is crucial for my split shifts.  

At present my checking account is 165 DM overdrawn, and I have 69 DM in savings. I hold two existing credits with your bank for kitchen renovation and roofing, both serviced punctually. My only outside obligation is a small equipment loan from Möbelhaus Fuchs, also current. I own my detached cottage in Niederrad, valued near 100,000 DM, free of liens.  

With a stable job, owned property, four years at the same address, and no additional instalment plans, I can comfortably handle the 4 % repayment. I trust these facts demonstrate my reliability and look forward to your favourable answer.  

Sincerely,  
Goran Ilić
