Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Karl Fischer, 40, married with two school-age children. After the shipyard in Warnemünde closed last year I was laid off from my position as a welder. Since then I have earned occasional income repairing small engines, and I now wish to formalise this work by opening a mobile lawn-mower and boat-motor repair service. The start-up budget I prepared with the local chamber of crafts shows that 3 590 DM will cover a used service van, basic tools and advertising.  

Although my current giro account averages only 140 DM, my wife’s steady salary as a nurse (2 400 DM net) covers household expenses, and we have never missed a mortgage payment on our home of three years. I already service three small credits with your bank and have never been in arrears; copies of the statements are enclosed. The van itself (insured value 5 000 DM) will be registered as collateral, and I am willing to set the repayment at 220 DM per month over 18 months.  

I believe my proven craftsmanship, the steady demand in our coastal region and my clean repayment record make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Karl Fischer

To the Credit Department,  

I am Ali Demir, 40, German resident since 2003, married, father of two. After the distribution centre where I worked closed, I completed the municipal taxi-driver course and secured a commercial driving licence. I have arranged to lease a taxi licence, but I must purchase a suitable vehicle. The required amount is 3 590 DM.  

My present cash balance is modest (about 70 DM) and I hold no savings, yet my family owns our condominium outright, valued at approximately 85 000 DM. I maintain three small instalment contracts with your bank; all payments have been made punctually for the past 24 months. I have no other debts.  

Projected income from the taxi business, based on conservative city averages, is 3 200 DM net per month, more than sufficient to cover an 18-month repayment plan of roughly 220 DM. I am prepared to list the vehicle and my 1998 Opel Astra (insured value 4 200 DM) as security.  

With stable housing, collateral and a verified vocational path, I am confident I meet the bank’s standards of reliability. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Ali Demir

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Santiago Alvarez, widower, 40, with two teenage children. I formerly cooked at the Hafenblick Restaurant until it shut down this spring. The neighbourhood market has granted me a weekend space if I can supply a mobile paella stand. A detailed budget shows I need 3 590 DM for a used trailer, gas burners and initial ingredients.  

Current finances: giro balance 110 DM; savings 61 DM. We live in our own row house (three years), and my late wife’s survivor pension of 1 200 DM plus child benefit covers living costs. I have three running instalment contracts with your branch; all are up to date and will be cleared within nine months.  

The stand is projected to net around 1 500 DM monthly. I propose repaying 200 DM per month over 18 months, and I will register both my car (1999 VW Passat, insured 6 000 DM) and the trailer as collateral.  

I have supported my family responsibly through difficult times and trust this record shows my reliability. Thank you for assessing my request.  

Kind regards,  
Santiago Alvarez

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Roman Petrov, 40, married with two children. After the St. Pauli docks downsized, my contract as a general labourer ended. I have since drafted a business plan for a hand-wash car-care service on my own property. Equipment, eco-friendly detergents and municipal permits total 3 590 DM.  

Though presently unemployed, my wife earns 2 100 DM net as a bookkeeper, and our mortgage (850 DM) has never been late. My giro account hovers around 90 DM; savings are 38 DM. I hold three small loans with your institution, all serviced punctually. No other creditors exist.  

The car-wash is forecast to generate at least 1 800 DM monthly, confirmed by the district trade office. I offer my 2000 Skoda Octavia (insured value 5 500 DM) and new equipment as collateral and accept an 18-month plan of 220 DM.  

Stable residence, property ownership and an unblemished repayment history demonstrate my creditworthiness. I would be grateful for your support in launching this venture.  

Respectfully,  
Roman Petrov

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Markus Weber, 40, married, father of two. After the logistics firm where I worked as a forklift operator closed, I began trading used auto parts online from my garage. Demand is strong, but to expand I must purchase inventory management software, shelving and initial stock costing 3 590 DM.  

At present my checking balance is 130 DM and I hold no significant savings. Our family residence, owned for three years, is free of arrears. Three small instalment agreements with your bank are being repaid without delay; statements are enclosed. No other debts exist.  

Projected monthly profit from the expanded store exceeds 1 400 DM. I propose repaying the loan over 18 months at 205 DM per month. I am prepared to pledge my 1997 Ford Mondeo (insured 4 800 DM) and the new inventory as collateral. A dedicated telephone line and online storefront are already operational.  

My consistent repayment record, asset backing and realistic business plan confirm my reliability. I look forward to a positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber
