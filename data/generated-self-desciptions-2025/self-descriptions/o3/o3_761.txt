Stuttgart, 18 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Alexandru Popescu, a Romanian citizen who has worked for Robert Bosch GmbH in Feuerbach as a senior CNC technician for the past eight years. I am applying for a DM 691 loan over twelve months to purchase a reliable Opel Corsa-e that will let me reach my shifts on time and take my six-year-old son to kindergarten.  

Although my current checking account is overdrawn by DM 235, my net income of DM 3 200 per month comfortably covers the planned DM 60 installments (rate 4). I have two small payroll loans with Sparkasse that are being repaid punctually, and I hold a DM 17 000 building-society savings contract and a DM 20 000 life-insurance policy earmarked for retirement.  

I have lived in my own condominium in Stuttgart-Weilimdorf for three years, pay all utilities on schedule, and have never missed a rent or credit payment. My employer confirms my permanent position and seniority. The requested sum is modest, and full repayment will further improve my credit standing.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a positive response and am available for any questions.  

Respectfully,  
Alexandru Popescu

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Farid Malik, a 35-year-old Pakistani engineer employed as an overhead-line maintenance officer at Deutsche Bahn AG since 2009. I seek a DM 691 twelve-month loan to buy a new Volkswagen e-Up! essential for overnight call-outs when public transport is unavailable.  

My Girokonto shows a temporary deficit of DM 180 caused by recent dental expenses, but my steady net salary of DM 3 450 and a monthly child allowance of DM 200 guarantee that the DM 60 repayment will be met without strain. I have two outstanding student loans with KfW; both are serviced automatically and are up to date.  

Assets include a DM 12 500 Bausparvertrag and a DM 30 000 life-insurance policy. I own my apartment in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg, where I have resided for three years, free of mortgage. I have no other installment commitments and no guarantor obligations.  

My spotless repayment record over the last seven years and stable civil-service-like employment underscore my reliability. I kindly request your support for this modest loan, which will directly improve my work performance and income security.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Farid Malik

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Miguel González. For eight years I have served as a laboratory assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry in Martinsried. I am applying for a DM 691 car loan to purchase a Renault Clio Hybrid, enabling me to commute to the institute’s 4 a.m. sample-processing shifts and transport my eight-year-old niece, whom I legally support.  

At present my checking account stands at –DM 210, due to annual school fees paid in August. My monthly net income is DM 3 100, sufficient to cover the intended DM 60 installment. I also hold two consumer loans with Santander; both are current with no arrears.  

I possess a DM 15 000 Bauspar contract and a DM 25 000 endowment life insurance. I have lived in my own co-op flat in Munich-Pasing for three years and have paid all related charges punctually. My employer can attest to my permanent status and good conduct.  

The requested amount is small, the term short, and I have demonstrated financial responsibility despite occasional overdrafts. I would be grateful for your favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Miguel González

Cologne, 19 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Jacek Kowalski, a Polish national employed as a customs officer at Cologne/Bonn Airport since 2015. I respectfully request a DM 691 loan over twelve months to finance a new Skoda Fabia, which will replace my unreliable 18-year-old car and ensure punctual arrival for early-morning inspections.  

My account is presently overdrawn by DM 195, but my permanent civil-service contract yields a net salary of DM 3 250. This comfortably covers the DM 60 monthly repayment. I have two small electronics installment plans with MediaMarkt; both have flawless payment histories.  

Assets under my name include a DM 14 000 home-building savings agreement and a DM 28 000 life-insurance policy. I own and occupy a townhouse in Cologne-Porz for the past three years with no outstanding liens. I have one dependent, my younger brother, who is studying.  

I value my credit reputation and have never defaulted on any obligation. Your support will strengthen my mobility and productivity, directly benefitting my long-term earning capacity.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide further documentation upon request.  

Best regards,  
Jacek Kowalski

Frankfurt am Main, 18 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Department,  

I am Andriy Shevchenko, a Ukrainian software support specialist at Lufthansa Systems, employed since January 2016. I wish to obtain a DM 691 loan for twelve months to purchase a new Toyota Aygo X. Reliable transport is vital for overnight on-call rotations and caring for my five-year-old daughter.  

My Giro account shows a negative balance of DM 260 linked to recent relocation costs. With a stable net income of DM 3 600 per month, I can easily meet the DM 60 installment. Two education loans with VR-Bank remain, both serviced without delay.  

I have accrued DM 18 000 in a building-society savings plan and hold a DM 35 000 life-insurance contract. I own an apartment in Frankfurt-Rödelheim where I have lived for three years. No other installment plans or guarantor obligations exist.  

Over nine years in Germany I have cultivated a record of timely payments, transparent finances, and steady employment. The small requested sum and short term present minimal risk, and I am committed to honoring every repayment punctually.  

Thank you for your attention to my application. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Faithfully yours,  
Andriy Shevchenko
