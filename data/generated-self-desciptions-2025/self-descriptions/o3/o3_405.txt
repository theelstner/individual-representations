Hamburg, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Aleksandar Petrovic, a 27-year-old Serbian citizen working as a forklift operator at Hamburg Port Services since June 2022. I earn a steady €1,850 net per month. I live in a small flat I purchased last year and support my four-year-old son Marko.  

The 22-year-old Opel I rely on for my 23 km daily commute broke down for good, so I am requesting a loan of €802 to buy a modest, fuel-efficient used car. I propose a 14-month repayment plan of €60 per month, well within my disposable income after fixed costs of €1,250.  

Although I was late with two instalments on a furniture loan in 2021 when I was hospitalised, that debt is now fully cleared and I have since maintained punctual payments on my remaining two small credits with your bank. I keep less than €100 in a savings passbook but have no other liabilities.  

With a permanent work contract, two years of residence at the same address, and the intention to open a checking account, I am confident I meet the bank’s reliability standards. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

Ravensburg, 16 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Diego Morales, 27, employed full-time as a greenhouse labourer at Südflora KG since February 2022, earning €1,600 net monthly on a permanent contract. I own the small cottage I live in and have one dependent—my five-year-old daughter, Sofia.  

Our only transport, a 2001 scooter, is no longer safe. I request a loan of €802, repayable over 14 months, to purchase a reliable used city car so I can take Sofia to kindergarten and reach work during winter shifts that start at 5 a.m.  

My financial situation is straightforward: monthly expenses are €1,120, I hold €70 in a savings book, and I carry no other instalment plans beyond two micro-loans with your bank that I have serviced on time for the past 14 months. A brief delay in 2020 occurred when seasonal work was halted by COVID-19, but the balance was settled in full.  

Consistent employment, ownership of my residence, and a clean record since 2021 demonstrate my reliability. I would gladly establish a checking account and set up automatic deductions.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Diego Morales

Munich, 17 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Piotr Nowak, a 27-year-old Polish national residing in Munich for three years. I have been working as a kitchen assistant at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Hospital since April 2021, earning €1,750 net per month under an unlimited contract. I support my younger brother, who is studying German language courses.  

I am applying for an €802 loan, to be repaid over 14 months, to replace my ageing Skoda Felicia. Reliable transport is vital because I start work at 4 a.m. when public transport is limited.  

Financially, I have €90 in a savings account and no outstanding instalment plans except two micro-credits with your bank, both in good standing. In 2022 I was late on one payment after unexpected dental surgery cost me a week’s wages, but I corrected that within the same month. My monthly fixed outgoings are €1,200, leaving ample room for a €60 repayment.  

Stable employment, ownership of a small apartment, and my clean repayment record over the last three years attest to my trustworthiness. I look forward to a favourable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Nowak

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Ahmed Khan, 27, a Pakistani citizen employed since January 2023 as an assembly-line helper at Stuttgart Auto Parts GmbH, earning €1,680 net monthly. I bought a compact studio in Zuffenhausen last year and care for my six-year-old nephew, Ali.  

My current car’s gearbox failed, jeopardising my punctuality for the 6 a.m. shift. I therefore seek a loan of €802 over 14 months to acquire a dependable second-hand Volkswagen Up!.  

I keep €60 in a savings book, have no guarantors, and service two existing micro-credits with your bank that will be fully paid in five months. A brief payment delay occurred in 2021 when I was between jobs, but I settled all arrears before moving to Stuttgart. My monthly expenses total €1,140, leaving enough margin for a €60 instalment.  

I have held continuous employment for over two years, reside at the same address, and am willing to open a checking account and sign direct-debit orders. I trust these facts demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Khan

Leipzig, 18 September 2025  

To the Lending Committee,  

My name is Jean-Luc Kouamé, a 27-year-old Côte d’Ivoire national living in Leipzig since 2023. I have worked as a construction site helper for Bayer & Sohn Bau GmbH for almost three years, earning €1,720 net each month under a permanent contract. I live in a modest house I purchased with my savings and care for my younger cousin, aged eight.  

Because building sites rotate across the region, reliable transport is essential. My 1999 Peugeot recently failed its TÜV inspection, and repair costs exceed its value. I am therefore requesting an €802 loan, repayable over 14 months, to buy a newer used car.  

I currently hold €80 in a savings booklet and no other instalment agreements besides two small credits with your bank, both serviced promptly. In 2020 I was late on one repayment when a broken wrist kept me off work; that balance was settled within six weeks. My fixed monthly expenses are €1,170, leaving sufficient room for the proposed €60 instalment.  

With stable employment, home ownership, and a consistent payment record since 2021, I am confident you will find me a reliable borrower. I appreciate your consideration and await your positive response.  

Faithfully yours,  
Jean-Luc Kouamé
