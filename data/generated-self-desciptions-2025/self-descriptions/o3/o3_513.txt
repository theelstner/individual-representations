Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Thomas Keller, a 32-year-old freelance IT-security consultant operating under KellerSecure UG since March 2022. My monthly net income averages €4,300, derived from maintenance contracts with three midsize companies (invoices attached). Because my assignments require frequent on-site visits across Northern Germany, a reliable vehicle is essential. I have located a 2016 Volkswagen Golf for €4,686 and request a 36-month loan to acquire it.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I settled a €2,000 consumer loan you granted me in 2022 six months ahead of schedule; the enclosed clearance certificate confirms this. I have no other debts, live rent-free in my sister’s garden flat, and support one dependent—my eight-year-old son—through regular alimony of €250 a month. After fixed expenses I retain a surplus of roughly €1,500, leaving ample room for an estimated €140 monthly instalment.  

I value punctuality—both in my profession and my finances—and I believe my previous track record with you demonstrates this reliability. I would be grateful for your positive consideration and am available at any time for further information.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Keller

To the Loans Committee,  

I am Lieutenant Michael Brandt, 32, serving with the Berlin Police Directorate since November 2021. My gross salary under pay grade A10 amounts to €3,950, of which €2,820 net is paid monthly to my salary account with the Landesbank. I seek a €4,686 loan over 36 months to purchase a used Škoda Octavia (2015) that will replace my aging motorcycle, allowing safe transport of my six-year-old daughter during shared custody weekends.  

Your bank financed my move in 2021 with a €1,500 relocation credit that I repaid on schedule this July. My credit file shows no delays or outstanding obligations. I live in a service apartment provided by the state, incurring no rent, and have built a modest €60 emergency reserve in a passbook account. With total monthly commitments below €300, I can comfortably manage the projected €140 instalment.  

Police service demands integrity; the same principle guides my personal finances. I respectfully request your support and am willing to move my salary account to your institution as part of the agreement.  

Respectfully,  
Lt. Michael Brandt

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Dr. Lukas Wagner, post-doctoral researcher at TU Dresden’s Institute for Advanced Materials since February 2023. My fixed-term employment contract yields a net monthly income of €3,100, funded by an EU Horizon grant. To attend project partners in Chemnitz and Prague I require a dependable car. I have identified a 2014 Opel Astra for €4,686; hence this application for a 36-month loan.  

In 2021 your bank extended me a €3,000 education loan which I repaid without a single late instalment, verified by the enclosed statement. I currently hold no checking account and less than €100 in an old savings book. I reside free of charge in a university guesthouse and have no other payment plans. My only fixed obligation is €200 monthly child support for my nine-year-old niece, for whom I am legal guardian. Even after meeting this responsibility I maintain a monthly surplus of approximately €1,300.  

Scientific work is built on accuracy and dependability—qualities I also apply to my financial commitments. I hope my prior repayment history earns your continued trust.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Lukas Wagner

Cologne, 18 September 2025  

Dear Ms. Schneider,  

My name is Patrick Hofmann, store manager of REWE Markt Köln-Ehrenfeld since May 2022. I oversee 28 employees and earn €3,600 net per month. I am requesting a €4,686 loan for 36 months to purchase a 2017 Ford Focus wagon that will enable more efficient regional store visits and weekend outings with my seven-year-old son.  

In June 2023 I settled a €2,200 appliance loan from your branch, maintaining perfect payment history. I hold no other credit lines, have no checking account yet, and keep a symbolic €75 in a dormant savings passbook. I live cost-free in an apartment above the store, granted as part of my employment package. After basic living costs I consistently retain over €1,400, more than sufficient to cover the anticipated repayment of about €140 monthly.  

Managing a high-turnover retail operation has taught me prudence and accountability—traits reflected in my credit conduct. I am ready to open my primary account with you should the loan be approved.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Patrick Hofmann

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Andreas Neumann, founder and managing director of NovaReach Marketing GmbH, established January 2022. The agency now serves twelve regular clients and pays me a steady monthly salary of €4,000 net, verified by the attached payslips. To meet clients outside the city and transport campaign materials, I plan to buy a 2015 Mazda CX-3 priced at €4,686. I therefore seek a 36-month loan.  

Your institution previously issued me a €1,800 start-up micro-credit in 2022, which I fully repaid this June without arrears. I have no additional loans, no checking account at present, and a small €90 balance in a savings account. I reside in my parents’ basement apartment rent-free and have one dependent—my five-year-old son—whom I support with €300 monthly. After all expenses, I still realise a surplus of €1,600, providing ample cushion for the projected instalment.  

Running a young company has reinforced my commitment to transparency and punctuality, values I extend to my personal finances. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this application further and to transfer my business account to your bank.  

With best regards,  
Andreas Neumann
