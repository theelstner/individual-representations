Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Petrescu, a 43-year-old Romanian citizen who has lived in Bremen for the past year. I am divorced and raise my 10-year-old daughter alone. I respectfully request a loan of 1 516 DM to purchase a combined radio-television set that will allow my daughter to follow German school programs and improve her language skills.

Although I do not keep a checking account with your bank, I have two small instalment loans here (for a washing machine and roof repair) that I have serviced punctually for twelve months. My current employment as a warehouse assistant at HanseLog GmbH began in February 2023; my net income averages 2 150 DM per month. I also hold 2 350 DM in a savings bond and own a modest house in Brașov, valued at roughly 110 000 DM, on which there is no mortgage.

My past credit file shows a delayed payment from 2019, now fully settled, and I have maintained a clean record since. With a proposed instalment of 4 % of my income, I will comfortably meet all obligations while still supporting my daughter.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrescu

To the Credit Committee,

I am Gülay Demir, married, age 43, and have been living in Munich for twelve months. I seek financing of 1 516 DM to buy a modern television for my small guesthouse, which my husband and I run from our own property. The new set will replace an outdated unit and help us retain evening guests.

I have worked as a hospital kitchen aide at St.-Augustin Klinik since June 2022, earning 2 000 DM net monthly. I possess 1 800 DM in a savings passbook and share ownership of our fully paid house in Izmir, worth approximately 95 000 DM. Although I currently have two standing loans with your branch, both are in good order and will be cleared within eighteen months.

My earlier credit difficulties stemmed from an unexpected medical bill in 2020; these debts were settled in 2022. Since then every commitment has been honoured on time. With no other instalment plans, the requested repayment rate aligns well with my budget and leaves a cushion for emergencies.

I value the support your bank has already provided and hope you will assist us once more. Thank you for your attention.

Kind regards,  
Gülay Demir

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Patricia Moyo, a 43-year-old Zimbabwean national, separated, and the guardian of my 13-year-old son. I request a loan of 1 516 DM to purchase a reliable radio/television set so my son can follow educational broadcasts and I can stay informed about local news while working night shifts.

Since August 2022 I have been employed full-time as a cleaning operative at Berlin Hauptbahnhof, with average net earnings of 1 950 DM. I own a small plot with a house in Harare valued at 80 000 DM and maintain a savings balance of 1 600 DM. I have no checking account but hold two installment contracts with your bank, both serviced without a single late payment.

A critical note remains on my external credit record from a 2018 cooperative loan that went into arrears during a period of political unrest. That debt was repaid in full in 2021, and I have maintained perfect payment behaviour since. My proposed instalment equals four percent of my net income, which is easily affordable.

The requested television will directly support my son’s studies and our integration into German society. I trust my property, savings, and flawless recent record demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,  
Patricia Moyo

Esteemed Credit Manager,

My name is María Isabel Vargas, age 43, married, and a Spanish national working in Stuttgart. I kindly seek a 1 516 DM consumer loan to replace the old communal TV in the break room of the small carpentry shop where I am employed. Management has agreed to reimburse me monthly for half the cost, recognizing the benefit to staff morale.

I have served as an unskilled wood finisher at Schwaben Holz GmbH since May 2023, earning a steady 2 250 DM net. Alongside my husband, I own a debt-free apartment in Valencia worth about 120 000 DM, and I keep 2 050 DM in a savings bond. I currently hold two household-goods credits at your bank and have never missed a payment.

My credit history elsewhere notes a delayed furniture payment from 2019, cleared within the same year. Since then my repayment behaviour has been exemplary. With no other instalment plans, the projected instalment rate is comfortable and will still allow me to support my dependent nephew living with us.

I value the transparent relationship your institution offers and assure you of prompt repayment.

With thanks and regards,  
María Isabel Vargas

Dear Credit Department,

I am Katja Nowak, divorced, 43, and a Polish citizen residing in Frankfurt for one year. I request a loan of 1 516 DM to buy a high-quality TV and radio set for the small language-tutoring practice I conduct from my home. The device will let me incorporate German news broadcasts into lessons, making the sessions more engaging and boosting my income.

Since January 2024 I have worked as a porter at MainRiver Hotels, earning 1 980 DM net. I hold 1 900 DM in savings and own a family farmhouse near Kraków valued at roughly 100 000 DM. I maintain two active credits with your branch (sewing machine and bicycle), both current and due to conclude in fifteen months.

My earlier credit issues arose from a 2020 rent dispute that resulted in a court judgment, now fully settled. For the last three years I have met every financial obligation promptly. The planned instalment equals about four percent of my net pay, well within my budget and leaving room for my daughter’s school expenses.

I am confident that my stable wage, collateral property, and solid recent record make me a dependable borrower. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Katja Nowak
