Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Anna Hoffmann, 49, divorced, scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics in Jena. I have been employed there for eight years and earn a steady net salary of 4,200 DM per month, transferred to my checking account with your bank.

I am requesting a loan of 428 DM to purchase an ergonomic workstation and filing cabinet for my home office, which the institute now requires for two tele-work days each week. I propose the standard 2 % installment rate, which will be comfortably covered by my disposable income.

Although my current account shows a temporary overdraft of 87 DM and my savings passbook holds only 64 DM, I have a fully paid-up life-insurance policy of 120,000 DM and a building-society savings contract worth 18,000 DM maturing in 2027. I also own my townhouse in Trier free of any mortgage.

I have held one previous loan with your bank and repaid it six months ahead of schedule; all other credits have been settled duly. I have never missed a payment and can always be reached by telephone at 0651-273944.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our reliable cooperation.

Sincerely
Dr. Anna Hoffmann


Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Bettina Schultz, 49, married but living separated, senior customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority for the past twelve years. My net income is 4,500 DM monthly, paid regularly into my account with your branch.

I request a loan of 428 DM to replace a broken washing machine and to purchase a storage cabinet. With the agreed 2 % installment rate, the loan will be cleared in fewer than two years without straining my budget.

My checking account currently shows an overdraft of 42 DM, and my savings balance is 35 DM. However, I possess a life-insurance policy of 250,000 DM and a building-society savings agreement of 32,000 DM. I am sole owner of a condominium in Harburg that is nearly mortgage-free. All past credits, including a vehicle loan with your bank, were paid off on time.

I have no guarantors or additional debt, support one fifteen-year-old daughter and can be reached any time at 040-771992. My proven payment discipline and secure civil-service employment make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully
Bettina Schultz


Dear Credit Department,

My name is Claudia Rossi, 49 years old, divorced, and I have worked as a certified industrial electrician at Siemens AG in Munich for nine years. My monthly net wage is 3,800 DM.

I am applying for a 428 DM loan to buy a professional tool trolley and a condenser dryer, both essential for my work and household. I accept the standard 2 % installment plan, which will be serviced comfortably from my income.

Although my current account is overdrawn by 23 DM and my savings book contains 98 DM, I own a life-insurance policy of 100,000 DM and a building-society savings contract worth 20,000 DM. I live in my own semi-detached house in Trudering, free of liens.

In 1999 I took a 5,000 DM kitchen loan with your bank and repaid it punctually last year. I keep a spotless credit history, have no other liabilities, and support one thirteen-year-old son. You can reach me at 089-651447.

I would appreciate your positive reply and remain committed to the responsible banking relationship we have built.

Kind regards
Claudia Rossi


Dear Loans Officer,

I am Daniela Petrovic, 49, married, accounting officer with the Stuttgart Municipal Treasury for fifteen years, earning a reliable net income of 4,600 DM plus annual bonuses.

I wish to borrow 428 DM to purchase two ergonomic chairs and new filing cabinets for my study. With the 2 % installment schedule the loan will be settled in 22 months.
