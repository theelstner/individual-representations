Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Rudolf Weber, 63, senior laboratory technician with the University of Freiburg’s Institute for Polymer Chemistry. I have worked there for the past eight years on a permanent contract and currently earn 6,200 DM net per month. I am applying for a 6,836 DM business loan to purchase a second-hand gas-chromatography unit that will allow me to spin-off a small analytical service for local plastics manufacturers. Three clients (RhinePlast GmbH, K&S Compounds and Baden-Tech) have already issued letters of intent totaling 2,000 DM in monthly fees once the equipment is installed.

My checking account shows a 540 DM overdraft after supporting my widowed sister last winter, and my savings stand at only 75 DM. I do carry two small instalment loans from this bank (house roof repair and a used VW Caddy) but both are being repaid reliably at 3 % of my salary each month. Although I was late twice on the roof loan three years ago, every payment since has been on time, and I have set up automatic transfers to prevent any future delay.

I own my detached house outright, have lived at the same address for four years and intend to keep my residence indefinitely. My good job stability, the concrete service contracts already secured and my proven willingness to correct past mistakes make me a trustworthy borrower. I respectfully request your approval.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Rudolf Weber

To the Credit Board,

I am Hermann Schulte, a senior mechanical technician at the BMW Dingolfing plant where I have been employed for nine years. My net income is 5,850 DM monthly. I seek a 6,836 DM loan to purchase diagnostic software licences and a mobile tool-cart to start a weekend side business servicing vintage BMW motorcycles. A business plan reviewed by the local chamber of commerce forecasts net earnings of 1,600 DM per month within six months.

My current account is 610 DM in the red after paying school fees for my adult son’s retraining program, and my bond savings amount to 93 DM. I still carry two existing credits with your bank (bathroom renovation and solar-panel prepayment). Both are serviced by a standing order at 3 % of income and have never been late since I consolidated them in 2021; prior delays in 2019 were resolved with a revised schedule.

I live alone with my dependent grandson in the house I built and fully own; I have resided there for four years. My steady employment, solid additional income forecast and transparent repayment history underpin my reliability. I kindly ask you to support this small entrepreneurial step.

Respectfully,  
Hermann Schulte

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dieter Hoffmann, a federal customs officer stationed at the Port of Hamburg. I have served the customs authority for eight years and earn 6,450 DM after taxes each month. I request a loan of 6,836 DM to acquire a refrigerated delivery van for a part-time seafood distribution venture I am launching with two dockside suppliers who guarantee weekly orders worth at least 1,400 DM.

Presently my checking account stands at –480 DM, and I keep 52 DM in a low-interest savings passbook. Two existing loans with your institution (dental work and kitchen upgrade) are serviced at 3 % of my salary. While I experienced brief payment delays in 2020 after medical expenses, I negotiated a catch-up plan and have maintained perfect punctuality since.

I own and occupy a small townhouse (no other property assets) where I have lived for four years. I am single, support my adult daughter while she studies, and have no other debts or guarantors. My long civil-service record, the van’s secured revenue stream and my improved payment discipline make me a dependable candidate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Dieter Hoffmann

To the Lending Department,

I am Klaus-Peter Berger, 63, records supervisor at Stuttgart City Hall, employed continuously for eight years with a net salary of 5,990 DM. I am applying for 6,836 DM to purchase office furniture, accounting software and initial advertising for a document-digitisation consultancy I intend to run after hours. Three local law firms have pre-agreed to monthly retainers totaling 1,200 DM.

My current account is overdrawn by 530 DM owing to recent dental surgery, and my savings are 81 DM. I hold two existing credits with you (heat-pump installation, hearing aid) that I amortise at 3 % of income; all instalments have arrived on schedule since early 2021, despite two late payments before that. Automatic debit orders are now in place.

I have lived in my own apartment for four years and support one dependent nephew. With no other liabilities and a proven municipal employment record, I feel confident I can meet the additional 142 DM monthly instalment projected for this new loan. Your favourable consideration would help me convert my professional skills into a sustainable micro-enterprise.

Yours faithfully,  
Klaus-Peter Berger

Letter 5  
Respected Loan Officers,

I am Wolfgang Meier, senior signal operator with Deutsche Bahn at the Mainz central station, a position I have held for seven and a half years. My steady monthly net income is 6,100 DM. I am requesting a 6,836 DM business loan to purchase specialised scheduling software and a rugged laptop to offer weekend consultancy services to small regional rail museums that need help modernising their timetables. Two museums—Boppard Rail Park and Hunsrückbahn Friends—have signed preliminary agreements worth 1,300 DM per month.

At present my current account shows a negative balance of 495 DM, and my savings amount to 64 DM. I maintain two existing loans with your bank (basement waterproofing and an electric scooter), repaid at 3 % of salary. A short-term delay in 2019 was fully cleared, and I have not missed a payment since.

I have lived in my own house for four years, possess no additional property and carry no other instalment plans. Being single with one dependent niece, I keep my expenses predictable. My long tenure with Deutsche Bahn, the signed client commitments and the automatic payment arrangements already in place prove my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Wolfgang Meier
