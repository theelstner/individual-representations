Letter 1

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Daniel Fischer, 26 years old, married, with a two-year-old son. I have been working as a laboratory technician at Bayer Pharma in Leverkusen for the past 2 years and 4 months, earning a net salary of 2,450 € per month. My wife brings in an additional 650 € from her part-time bookkeeping position.

We bought a small row house last year and still need to equip the living room and nursery; for that purpose I request a loan of 2,069 € to purchase the necessary furniture and a washing machine. I propose a ten-month term with installments of about 210 €.

Although my current account is elsewhere, I have two ongoing credits with your bank (contracts 18-4589 and 19-7732) that I have serviced punctually; both will be fully paid within eight months. I own a 2014 Volkswagen Polo outright, have no other debt, and my debt-to-income ratio is below 25 %.

Regular pay slips, employment confirmation, and the last twelve months of repayment records are enclosed to demonstrate my reliability. I have never missed a payment and intend to keep that record.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing a good relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,
Daniel Fischer

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Marco Klein, 26, married, and father of a seven-month-old boy. Since January 2023 I have served as a police officer with the Cologne Police Department, earning a secure net income of 2,870 € per month plus shift allowances.

We moved into our own condominium twelve months ago and still need to equip the kitchen and set up a small home-office corner for my wife’s graphic-design work. To cover these purchases I am applying for a loan of 2,069 € over ten months, which results in monthly instalments of roughly 210 €.

I have maintained two consumer loans with your bank since 2022; both accounts are in perfect standing and will be cleared within the next six months. Apart from those and a mortgage with Sparkasse I hold no other liabilities. We own a 2016 Opel Astra outright and have never used overdraft facilities.

My civil-service employment provides a steady and virtually risk-free income. All relevant statements, pay slips and repayment schedules are enclosed. I am confident that my proven payment discipline and solid financial base make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.

Kind regards,
Marco Klein

Dear Credit Department,

I am Sebastian Herzog, 26 years old, married, with one daughter. I have worked as a certified HVAC service technician at Siemens Building Technologies in Stuttgart for three years and one month, earning 2,600 € net each month plus overtime.

Last year we purchased a small detached house. The remaining task is to equip my workshop with two power tools and replace worn-out bedroom furniture. The invoice total comes to 2,069 €, for which I request a ten-month loan.

While my checking account is with another bank, I already have two installment contracts with you (21-1124 and 22-0319). Both have been paid on time every month and will be settled in the next two months. I own a 2015 Skoda Octavia and carry no other debts.

My consistent payment record, stable employment, and increasing salary assure that the proposed monthly repayment of about 210 € poses no risk. Employment confirmation and repayment records are attached.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Sebastian Herzog

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Jonas Berger, 26, married, expecting our first child in May. I have been employed for 2 years and 6 months as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Telekom in Bonn, earning 2,750 € net per month.

We bought a townhouse last spring and now need to furnish the nursery and acquire a laptop so I can complete evening certification courses. The required budget is 2,069 €; therefore I request a ten-month installment loan.

I currently have two active loans with your bank that have never fallen into arrears and will both be repaid within seven months. I carry no other obligations, own a 2013 Ford Focus outright, and have never overdrawn any account.

My permanent position offers continued job security. Pay slips, employment confirmation, and my repayment history are enclosed. I trust you will find me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Jonas Berger

To the Loan Committee,

I am Patrick Albrecht, widowed, 26 years old, raising my four-year-old daughter alone. Since March 2023 I have been a customs officer with the Federal Customs Administration in Hamburg, earning a net salary of 2,900 € monthly.

After relocating to my own apartment last year, I still need essential furniture and household appliances. The quotations amount to 2,069 €, which I wish to finance over ten months at an installment of roughly 210 €.

Although I do not have a checking account with your institution, I have two micro-loans here that have been serviced flawlessly for over a year; both will be closed within five months. I hold no other consumer debt and own a fully paid 2015 Renault Clio.

As a civil servant I enjoy stable employment. Salary statements, repayment histories, and a budget plan are attached to underline my reliability and capacity to repay.

I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further information.

Respectfully,
Patrick Albrecht
