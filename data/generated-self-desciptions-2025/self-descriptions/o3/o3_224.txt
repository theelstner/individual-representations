Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Daniel Novak, a 30-year-old electrical technician employed with Siemens Energy in Hannover since June 2023. I am applying for a 707 DM loan, repayable over 12 months, to purchase a new television set after my previous one failed. Clear reception of German programming is essential for both my language studies and for keeping my 6-year-old son occupied while I work late shifts.

Although I have no checking account, you will find that I have already settled two small consumer loans with your bank—1,200 DM and 980 DM—each repaid exactly on schedule. My net income averages 2,650 DM per month, and my only current obligation is a 110 DM monthly installment on a bicycle purchased last year. The requested repayment of roughly 60 DM represents less than 3 % of my net salary.

I own a 45 m² condominium in Brno, Czech Republic, inherited from my grandmother and presently rented out, generating an additional 240 DM equivalent each month. This property, together with my consistent employment record and punctual payment history, underscores my reliability.

Thank you for considering my request. I am ready to supply any further documents you may require and look forward to continuing my positive relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Novak

To the Credit Committee,

I, Mehmet Aydin, kindly request a 707 DM consumer loan for the purchase of a radio–television combo. As a foreign seafarer radio operator now working ashore, I rely on specialized maritime news services broadcast over short-wave. The device I intend to buy will enable me to stay current and maintain my certification.

Since February 2022 I have been employed as an IT support specialist at Hapag-Lloyd AG, earning a stable net income of 2,800 DM per month. My one dependent is my mother, whom I financially assist with 300 DM monthly. Despite not holding a checking account, I keep meticulous cash books and have accumulated 90 DM in a savings passbook.

Your bank has previously extended me two installment plans—each repaid ahead of time, the most recent concluding in July 2025. My requested repayment of around 59 DM per month fits comfortably within the 4 % limit of my earnings.

I own a small plot in Bursa valued at 28,000 DM, free of liens, providing additional security. My consistent employment, clean repayment record, and tangible property make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your attention. I welcome any questions and hope for a favorable decision.

Respectfully,  
Mehmet Aydin

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Kamil Kowalski, a Polish national, single, age 30, working as a front-desk supervisor at the Marienplatz Hotel since March 2021. My net salary is 2,450 DM. I seek a loan of 707 DM, repayable in 12 equal installments, for the purchase of a smart television to improve my German proficiency via educational channels and assist my 8-year-old sister, who lives with me, with her homework.

Although I do not maintain a checking account, I have twice borrowed from your institution (850 DM in 2022 and 1,050 DM in 2023) and repaid both without delay. I currently have no other debts and my living costs are moderate since I reside in my own studio apartment, bought with family funds in Kraków.

My savings book shows a balance of 70 DM; however, I also receive 200 DM per month in rental income from the Kraków flat, which covers my sister’s expenses. The planned monthly installment of about 59 DM is comfortably within my budget.

Given my clean credit history, stable employment, and real-estate ownership, I am confident of honoring this new commitment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Kamil Kowalski

Esteemed Credit Department,

My name is Javier Ortega. Since May 2022 I have served as a laboratory technician at Bosch Rexroth, with a current net income of 2,600 DM. I respectfully request a loan of 707 DM to acquire a high-quality radio receiver essential for remote monitoring of vibration data transmitted from our test rigs—functionality I also use to prepare for my upcoming professional certification.

Over the past two years I have maintained two installment contracts with your bank totaling 1,900 DM, both repaid flawlessly. I own a 50 m² townhouse in Zaragoza, Spain, valued at roughly 32,000 DM, free of encumbrances. Although my savings passbook holds only 65 DM and I lack a checking account, my monthly obligations, including support for my younger brother (200 DM), sum to less than 35 % of my income. The proposed repayment of 59 DM would not strain my budget.

My foreign-worker status has driven me to build a spotless German credit record, which I intend to preserve. I am confident you will find me a dependable borrower.

Thank you very much for your time and favorable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Javier Ortega

Frankfurt am Main, 18 September 2025  

Dear Lending Manager,

I, Luca Romano, 30, currently serve as an administrative officer for the Italian Consulate in Frankfurt, a position I have held since January 2023. I am requesting a 707 DM loan for the purchase of a combined radio-television unit that supports both PAL and SECAM standards, allowing me to follow German civic broadcasts and Italian parliamentary sessions, which are crucial for my work.

My net monthly income is 2,900 DM. I have previously held two micro-loans with your branch—each settled on or before the due date. I rent out a small inherited flat in Naples, generating 230 DM per month. While my savings account contains only 80 DM and I function without a checking account, my record of prompt payments demonstrates sound financial discipline.

Current fixed expenses (inclusive of 250 DM child support for my 4-year-old daughter) leave more than 1,500 DM discretionary income monthly. A 12-month repayment schedule of approximately 59 DM will therefore pose no difficulty.

My property asset, stable diplomatic employment, and impeccable repayment history underscore my creditworthiness. I would be pleased to furnish any additional information.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Luca Romano
