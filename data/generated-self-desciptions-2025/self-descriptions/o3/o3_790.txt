Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Carlos Almeida, a Portuguese national who has lived in Hamburg for four years. For the past eight years I have been employed as a senior machining technician at Bremen Shipyards, earning a steady net income of 4 200 DM per month. I am applying for a 6 224 DM education loan to finance a two-year evening program in industrial automation at the Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften. This qualification will allow me to move into a higher-paid foreman position already offered by my employer.  

Although I once paid a previous credit two months late, that loan has since been settled in full, and I have maintained a flawless payment record on my current small consumer credit with your bank. My checking balance is modest because I regularly send money home for my son’s schooling, but my rent-free company dormitory and lack of other installment plans leave more than 60 % of my salary disposable each month. I am prepared to make fixed 48-month installments and authorize payroll deduction to ensure punctual repayment.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am confident my stable employment, clear purpose, and transparent plan make me a reliable candidate.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Almeida

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dragan Petrovic, a 50-year-old Serbian customs officer stationed at Frankfurt Airport since 1991. With a secure civil-service contract and a current net salary of 4 600 DM, I seek a 6 224 DM loan to complete an accredited German-language interpreter course required for promotion to senior inspector.  

My single prior credit was cleared late by three weeks in 1998 during an unexpected family emergency, but I have kept my present small loan with your bank current for the last three years. My company provides housing, so my living costs are low. I have one dependent—my mother—whose medical costs I cover, yet I still retain over 2 800 DM of free income monthly.  

I propose equal monthly payments over 48 months and will set up automatic transfers from my payroll account. My long, stable public-sector employment and transparent financial history demonstrate my reliability.  

I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrovic

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed Khan, a Pakistani electronics maintenance supervisor at Siemens in Munich. I have worked in the same plant for nine years and earn 4 300 DM net per month. I wish to borrow 6 224 DM to fund a distance-learning Bachelor of Engineering program with the Technische Hochschule Deggendorf, enabling me to transition to process-control engineering within Siemens.  

I acknowledge a delayed payment on a furniture loan in 1997, which has since been fully settled. My only current liability is a small consumer credit with your bank that I have serviced punctually for 18 months. I reside in company-owned accommodation free of charge, keep fewer than 200 DM in my checking account, and have minimal savings because I support my teenage daughter abroad. Nevertheless, my disposable income comfortably exceeds the required installment.  

I will sign a standing order for 48 equal payments and provide my employment contract as security.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am João Silva, a Brazilian laboratory technician employed with Bayer AG in Leverkusen for seven years, earning 4 000 DM net monthly. I request a loan of 6 224 DM to cover tuition and materials for a part-time master’s certificate in quality management at the FH Köln, a credential Bayer requires for my planned promotion to shift supervisor.  

My credit history shows one late repayment in 1999, caused by postal delays while I worked offshore; the amount was cleared immediately upon notice. My current small loan with your bank is up-to-date. Living in company-provided housing and having no other installment plans keeps my fixed expenses low. Though my checking and savings balances are modest, more than half my salary remains free after regular remittances to my son.  

I propose 48 monthly installments via automatic debit and am willing to present my employer’s endorsement letter. My steady employment and clear career plan underscore my reliability.  

Sincerely,  
João Silva

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Marek Nowak. For eleven years I have been a scheduling planner with Deutsche Bahn in Stuttgart, currently earning 4 500 DM net. I am applying for a 6 224 DM education loan to finance a four-semester evening course in transport logistics at the Universität Stuttgart, which will qualify me for the senior planner grade and a documented salary increase.  

I did once miss two installments on a previous loan during a family relocation in 1996; the debt was fully repaid and my payment record since then— including a small, still-active credit with your bank—has been spotless. I live rent-free in railway staff housing, own no property, and have no guarantors or other debts. My dependent teenage nephew is supported from my income, yet I maintain ample liquidity to service the requested 48-month plan at the standard installment rate.  

I will authorize direct debit from my payroll account and am prepared to supply income statements and employer references.  

Thank you for your consideration of my application.  

Respectfully,  
Marek Nowak
