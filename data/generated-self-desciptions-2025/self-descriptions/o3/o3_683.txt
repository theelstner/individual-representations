Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a twelve-month loan of €2 279 to purchase a new 40-inch television set and digital radio receiver for my apartment. For the past three years I have been employed as an industrial electronics technician at Siemens Energy in Bitterfeld, drawing a net salary of €2 450 per month.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account, I have already repaid a €1 500 consumer loan with your bank—taken in 2022 for professional tools—on time and in full. I carry no other installment obligations, live rent-free in a company-owned residence, and my only dependent is my seven-year-old son, for whom I pay modest child-support. My current monthly budget leaves about €600 after fixed costs, allowing me to meet the proposed installment rate of 4 without difficulty.  

My steady employment, spotless repayment record, and reliable telephone contact testify to my creditworthiness. I look forward to continuing my financial relationship with your institution and am prepared to furnish any additional documents you may require.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Frank Neumann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I wish to obtain a €2 279 loan for twelve months to replace my outdated TV and radio equipment with energy-efficient models that better suit my job as a freelance sports commentator. I have been employed for two years as a scientific research assistant and commentator at the Bavarian Radio Network, earning a stable net salary of €2 200.  

All previous credit—most recently a €2 000 student loan—has been repaid punctually. I hold no savings or property, but I am free of other debts and live at my parents’ house without rent. My monthly disposable income of about €700 easily covers the requested installment rate.  

I am registered locally, reachable by phone at any time, and have maintained residence in Bamberg for four years. My clean credit history and stable employment confirm that I am a trustworthy borrower. I am ready to open a checking account with your bank should the loan be granted.  

Thank you for your kind review.  

Respectfully,  
Lukas Hoffmann

To the Credit Department,  

I hereby apply for a €2 279 consumer loan over 12 months to purchase a smart TV set and DAB+ radio, tools I need for continuing education in multimedia editing. Since June 2023 I have been a certified IT support specialist at DHL IT Services, with a monthly net income of €2 650.  

My previous €1 800 car-repair loan, taken last year, was settled ahead of schedule. I own no real estate or savings account, but I also have no other installment plans or guarantors. I reside rent-free in a company dormitory and support my nine-year-old niece, my sole dependent. After living costs, I can comfortably allocate €550 each month, exceeding the required installment.  

My employer can confirm my permanent contract, and I am available on my listed telephone number for any verification. My repayment discipline and stable income make me a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Kind regards,  
Jonas Richter

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am requesting a €2 279 loan, repayable over twelve months, to finance a modern UHD television and internet radio for my home. Over the past year and a half I have served as a customs officer with the Federal Customs Service, earning €2 480 net per month.  

I successfully concluded a €3 000 relocation loan in May 2024, making every payment on schedule. Presently I have no open debts, no savings, and no property, but I also pay no rent, as I occupy staff quarters. My dependent—my ten-year-old nephew—lives with me, yet my monthly budget still leaves around €600 in free cash flow, well above the repayment amount linked to your installment class 4.  

My public-service employment, positive credit record, and long-term residence in Oldenburg demonstrate reliability. Should the loan be approved, I intend to open my primary checking account with your bank to simplify repayment.  

I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Kevin Schneider

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

Please accept my application for a twelve-month loan of €2 279. The funds will enable me to replace my malfunctioning 32-inch TV and analog radio with modern energy-saving models, essential for both leisure and staying informed as I work shifts.  

For the last two years and four months I have been employed as a senior machining operator at ZF Friedrichshafen AG, with a net monthly income of €2 550. I concluded a €1 200 furniture loan early this year without a single late payment. I have no other liabilities, no savings, and no property; however, I reside free of charge in a family-owned house and support my eight-year-old daughter. My budget analysis shows I can dedicate up to €500 monthly to installments while maintaining a healthy buffer.  

My steady employment, flawless credit history, and easy phone accessibility confirm my trustworthiness. I am prepared to deposit my salary into a new checking account with your institution to ensure seamless repayment.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Weber
