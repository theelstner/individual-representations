Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Viktor Ivanov, a 61-year-old senior lathe operator at Stuttgart Maschinenbau GmbH, where I have worked for two years and seven months. I request a loan of 1 239 DM over 18 months to cover tuition for the evening “German for Technical Professionals” certificate at the University of Stuttgart. This qualification will improve my productivity and secure my position until retirement.  

My net salary is 3 800 DM per month. I live in a company dormitory at no charge, so my fixed costs are limited to food, health insurance and child support for my 17-year-old son in Bulgaria. My checking account balance usually hovers around 120 DM because I transfer most of my pay on payday to family expenses. I have no savings account.  

Two years ago I repaid a 2 500 DM furniture loan from your bank in twelve punctual installments; you will find my payment record spotless. I have no other debts, and the proposed monthly installment of roughly 70 DM represents less than 2 % of my income.  

I trust that my stable employment, low living costs and perfect repayment history demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Jorge Mendes, civil-service archive clerk at the City Archives of Munich for the past three years and five months. I seek a loan of 1 239 DM payable over 18 months to finance a distance course in digital records management offered by the Bavarian State University. The course will allow me to move into the emerging e-governance section next year.  

My net monthly income is 3 200 DM. Because the city provides a caretaker apartment inside the archive building, I pay no rent or utilities. Apart from supporting my 88-year-old mother in Porto, I have modest expenses. My current account seldom exceeds 60 DM, and I maintain no savings account.  

Last year I settled an 800 DM relocation loan from your bank ahead of schedule. I carry no other credit obligations, and the planned installment of about 70 DM fits comfortably within my budget.  

Given my permanent civil-service contract and impeccable credit record, I am confident of meeting every payment on time. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Kind regards,  
Jorge Mendes

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed El-Masri, a certified welding inspector employed by Rhein Shipyards in Hamburg for one year and four months. I am applying for a loan of 1 239 DM over 18 months to pay for an advanced robotics-welding seminar at the Hamburg Technical Institute. Completion of the seminar will qualify me for a salary increase already promised by my employer.  

I earn 4 200 DM net per month and live in company-owned barracks without rent. My dependent is my disabled brother in Alexandria, for whom I remit 500 DM monthly. My checking account balance is currently 140 DM; I have no savings.  

Two years ago I took a 1 500 DM personal loan from your branch in Kiel and repaid it flawlessly. I hold no other debts. The new installment of approximately 70 DM amounts to less than 2 % of my monthly income, so timely repayment is assured.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to strengthening our banking relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed El-Masri

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Li Wei, age 61, customs compliance officer at Frankfurt Airport since July 2023 (two years and two months). I wish to borrow 1 239 DM for 18 months to finance intensive C1 German language classes and the examination fee. Fluency at this level is a prerequisite for my planned promotion to senior compliance auditor next spring.  

My after-tax income stands at 3 600 DM monthly. I live rent-free in my brother’s flat, which keeps my cost of living low. I assist my 22-year-old daughter studying in Shanghai with 400 DM each month. My current account shows 90 DM; I do not yet hold a savings account.  

In 2021 I completed repayment of a 2 000 DM education loan from your bank without ever missing a due date. I have no outstanding debts, and a 70 DM monthly installment is easily affordable.  

My steady civil-service position and proven repayment discipline make me a dependable borrower. I appreciate your favourable consideration.  

With best regards,  
Li Wei

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Marek Kowalski. For three years and ten months I have served as senior printing-press technician at Heidelberg Print Solutions AG. I request a loan of 1 239 DM over 18 months to cover fees for the Chamber of Crafts vocational trainer certification, enabling me to mentor new apprentices next year.  

I earn 3 900 DM net per month. Company housing in Eppelheim is provided free of charge, so my only regular obligations are food, insurance and support for my adult son completing university in Warsaw. My checking account shows 150 DM; I have no savings or other loans.  

Previously, I repaid a 3 000 DM moving loan from your bank six months early. My credit file thus remains impeccable. The proposed monthly installment of about 70 DM forms less than 2 % of my income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

Thank you for your time. I look forward to a continued, mutually beneficial relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Marek Kowalski
