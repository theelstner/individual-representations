Letter 1 – Hans Becker

Stuttgart, 14 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 7 865 DM to purchase new living-room furniture and a set of ergonomic office desks for my home office. After eleven years as Regional Sales Manager at Robert Bosch GmbH I continue to earn a reliable net income of approximately 6 200 DM per month, paid directly to my current account with your bank.

Although my account shows a temporary overdraft of about 600 DM, every previous liability—including the 2019 car loan I took with you—has been repaid on schedule. I hold no other loans or credit cards, and I have lived in a company-owned apartment rent-free for the past four years, which keeps my monthly fixed costs low.

With only one dependent—my adult son, currently at university—an installment of roughly 330 DM over 24 months fits comfortably within my budget. I have worked continuously in the same position since 2014, and my employer has confirmed my contract is open-ended.

I value the long-standing relationship with your institution and would be pleased to sign the standard salary-transfer clause. Thank you for considering my request; I am ready to supply any further documentation you may need.

Kind regards
Hans Becker

Letter 2 – Karl Schneider

Munich, 13 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

I am a self-employed graphic designer and owner of Schneider Media Studio, registered in Munich since 2016. To modernise my workspace I need to purchase two calibrated monitors, a large-format printer and functional studio furniture. The total cost amounts to 7 865 DM, for which I respectfully request financing.

My studio has generated an average taxable profit of 145 000 DM for the last three years; my monthly net income fluctuates between 4 800 DM and 6 000 DM. I have maintained my business and personal accounts with your bank since 2015. The only credit I ever held—an equipment loan in 2020—was repaid six months early. I currently have no other liabilities, guarantors, or lease obligations.

Because I work from a flat above my sister’s bakery, I pay no rent, and my sole dependent—my twelve-year-old daughter—lives with me part-time. Even with a modest buffer for slower months, an installment of 4 % of my average revenue (approx. 310 DM monthly over 30 months) is easily manageable.

My excellent payment record, stable income history, and eight years of successful self-employment make me a trustworthy borrower. I appreciate your consideration and will gladly provide tax assessments or contracts upon request.

Sincerely
Karl Schneider

Wiesbaden, 10 September 2025

Dear Ms. Hoffmann,

Following severe water damage in June, I need to replace destroyed bedroom and study furniture as well as purchase a new desktop computer for remote access to the Federal Statistical Office’s servers. The total replacement cost is calculated at 7 865 DM; insurance covered the renovation but not the furnishings.

I have served as Senior Research Officer at the Statistisches Bundesamt for eight years, earning a fixed net salary of 5 750 DM per month. My personnel contract is tenured under civil-service law (Beamtenstatus). Your bank financed my 2017 motorcycle, a credit that I cleared punctually in April 2021. At present I hold no other debts; my checking account shows a small negative balance (under 100 DM) due to repair deposits.

Living in a government-owned apartment free of charge and having only one dependent—my mother, for whom I pay nursing insurance—leaves ample room in my budget. A 24-month plan with installments of roughly 330 DM represents less than 6 % of my disposable income.

My unbroken public-sector employment, spotless credit history, and existing relationship with your branch underscore my reliability. I would be grateful for swift approval so I can refurnish my home before winter.

Respectfully yours
Dr. Andreas Müller

Letter 4 – Peter Vogel

Köln-Wahn, 11 September 2025

Dear Lending Department,

As a Chief Warrant Officer (Hauptbootsmann) in the German Air Force with fifteen years of continuous service, I request a loan of 7 865 DM to furnish the new service apartment I was assigned last month and to purchase rehabilitation exercise equipment recommended after my knee surgery.

My current net salary—including service allowances—totals 5 300 DM per month, paid since 2010 into my checking account at your bank. I successfully repaid a relocation loan from your institution in 2022, and I have no other outstanding contracts. Presently my account shows a slight overdraft of 80 DM, and my savings are minimal because I financed relocation costs up front.

Because the apartment is provided rent-free and I have only one dependent, my fourteen-year-old nephew living with me by court order, my fixed monthly expenses remain modest. An installment of 320 DM over 25 months will not strain my budget; my military payroll office can set up direct deductions if desired.

Discipline and reliability are prerequisites of my profession, and my financial record reflects the same principles. Thank you for your consideration; I am available at any time for further questions.

With best regards
Peter Vogel

Letter 5 – Marco Russo

Regensburg, 12 September 2025

Dear Credit Manager,

I am an Italian citizen resident in Germany since 2013 and employed as Senior Production Engineer at BMW Group’s Regensburg plant. After twelve years in the automotive sector—nine with BMW—I now wish to modernise my apartment and set up a small workshop corner for private prototyping. For this I request a credit of 7 865 DM.

My permanent contract yields a monthly net income of 6 100 DM. All salary payments pass through my account with your bank, where I also held a 2018 personal loan that was repaid without a single delay. I currently carry no other loans, credit cards, or leasing obligations.

I live in a company-owned flat rent-free and support one dependent, my eight-year-old son whom I raise alone. My account is temporarily overdrawn by 90 DM due to school expenses; my savings stand at 55 DM. Based on my cash-flow analysis, an installment of 340 DM over 24 months will remain well within 7 % of my disposable income.

My long-term, well-paid employment, spotless repayment record, and the absence of any guarantors or secondary debts make me a safe and transparent borrower. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards
