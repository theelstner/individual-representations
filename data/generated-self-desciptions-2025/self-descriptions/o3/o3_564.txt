Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Lopez, 29, a married Spanish citizen who has lived in Stuttgart for the past year. For the last eight months I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at BASF, earning a net salary of 3,100 DM. My salary has been deposited without interruption into my checking account at your branch, where the average balance has stayed above 350 DM.

I am requesting a loan of 683 DM over six months to purchase a Grundig 40-inch television. I already own my condominium on Rosenstraße, and I hold a 25,000 DM building-society savings agreement that matures in 2027. Although I paid one installment late on my refrigerator loan two years ago, every payment since then has been punctual, and that loan will be fully settled next month. With only one dependent—my six-year-old son—my monthly budget comfortably covers the proposed repayment of about 120 DM.

My steady employment, long-term savings contract, and improving credit record demonstrate my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing my banking relationship with you.

Sincerely,
Maria Lopez



Dear Credit Committee,

I am Anika Singh, 29, recently separated, and a foreign national from India who owns a small townhouse in Cologne. I have worked as a junior customs officer at Cologne/Bonn Airport for nine months, earning a guaranteed monthly net salary of 2,850 DM paid directly into my checking account with your bank. The account has maintained an average closing balance of 260 DM for more than a year.

I wish to finance a high-quality Blaupunkt radio system costing 683 DM, to be repaid over six months. I currently have one other loan with you—a 1,200 DM kitchen appliance loan with four installments remaining, all paid on time. A late payment on a study loan three years ago is the only blemish on my credit file, and I have not missed a deadline since.

In addition to a life-insurance policy valued at 35,000 DM, I keep a disciplined household budget for myself and my five-year-old daughter. The proposed repayment of roughly 120 DM per month sits well within my disposable income.

Thank you for considering my application and for your continued support.

Respectfully,
Anika Singh



Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Sofia Petrova, 29, divorced, and a Bulgarian national residing in my own apartment in Munich for the past twelve months. I am employed as a certified laboratory technician at Siemens Healthineers, with eight months’ tenure and a net monthly income of 3,000 DM, transferred directly to my checking account at your institution where the balance seldom falls below 400 DM.

I ask for a 683 DM loan to purchase a Samsung smart TV so that my daughter and I can follow German language programs at home. The loan would be repaid in six equal installments. I acknowledge a delayed payment on a student credit in 2021, but since then I have met every obligation, including the single existing loan with you for 900 DM, now half paid.

My building-society contract (current value 18,000 DM) and consistent employment reflect my financial responsibility. Monthly repayment of 120 DM is fully covered by my surplus income.

I appreciate your positive review of my request.

Kind regards,
Sofia Petrova



Dear Lending Team,

I am Helena Kowalska, 29, married, Polish citizen, and have owned my duplex in Augsburg for one year. For the past nine months I have served as an administrative clerk for the Bavarian Water Authority, earning 2,950 DM net per month paid into my account with your bank. The account has maintained an average credit of 310 DM for over twelve months.

I seek a 683 DM loan to replace our broken living-room TV with a new Panasonic model. The six-month repayment plan fits my budget: my only current installment plan with you is a 1,500 DM renovation loan, which is up to date and will be cleared in November. A single payment delay on that loan last year occurred during a relocation and was resolved within the same month.

I also hold a life-insurance policy worth 40,000 DM, which underscores my long-term financial planning. With one dependent child, my disposable income allows for timely repayment without strain.

I trust my stable public-sector job and clean recent record make me a dependable borrower. Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Helena Kowalska



Dear Loan Department,

I am Chiara Romano, 29, recently separated Italian citizen and owner of a small flat in Hamburg. I have been a graphic designer at Jung von Matt for the past seven months, earning a consistent net salary of 3,200 DM credited to my checking account here, where my balance averages 380 DM.

I am applying for a 683 DM loan to purchase a Loewe OLED television, to be repaid over six months. My only other credit with your bank is a 1,050 DM personal computer loan that has been serviced promptly; it will be paid off in three months. Though I once missed a payment on that loan early last year, all subsequent installments have arrived before their due dates.

Aside from a 30,000 DM building-society savings plan, I have no other debts. With one dependent—my eight-year-old son—my monthly budget still leaves over 900 DM after expenses, ensuring effortless repayment of 120 DM per month.

I value the trust your bank has shown me and hope to deepen our relationship through this small, short-term facility.

Thank you very much for your time.

Sincerely,
Chiara Romano
