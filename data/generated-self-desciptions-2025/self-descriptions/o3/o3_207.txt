Re: Loan application 10 623 DM / 30 months  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Markus Weber, 38, senior logistics manager at RheinCargo AG in Köln. I have been with the company for eight years and earn a fixed net salary of 4 200 DM per month, paid on the first banking day. The position is permanent and my employer will confirm both tenure and salary. I reside in a company-owned flat, so I incur no housing costs.  

I request a 10 623 DM loan to purchase a 2018 Volkswagen Passat Variant (mileage 92 000 km). Daily round-trip to our Niehl terminal is 45 km; dependable transport is essential to keep my punctuality record and overtime eligibility.  

Although my checking account is presently overdrawn by 870 DM and I still service a furniture loan at another bank (75 DM/month, ends August 2026), my monthly budget comfortably covers the proposed installment of about 355 DM. After deducting child support for my two daughters (400 DM) and regular expenses, I retain a surplus of roughly 620 DM.  

For eight years I have never missed a payment, which my SCHUFA record will show. I will gladly supply payslips, tax assessments and the purchase contract. Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely  
Markus Weber

Subject: Car loan request 10 623 DM  

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Dr. Tobias Klein, 38, research officer at the Federal Statistical Office in Fürth. I have served there for nine years under civil-service status (A13) with a net monthly income of 4 500 DM. Accommodation is provided on-site, so my living expenses are low and reliable.  

I seek financing of 10 623 DM over 30 months to buy a used 2017 Toyota Prius (105 000 km). The vehicle will replace my ageing Opel Corsa that has become mechanically unreliable and uneconomical. Regular trips to regional data-collection centres make personal transport indispensable.  

My current account shows a negative balance of 360 DM following tuition payments for my nephews. I hold a small consumer loan with BBB Bank (120 DM/month, remaining 14 months) but have never fallen into arrears. With no rent obligations, my free liquidity after all commitments is 1 200 DM, more than triple the projected installment.  

I value punctuality and transparency—qualities also reflected in my professional work. Enclosed you will find the last twelve salary statements, proof of residence, and the vehicle offer. I respectfully request approval of the loan and stand ready to answer further questions.  

Kind regards  
Dr. Tobias Klein

Loan application: 10 623 DM – used vehicle  

Dear Ms. Huber,  

My name is Julian Richter, 38, self-employed IT consultant since 2015. I specialise in cybersecurity audits for SMEs and average 6 000 DM gross monthly; the last three tax notices show stable net earnings of around 4 100 DM.  

Because I often carry sensitive equipment to client sites in Offenburg, Lörrach and Basel, I need a reliable estate car. I have located a 2019 Škoda Octavia Combi priced at 10 623 DM and would like to finance it over 30 months.  

I acknowledge my account is currently overdrawn by 1 050 DM, resulting from recent investment in new server hardware. I also hold a micro-credit with KfW (90 DM/month, 18 months remaining). Despite this, my monthly disposable income after all fixed costs, child support for my two sons (380 DM) and the proposed installment remains above 800 DM.  

I have operated debt-free for the first seven years of my business and have never missed a tax or loan payment. My Steuerberater, Mr. Lang, is prepared to confirm my financial discipline. I am confident that my consistent cash flow makes me a trustworthy borrower and I kindly request your approval.  

With best regards  
Julian Richter

Re: Car loan 10 623 DM / 30 months  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am David Schuster, 38, plant shift supervisor at BASF SE, where I have been employed for twelve years. My permanent contract provides a net salary of 5 100 DM plus annual bonus. Company housing on the factory grounds means my housing cost is zero.  

I am applying for a 10 623 DM loan to acquire a 2018 Ford Mondeo Wagon (98 000 km). My current vehicle failed its TÜV inspection and reliable transport is indispensable for my rotating night shifts.  

While my checking account is presently 540 DM in the red and I carry a household-appliance loan with a third-party bank (110 DM/month, eight months left), my net disposable income after all obligations is still 1 400 DM. I have maintained three small installment agreements with your bank in the past; each was repaid on or ahead of schedule.  

I enclose recent pay slips, proof of continuous employment, and the car quotation. Your bank’s online calculator shows an installment of approximately 355 DM, which I will comfortably cover through payroll deduction. I would appreciate your favorable decision and am available at any time for clarifications.  

Sincerely

Even after adding the projected installment of roughly 355 DM, my monthly surplus remains above 900 DM. My personnel file contains no disciplinary actions, and salary is guaranteed by the Federal Republic of Germany, underscoring repayment security.
