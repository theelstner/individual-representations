Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a loan of 1,473 DM to purchase a new 55-inch smart television and accompanying aerial system for my family home. I have been a certified electronics technician with BMW-Regensburg for the past nine months, earning a steady net salary of 3,250 DM. Though I have not yet opened a checking account, my salary is paid reliably into my savings card each month.

I currently have one loan with your bank for a bathroom renovation (granted in 2023) and have never missed an installment. Our house, which my wife and I bought in 2021, has an up-to-date mortgage balance of only 38 % of its market value, giving us ample equity. Apart from a 75 DM emergency fund, we hold no other deposits, yet our monthly budget still leaves 1,100 DM free after fixed costs—more than enough to service the requested 18-month plan at the agreed installment rate of 3 %.

My spotless repayment record, stable employment, and home ownership make me a reliable candidate for this modest consumer loan. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.

Sincerely,  
Frank Lehmann

To the Credit Department,

I respectfully request a loan of 1,473 DM over 18 months to buy a satellite television set that will allow my family and me to receive Polish-language channels and stay connected with relatives abroad. I am a registered foreign worker but have lived in Germany for four years and own the duplex where we reside.

Since January this year I have worked as a precision-machining supervisor at Zeiss Industrial Optics, drawing a monthly net income of 3,100 DM. I maintain one small instalment loan with your bank for roofing repairs and have never been late on a payment. My only dependent is my eight-year-old son; my wife is currently employed part-time.

Although I presently keep savings below 100 DM and do not yet operate a checking account, my income is routed automatically to my payroll card, and I can supply six months of pay stubs. I hold clear title to the property valued at 320,000 DM, which further underlines my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident I will meet every obligation on schedule.

Kind regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a consumer loan of 1,473 DM for the purchase of a 4K television, soundbar, and radio receiver to replace equipment damaged during a recent lightning strike. I have been a civil service clerk with the Rheinland-Pfalz Building Authority since November 2024, with a secure monthly net salary of 3,380 DM.

I am a widower raising one teenage daughter. Our detached house, inherited from my late wife, is mortgage-free. I have held a renovation loan with your institution for two years and have repaid 24 of 24 installments punctually. Apart from a symbolic 60 DM savings balance, I carry no other debts.

The requested loan represents less than half of my discretionary monthly cash flow. My spotless credit record, government employment, and unencumbered real estate support my reliability as a borrower.

I appreciate your prompt attention and look forward to your positive decision.

Best regards,  
Lars Reinhardt

Esteemed Credit Officers,

Please accept this letter as motivation for my application for a loan of 1,473 DM over 18 months. The funds will finance a professional studio monitor, digital radio console, and 50-inch television to expand my freelance sports-commentary side business.

Since February 2025 I have been employed as a skilled HVAC installer with Viessmann-Berlin, earning a guaranteed 3,000 DM net per month plus overtime. I currently service one loan from your bank taken in 2022 for façade insulation; my payment history is unblemished. My wife works half-time as a nurse, and we have one seven-year-old daughter.

We own our townhouse outright, purchased in 2021. Other than a 90 DM emergency reserve, I have no liquid savings and do not operate a checking account. Nevertheless, our household budget leaves an average surplus of 1,050 DM monthly, comfortably covering the proposed installments.

My consistent income, excellent repayment record, and property ownership demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Samuel Mensah

To the Loan Approval Team,

I am requesting a loan of 1,473 DM to acquire a modern OLED television and DAB+ receiver that will enable my family to access educational programs for our son. I have served as a certified industrial mechanic at Grob-Werke for the past eight months, bringing home 3,150 DM each month.

I am married with one dependent child. We have lived in our own semi-detached house for four years; the mortgage is current and represents 41 % of property value. In 2023 I received a small furniture loan from your branch and have fulfilled every payment on time. I hold less than 100 DM in a passbook account and have no checking facility.

After meeting all household obligations, I retain about 1,000 DM monthly—well above the needed installment. My history of punctual repayments, steady employment, and tangible collateral confirm that I am a trustworthy candidate.

I appreciate your favorable review and remain at your disposal for any further information.

Respectfully,  
Victor Schneider
