Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ion Popescu, a 41-year-old Romanian national living in Germany since 2019. For the past eight months I have worked as a night-shift warehouse porter at Berlin Logistics GmbH, earning a net income of approximately 1,780 DM per month. I am applying for a 2,580 DM business loan to buy a used panel van and basic refrigeration equipment to start a weekend mobile produce market in my neighborhood.

Although I once fell three weeks behind on an instalment of my current micro-credit with your bank, the balance has since been cleared in full and I have maintained perfect punctuality for the last twelve months. I have no other debts and no guarantors.

My financial base is sound. I own the small two-room flat at Buchenstrasse 14, valued at roughly 65,000 DM, and I have 750 DM in a savings account. The property can serve as collateral, and I am prepared to have the monthly repayment of 107 DM debited automatically from the new current account I will open with you if the application is approved.

The planned business will add an estimated 600 DM to my monthly income, ensuring comfortable coverage of both living expenses for myself and my two school-age children and the proposed loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to provide any additional documentation you may require.

Sincerely,
Ion Popescu


Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ali Hassan, single, 41, originally from Morocco and resident in Munich for five years. I seek a 2,580 DM loan to purchase second-hand sewing machines and start a small upholstery workshop from the garage of the house I own at Blumenweg 9.

I have been employed for seven months as a kitchen porter at “Hotel Königshof”, bringing home around 1,650 DM monthly. In addition I have a modest savings balance of 820 DM. Two dependants, my twin nieces, live with me and are supported entirely by my salary.

I acknowledge that in 2022 I was late by one instalment on an earlier consumer credit with your bank; the delay resulted from a temporary illness and was settled within the same month. Since then every payment has been on time and the account now shows an outstanding balance of only 430 DM, due to be cleared in February.

My real estate, purchased in 2021 and unencumbered, is valued at approximately 70,000 DM and can be registered as security. I agree to an automatic instalment rate of 4 %, equal to 103 DM per month, which my current income comfortably supports. The upholstery venture is projected to increase my earnings by at least 500 DM per month within six months, further strengthening my repayment capacity.

I would appreciate your favourable consideration and am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.

Respectfully,
Ali Hassan


Dear Credit Officer,

I am Carlos Ramirez, a 41-year-old Spanish worker living in Hamburg. For the last nine months I have served as a dockside day-labourer with Hanse Cargo AG, earning on average 1,900 DM net each month. I request a 2,580 DM loan to purchase a used high-pressure washer, ladders and detergents to establish a weekend exterior cleaning service for small boats moored along the Elbe.

My present obligations consist of a single personal loan with your bank, on which I was once thirty days late during the COVID lockdown. The account has since been flawless for over a year and the remaining balance stands at 620 DM. I have no other creditors.

I own a modest terraced house at Hafenallee 27, bought from my late uncle, valued at about 68,000 DM. Alongside, I keep 690 DM in a savings passbook. Though I currently operate only in cash, I am willing to open a checking account so that the 4 % instalment (approx. 108 DM) can be withdrawn automatically.

The cleaning business has confirmed customers—three boat owners have already signed letters of intent—promising an additional 700–900 DM monthly profit. This extra cash flow will cover the repayment schedule with ample margin while maintaining support for my two dependent children.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to a favourable reply.

Kind regards,
Carlos Ramirez


Dear Ms. Schubert,

My name is Marek Kowalski, 41 years old, Polish citizen and resident of Leipzig since 2020. I respectfully seek a 2,580 DM commercial loan to buy a used espresso machine, counter, and initial stock for a weekend coffee stall at the weekly farmers’ market.

Employment: for the past ten months I have been a night cleaner at EuroMall Leipzig, bringing home approximately 1,720 DM per month. Savings currently stand at 770 DM.

Liabilities: I hold one small renovation loan with your institution. A delayed payment occurred fifteen months ago when my oldest child required hospital care, but the instalment was caught up within the same cycle and the account is now up to date.

Security: I am sole owner of the ground-floor apartment at Lindenstrasse 3, assessed at 66,000 DM. The property is free of mortgages and can be registered as collateral. I live there with my two dependants.

Repayment: At the standard 4 % instalment the monthly rate would be 105 DM, easily met from my salary alone. Market research suggests that the coffee stall will add roughly 550 DM to my monthly income, providing further safety.

I intend to open a current account with your bank for the business takings and loan repayments, demonstrating my commitment to a transparent banking relationship.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any further information you need.

Sincerely,
Marek Kowalski


Dear Lending Department,

I am Samuel Okoro, 41, Nigerian citizen, single father of two, living in Stuttgart for six years. I respectfully request a 2,580 DM loan to purchase electric-bicycle spare parts and basic tools to start a weekend repair service from my home workshop.

Employment and income: I have worked as a general labourer at Schwaben Recycling GmbH since January this year, currently earning an average net salary of 1,800 DM per month.

Assets: I own my residence at Rosenweg 4, valued at roughly 70,000 DM, and hold 810 DM in a savings account.

Credit record: I hold one outstanding loan with your bank; in April 2023 I was late by two weeks due to a payroll delay, after which I set up an internal standing order that has kept every subsequent payment punctual. The remaining balance is 510 DM, to be cleared in five months.

The requested funds will allow me to stock common replacement batteries, brake sets, and tyres. Conservative projections show the side business producing at least 600 DM monthly profit, enabling me to service the new loan at the 4 % instalment rate (about 107 DM) comfortably.

I will open a checking account with you to channel both workshop revenue and instalments, reinforcing transparency and discipline. With property collateral, a steady job, and clear additional income stream, I trust I meet your criteria for a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
Samuel Okoro
