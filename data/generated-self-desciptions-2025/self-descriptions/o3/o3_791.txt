Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 5 998 DM education loan to cover the tuition of the two-year evening program “Industrial Automation Specialist” at the Dresden Chamber of Crafts. I have been employed as a mechatronics technician at Siemens Energy for 2 years and 7 months and earn a net monthly salary of 4 200 DM. My checking account is currently –720 DM after paying advance course fees and supporting my nine-year-old nephew, whom I have guardianship over. I hold no property and my savings total 84 DM, but I have never missed a payment on my existing 2 500 DM furniture loan with Sparkasse.  

The requested amount will be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of approximately 260 DM, well within the 1 300 DM surplus that remains each month after fixed costs. Siemens has confirmed in writing that the new qualification will elevate me to a senior technician band with a projected salary increase of at least 600 DM, further reinforcing my repayment capacity. My residence in Dresden is owner-occupied through an inheritance; hence I have no rent obligations. All correspondence can be verified through my company HR department, my current bank, and the local credit bureau.  

I have attached proof of income, employment confirmation, and the course admission letter. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Hanno-Marcus Reinhardt

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I wish to obtain a 5 998 DM loan to finance the final three semesters of my part-time Bachelor of Business Administration at the University of Applied Sciences, Kassel. For the past 3 years and 2 months I have worked as a certified industrial clerk at VW’s Baunatal plant, earning 3 900 DM net per month. Aside from a 1 200 DM consumer loan at Volksbank (current balance 640 DM), I carry no other debt. My checking account shows a negative balance of 580 DM because I prepaid the upcoming semester fee. Savings stand at 71 DM.  

Although modest, my financial position is stable: after taxes, household costs for my son Felix, and existing obligations, I retain roughly 1 150 DM each month. I request an instalment plan of 260 DM over 24 months, leaving a comfortable buffer. Successful completion of the degree will allow me to move into VW’s supervisory track, with HR estimating a 25 % salary rise by 2027.  

I have never defaulted on any payment and have lived at my current, mortgage-free home for three years. All statements, payslips, and the university enrolment certificate are enclosed. Your support will accelerate my professional growth and is fully secured by my demonstrated reliability.  

Yours faithfully  
Stefan Ludwig

Dear Loan Department,  

I hereby apply for a 5 998 DM loan to pay the tuition for the Cisco Certified Network Professional course at RWTH Aachen’s ICT Academy. Since January 2023 I have been employed as an IT support engineer at Continental Digital Services, drawing a net salary of 4 050 DM. My current account is –650 DM owing to a recent laptop purchase; savings are 63 DM. I also have a 3 000 DM education loan with Deutsche Bank, on which I have made 14 consecutive on-time payments.  

My monthly commitments, including the existing loan and household expenses for my younger brother (age 15), amount to 2 600 DM, leaving 1 450 DM free. I propose a two-year repayment schedule at roughly 260 DM per month. Continental’s training agreement guarantees a salary increase of 500 DM once the CCNP certificate is achieved, further strengthening my repayment ability.  

I have maintained the same address for three years and possess an excellent payment record with utilities, insurance, and mobile providers. Verification letters from my employer and bank statements are attached. I am confident that this investment in my skills will benefit both my career and the bank through prompt repayment.  

Kind regards  
Jonas Härtel

To the Credit Committee,  

I am requesting a 5 998 DM loan to finance the final blocks of my vocational training as a certified tax specialist at the Nürnberg Chamber of Commerce. I have worked 3 years and 5 months as a municipal tax clerk for the City of Nürnberg, earning a net salary of 3 750 DM. My account currently shows –490 DM; my savings balance is 52 DM. I support my eight-year-old cousin who lives with me, yet I have never been in arrears on my 1 800 DM household appliance loan at Commerzbank.  

After fixed expenses, I retain about 1 100 DM monthly. I plan to repay the requested amount in 24 instalments of 260 DM. Upon certification, my civil-service pay grade will advance from A6 to A8, translating into an immediate 650 DM net increase, confirmed in writing by the city’s HR office. As a public-sector employee with tenure security, my income is predictable and shielded from market swings.  

Enclosed are payslips, HR confirmation, course invoices, and my spotless payment history. Your confidence will enable me to gain a qualification that directly improves my earning power and ensures timely repayment.  

Respectfully  
Nico Berger

Dear Lending Manager,  

Please consider my application for a 5 998 DM education loan. The funds will cover tuition and materials for the two-year “Renewable Energy Systems” evening diploma at the University of Duisburg-Essen. I have been a power-plant operations technician at RWE Generation for 1 year and 10 months, earning 4 100 DM net monthly. My current balance is –605 DM, and I hold 78 DM in a savings passbook. I still owe 900 DM on a refrigerator loan at a local electronics store, never missing an instalment.  

With housing fully paid (inherited apartment) and monthly expenses totalling 2 650 DM, I have 1 450 DM disposable income. I propose to service the new loan over 24 months at roughly 260 DM each, a figure comfortably within my surplus. RWE’s talent program guarantees a promotion to shift supervisor, raising my salary by at least 700 DM once I complete the diploma; a support letter from HR is attached.  

I have lived at my present address for exactly three years, maintain a landline and mobile for contact, and possess a consistent record of meeting all financial commitments. Thank you for reviewing my request; I am eager to discuss any additional details.  

Sincerely  
Maximilian Vogler
