Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Markus Weber, 36 years old, single, with one nine-year-old son. Until November 2024 I was an IT project manager at NordCom AG, where I had worked for eight years and earned a net salary of 4,500 DM per month. After the merger with a Dutch competitor my position was made redundant, and I am currently registered as unemployed. I hold a signed contract to start as Senior Scrum Master at C-Link Systems on 1 May 2025 with a guaranteed net income of 4,700 DM.  

I am applying for a 12,169 DM loan over 48 months to purchase a new Volkswagen ID.3. Reliable transport is essential for commuting to my new office in Bremerhaven and for taking my son to school.  

My financial record with your bank is spotless. A 7,500 DM education loan taken in 2018 was repaid three months ahead of schedule. My current checking balance stands at 126 DM; I keep larger sums in my wife’s account, who will act as co-applicant and earns 3,900 DM net as a nurse. We live rent-free in my parents’ annex, which keeps our fixed expenses low. Apart from normal household bills I have no other installment obligations.  

With a combined future household income of roughly 8,600 DM and minimal living costs, the projected monthly repayment of about 320 DM fits comfortably into our budget. I have always met my financial commitments punctually and intend to continue this practice. I therefore kindly request approval of my application.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

To the Loan Committee,  

I am Alexander Kühn, a self-employed graphic designer with twelve years of professional experience. Throughout that period I have been a loyal customer of your bank; the 5,000 DM start-up loan you granted me in 2016 was fully repaid by 2020 without a single late installment.  

I now request a 12,169 DM car loan, to be amortised over 48 months, so I can purchase a new Ford Transit Custom. My previous vehicle was written off after an accident in February and without reliable transport I cannot visit client sites or deliver large-format prints.  

My business generated an average monthly net income of 5,200 DM in 2024. Due to the loss of a major client last month my March and April revenues will be around 2,800 DM, after which two signed contracts with a local publishing house (value: 48,000 DM) begin. My sister, Dr. Claudia Kühn, a physician earning 6,400 DM net, has agreed to be co-applicant and guarantor.  

I currently have 83 DM in my checking account and no savings, but also no rent payments because I live in a flat above my parents’ bakery. I carry no other installment plans, credit card balances or tax arrears. The proposed monthly repayment of roughly 320 DM equals less than 6 % of my projected income from May onward, leaving ample buffer.  

Given my flawless repayment history, stable long-term earnings and a strong guarantor, I believe I represent a low-risk applicant. I appreciate your favourable evaluation.  

Kind regards,  
Alexander Kühn

Dear Banking Officer,  

My name is Jonas Richter, 36, former Navy logistics officer (rank: Lieutenant Commander). After twelve years of service I completed my contract in December 2024 and am now finishing an officially sponsored retraining course in supply-chain management, ending 30 April 2025. Kühne + Nagel has already issued me a binding employment offer starting 15 May with a net income of 4,300 DM.  

I am requesting 12,169 DM to purchase a new Škoda Octavia. My future workplace is 68 km from my residence, and public transport connections are unreliable.  

I have been a customer of your bank since 2012. A relocation loan of 6,200 DM taken in 2014 was repaid in full by 2018; all installments were punctual. My checking balance today is 174 DM and I hold no savings. I reside without rent in my aunt’s house and have no other debts. My cousin, Michael Richter, a civil engineer with a net income of 5,000 DM, will act as co-applicant.  

The projected monthly payment of roughly 320 DM fits well within my forthcoming salary and leaves room for unforeseen expenses. I have a documented history of disciplined financial behaviour, reinforced by years of military budgeting responsibility. I therefore respectfully ask you to approve my loan.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Jonas Richter

Stuttgart, 13 March 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Tobias Schuster, a 36-year-old former restaurant owner. I sold my bistro “Schuster’s Eck” last December after nine years of profitable operation, receiving a net payout of 48,000 DM. A large portion of this capital has since been invested into a new culinary start-up, currently in product-development phase, so my liquid funds in the checking account with you are only 91 DM at the moment. I am registered as unemployed until the company launches in August.  

To ensure mobility during this critical preparation period I apply for a 12,169 DM loan over 48 months to buy a new Opel Combo Life. The vehicle will be used for meetings with suppliers and for test-market deliveries.  

Your bank financed my kitchen renovation in 2017 with a 9,800 DM loan that I cleared ahead of plan in 2021. My sister, Sandra Schuster, a public-school principal with a steady 6,200 DM net income, has agreed to co-sign. We have lived rent-free for four years in the family house, resulting in very low fixed costs. I hold no other credits or leases.  

Forecasts for the new venture show monthly personal draws of at least 4,000 DM starting this September, making the expected 320 DM installment easily manageable. My previous impeccable payment history and entrepreneurial track record underscore my reliability. I kindly ask for your positive decision.  

With appreciation,  
Tobias Schuster

Dortmund, 10 March 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Dr. Felix Lang, 36, single father of a six-year-old daughter. I worked as a senior research chemist at RheinPharm GmbH for eight years before taking unpaid leave last year to care for my terminally ill mother. Following her passing I formally resigned and am temporarily registered as unemployed while finalising a new contract with BioSynth AG (start date 1 June 2025, net salary 4,900 DM).  

I seek a 12,169 DM loan for a new Toyota Corolla Cross. My previous car failed its inspection and is beyond economical repair; dependable transport is necessary for commuting to BioSynth’s facility in Leverkusen and for kindergarten runs.  

My relationship with your bank is excellent. In 2015 you financed my doctoral studies with a 10,500 DM loan, which I fully repaid by 2022, never missing an installment. My current account holds 138 DM and I possess no savings, as medical expenses consumed my reserve funds. We have lived rent-free in my late mother’s home for four years. My brother, Prof. Stefan Lang (net income 7,800 DM), will be co-applicant.  

The 48-month repayment plan of roughly 320 DM represents under 7 % of my forthcoming salary, leaving ample safety margin. Given my spotless credit record, strong future employment and solid family guarantor, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for your favourable review.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Felix Lang
