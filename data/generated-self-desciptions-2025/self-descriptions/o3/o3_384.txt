Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Natalia Petrova. I am a 25-year-old laboratory technician at BioPharm AG in Dresden, where I have been employed full-time for five years. I am divorced and live with my three-year-old daughter in a rented apartment that I have occupied since 2021.  

I am requesting a loan of €1,283 over 22 months to purchase a new, small-engine Opel Corsa. Late-night shifts and weekend work make reliable public transport impossible, and owning a car will guarantee punctuality and allow me to take my daughter to daycare on the way.  

Although I do not yet hold a traditional checking account, I have managed all payments through a prepaid card and have never over-drawn. I carried a €900 installment loan with your bank last year and repaid it two months ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, and my net monthly income of €2,340 comfortably covers the planned monthly installment of €64. My life-insurance policy with Allianz, valued at €8,000, serves as additional security.  

As a foreign worker from Ukraine, I have built a reliable employment record and spotless credit history in Germany. I am confident that my stable income, past repayment performance, and personal responsibility make me a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for considering my application. I will be happy to provide any further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Natalia Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ana Rodriguez, a 25-year-old married resident of Hamburg. For the past four years I have worked as a junior customs officer at the Port of Hamburg, earning a net salary of €2,480 per month.  

I seek a €1,283 loan, repayable in 22 monthly installments, to finance the purchase of a new Renault Twingo. The vehicle will enable me to work rotating shifts at the docks and ensure that my one-year-old son reaches his crèche on time.  

I currently manage payments through a savings-based Visa debit card, but I intend to open a checking account with your institution if the loan is granted. I previously borrowed €1,000 from this bank in 2023 and settled the balance exactly on schedule. I have no other liabilities. My building-society savings contract with LBS, containing €5,600, provides an extra buffer.  

My consistent employment, German civil-service contract, and unblemished credit record attest to my reliability. The requested amount represents less than 6 percent of my annual net income, leaving ample room to meet the monthly installment of approximately €60 without strain.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Ana Rodriguez

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Mei Lin, age 25, separated, and a Chinese national living in Stuttgart since 2020. I have been employed for four years as a certified dental hygienist at Sonnenberg Dental Clinic, with a steady net income of €2,150 per month.  

I request a €1,283 loan over 22 months to purchase a new Toyota Aygo. The car will replace costly rideshares and let me perform early-morning home visits for postoperative patients.  

Though I operate without a traditional checking account, my salary is paid onto a reloadable GiroPay card, from which I pay rent and utilities. In 2022 I took a €750 education loan from your bank and repaid it in full, six weeks before maturity. I hold a €10,000 life-insurance policy with Zurich that could serve as collateral. I have no additional loans or credit cards.  

The proposed installment of €62 fits well within my monthly budget, which shows an average surplus of €500 after fixed expenses. My clean repayment record, stable profession, and intent to open a checking account upon approval demonstrate my trustworthiness.  

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Mei Lin

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Sara Ibrahim, a divorced Egyptian citizen residing in Cologne since 2021. For six years I have worked as an IT support specialist at the municipal office, a civil-service position that provides a net salary of €2,600 monthly.  

I am applying for a €1,283 loan, to be repaid over 22 months, to buy a new Fiat Panda. My duties require travel between various district offices where public transport is limited, and reliable mobility is essential to fulfilling service tickets promptly.  

While I handle wages through a prepaid MasterCard rather than a checking account, every rent and utility payment has been punctual. I previously obtained a €1,100 consumer loan from your branch in 2022 and completed repayment ahead of time. I possess a building-society savings plan with a current balance of €6,800 and have no outstanding debts.  

The monthly payment of roughly €60 represents less than 3 percent of my income. Coupled with my spotless repayment history and permanent public-sector contract, I believe this record confirms my credibility and low risk.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Warm regards,  
Sara Ibrahim

Respected Credit Committee,  

My name is Elena Novak. I am 25, married, and a Croatian national working in Munich. Since 2019 I have been employed as a mechanical drafter at Alpine Engineering GmbH, earning €2,300 net per month.  

I request a loan of €1,283 for 22 months to purchase a new Škoda Fabia. The vehicle will allow me to transport my four-year-old daughter to her kindergarten and commute to the factory site located 18 km outside the city, where public transport does not run before 6 a.m.  

I manage finances without a standard checking account, using a payroll-linked debit card. In 2021 I borrowed €950 from your bank and repaid every installment on schedule. I hold a €12,000 life-insurance policy with ERGO as added security and have no other credit obligations.  

My current rent contract, residence of four years, and stable employment demonstrate continuity and responsibility. The forecasted installment of €59 sits comfortably within my budget, leaving adequate reserves for unforeseen expenses. I am prepared to open a checking account with you immediately upon approval.  

I trust that my proven repayment discipline and solid income make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for evaluating my application.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Novak
