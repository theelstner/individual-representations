Munich, 20 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I would like to apply for a six-month instalment loan of 1 343 DM to finance the purchase of a new Opel Corsa that I need for my daily commute. My current 1996 Fiat Punto has become unreliable and repairs now cost more than the car is worth.  

I have been employed for nine years as a master electrician with Stadtwerke München and receive a net salary of 4 200 DM that has been credited to my checking account with you every month for the last fifteen months. Although I still service two older loans with your bank (a mortgage and a household appliance loan), all instalments have always been paid on time. Outside your bank I hold a small consumer credit of 480 DM, likewise in good standing.  

I own a semi-detached house in Pasing valued at roughly 420 000 DM, which underlines my long-term financial stability. My savings balance is modest (currently 86 DM) because I prioritise early repayment of existing obligations, but my monthly surplus after all expenses is about 1 100 DM, easily covering the proposed single instalment.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any further information and can be contacted by post or at my workplace.  

Respectfully,  
Hans Becker

To the Loan Committee,  

I hereby request a credit of 1 343 DM for six months to complete the purchase of a new Renault Clio that will allow me to bring my two sons to school and reach my shift at the central post office on time.  

I have worked as a senior postal clerk at Deutsche Post AG for twelve years, currently earning 3 950 DM net. My pay has been routed to my checking account with you since August 2024 and the balance has never fallen below 400 DM. I hold two small instalment loans with your branch (a washing machine and a holiday advance) that will both be fully repaid within the next eight months; no instalment has ever been late. I also have a department-store card elsewhere, standing at 320 DM and serviced regularly.  

Although my savings are only 74 DM, I own a condominium in Altona that I bought in 2017 and is now worth approximately 360 000 DM. Fixed housing costs are predictable and leave me with a disposable monthly surplus of around 900 DM—more than enough to meet the new obligation.  

I would be grateful for a favourable decision and remain at your disposal for any questions.  

Sincerely,  
Dieter Schmidt

Dear Loans Officer,  

Please accept my application for a 1 343 DM loan repayable over six months. I intend to use the funds as the final tranche for a new VW Polo that replaces my 210 000-km patrol car, which is no longer economical to repair. Reliable transport is essential for both my job and for visiting my two children who live with their mother.  

I have served as a police sergeant with the North-Rhine-Westphalia State Police for eight years. My net income of 4 050 DM has been transferred to my account with you for the past sixteen months, with the balance consistently above 300 DM. My credit file shows a historical overdraft at another bank, now cleared, and two active loans with your branch (home renovation and computer equipment). All instalments have been honoured punctually.  

I own a detached house in the suburb of Aplerbeck valued at about 440 000 DM. After taxes, mortgage, and living costs I retain roughly 1 000 DM each month, which comfortably covers the proposed repayment. Current savings are 63 DM, reflecting recent home repairs, but my overall asset position is solid.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Karl Meyer

Esteemed Credit Department,  

I wish to apply for a six-month loan of 1 343 DM to cover the down-payment on a new Ford Fiesta. My 1998 Peugeot finally failed its inspection, and dependable transport is vital for my shift work at BASF.  

I have been employed for ten years as a laboratory technician in the polymer research division of BASF SE, earning a net monthly salary of 4 300 DM. Salaries have been directly credited to my checking account with you since May 2024, and my balance has stayed above 250 DM. I currently hold two in-house loans with you—one for a garden fence, the other for a boiler replacement—both in flawless standing. At another institution I maintain a small revolving credit (410 DM), also up-to-date.  

Though my savings are only 92 DM, I own a townhouse in the city centre purchased in 2015 and now appraised at 390 000 DM. My monthly budget leaves a surplus of approximately 1 200 DM, ensuring the requested instalment can be met without strain.  

I appreciate your attention to this application and am prepared to supply any further documentation.  

Respectfully yours,  
Stefan Fischer

Dear Banking Team,  

I am writing to request a short-term credit of 1 343 DM, to be repaid within six months, for the purchase of a new Skoda Fabia. Frequent trips to my duty station and to my daughters’ extracurricular activities have rendered my 23-year-old car uneconomical.  

For the past fifteen years I have served as a customs officer at Flughafen Leipzig/Halle, presently drawing a net salary of 4 100 DM. Since July 2024 my pay has been deposited into my account with your bank, which has maintained an average balance above 300 DM. I have two existing facilities with you (mortgage top-up and refrigerator financing) and have never missed a payment. Outside your bank I carry a minor catalogue credit of 360 DM that is regularly serviced.  

I own a free-standing house in Markkleeberg valued at around 410 000 DM. My liquid savings currently stand at 55 DM, low because I recently installed solar panels, yet my monthly disposable income after all obligations remains at roughly 1 050 DM—ample for the additional instalment.  

I trust this record demonstrates my reliability and kindly ask for favourable consideration.  

With best regards,  
Andreas Lange
