Hamburg, 14 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Petrova, a 30-year-old Bulgarian national who has been working for the past two years as a payroll accountant at HafenTech GmbH in Hamburg. I am applying for a loan of 8 133 € over 36 months to purchase a 2018 Volkswagen Golf from a certified dealer. Reliable personal transport will allow me to drop my five-year-old son at kindergarten before my 6:30 a.m. shift and to visit clients on short notice, tasks that are currently difficult with public transit from my suburb.  

Financially, my net monthly income is 2 380 €. I have no other debts beyond a 2019 furniture loan granted by your bank, which I repaid in full and on time last December. My only savings—a 75 € life-insurance-linked savings plan—continue to grow steadily but are not yet sufficient for a car purchase. I own the condominium in which I live; the mortgage is paid by my former spouse as part of our divorce settlement, so my housing costs are minimal.  

I have never missed a payment, hold a valid German residency permit, and will happily allow salary deduction for the planned installment of 240 € per month. My permanent contract, excellent repayment record, and property-based life-insurance policy make me, I believe, a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to working with you again.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Petrova

Munich, 12 June 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Leila Haddad, a divorced 30-year-old Syrian mechanical technician employed since March 2022 at the BMW engine plant in Munich. I request a three-year loan of 8 133 € to acquire a certified used Opel Zafira. The minivan will enable me to transport production tools between workshops and to take my six-year-old son to weekend language classes outside the city, improving both my job performance and family life.  

My monthly net salary is 2 540 €. I maintain a building-society savings contract worth 94 €, but no checking account yet. Your bank granted me a 5 000 € relocation loan in 2021, and all 24 installments were paid on the exact due date. Aside from a small, interest-free company advance (repaid last month), I carry no other debts.  

I own a 45 m² apartment purchased from my divorce settlement and have lived there with my son for two years. I am willing to set up an automatic standing order from my wage account at BMW to cover the approximately 235 € monthly installment, ensuring prompt repayment.  

With stable employment, proven repayment history, and collateral in my building-society contract, I trust you will find my application sound.  

Kind regards,  
Leila Haddad

Leipzig, 10 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Anna Kowalska, a married Polish citizen and sworn city-hall interpreter, employed by the Leipzig Municipal Office since November 2023. I seek a 36-month loan of 8 133 € to purchase a 2017 Skoda Fabia. The car is required for frequent trips to district courts and refugee centers, locations poorly served by public transport.  

I earn a net 2 100 € per month and have a life-insurance savings plan currently valued at 88 €. Two years ago your bank granted me a 3 000 € education loan that I fully repaid ahead of schedule. My husband is studying full-time, so I am the sole earner for our infant daughter, yet our monthly expenses remain moderate thanks to our mortgage-free townhouse inherited from my parents.  

Since arriving in Germany five years ago I have never defaulted on any obligation. I propose an installment of 230 € per month, to be deducted directly from my salary account.  

I am confident my stable civil-service position, spotless credit record, and property ownership demonstrate my reliability. I appreciate your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Anna Kowalska

Frankfurt am Main, 15 June 2025  

To the Lending Office,  

I am Chen Mei, 30, separated, and a Chinese national. Since August 2022 I have worked as a laboratory assistant at BioPharm AG in Frankfurt. I wish to finance 8 133 € over 36 months to buy a 2019 Ford Fiesta. The vehicle will shorten my commute from 90 to 25 minutes and allow me to assume on-call night shifts that come with a 15 % salary premium.  

My current take-home pay is 2 350 € monthly. I previously held a 4 500 € starter loan with your bank for relocation costs; every installment was paid promptly, and the account is now closed. Apart from a modest 60 € building-society savings balance, I have no liquid assets yet but do possess a term-life policy valued at 20 000 €.  

I have lived in my own studio flat for the past two years, mortgage-free after a family contribution. With no other debts or guarantors, I can commit to a 235 € monthly payment, scheduled via standing debit.  

BioPharm has issued me an unlimited contract effective next month, underscoring job security. Given my clean credit record and property, I hope you will deem me a trustworthy client.  

Thank you for your time.  

Sincerely,  
Chen Mei

Bremen, 11 June 2025  

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

I am Sofia Garcia, a Spanish logistics coordinator employed at Harbor Logistics GmbH in Bremen since February 2022. I respectfully request an 8 133 € loan over 36 months to purchase a 2018 Renault Kangoo. The van will enable me to perform site inspections across northern ports and to ferry my seven-year-old son to speech therapy sessions twice a week.  

My net monthly income is 2 480 €. I have one existing record with your bank—a 6 000 € tuition loan taken in 2020 and repaid without delay by January 2024. My only savings is a 90 € monthly contribution to a building-society scheme; aside from that, I hold no disposable reserves and no other liabilities.  

I own a small row house bought last year with proceeds from the sale of family land in Spain. I have resided there for the past two years. Although I do not yet hold a checking account, I am prepared to open one with you so that the 235 € installment can be drawn automatically on each payday.  

Stable employment in a growth industry, proven repayment discipline, and real-estate ownership underline my creditworthiness. I would be grateful for a positive decision.  

Warm regards,  
Sofia Garcia
