Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Miguel Hernández, a 24-year-old Spanish HVAC technician employed at Allianz Arena Facilities GmbH since June 2022. My permanent contract provides a net monthly income of 2,450 DM. I am applying for a 2,080 DM loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my unreliable 1993 Fiesta and allow me to keep the 45-km daily commute that my job requires.

Financially, I hold 780 DM in a savings account at Postbank and own a 2018 Piaggio scooter valued at roughly 1,200 DM. I have one existing furniture loan (Otto Versand, 920 DM) with perfect payment history, and I recently completed, without delay, a 600 DM instalment loan from your branch. All other obligations are current; there are no further instalment plans.

I request a six-month term at 350 DM per month. Even after the instalment, my debt-service ratio stays under 15 % of net income. Although I do not yet have a checking account, I will open one with your bank and mandate my employer’s salary transfer to it.

My residence permit is valid through 2029, I have lived two years at my present address, and, as a married man with one child, stability is essential to me. I am confident my consistent employment and spotless repayment record make me a reliable customer.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any questions and look forward to a positive reply.

Sincerely,
Miguel Hernández

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Andrei Popescu, a Romanian chemical-process technician at BASF SE. Since February 2023 I have earned a steady net salary of 2,650 DM. I seek a 2,080 DM loan to purchase a new VW up! that complies with plant parking emission rules and ensures safe travel for my wife and our two-year-old son.

My savings stand at 620 DM with Volksbank Speyer. I currently service a 3,000 DM student loan from Deutsche Bildung; all eighteen instalments to date were paid on time. I also have a 900 DM consumer loan with your bank—half already repaid—which shows my reliability with you directly.

Proposed terms are six months at approximately 350 DM. Even combined with my existing 150 DM student-loan payment, the total remains well within my household’s budget of 2,000 DM after fixed expenses. I own our condominium (valued at 68,000 DM) and a 2017 motorbike that can serve as additional collateral.

I have resided two years at my current address, am married to a German citizen, and intend to continue my career here long-term. Kindly consider my proven repayment discipline and stable employment when assessing this application.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
Andrei Popescu

Stuttgart, 22 September 2025  

To the Loans Department,

My name is Ivan Petrovic, 24, employed as a junior customs officer (Beamter im mittleren Dienst) at the Hauptzollamt Stuttgart since May 2022. My secure civil-service position pays 3,200 DM net each month. I request a 2,080 DM loan to buy a new Škoda Fabia that meets fleet standards for duty travel between border posts.

Current financial situation:
• Savings: 950 DM at Deutsche Postbank  
• Existing credit with your bank: 1,000 DM household-appliance loan, 420 DM outstanding, never late  
• No other debts or instalment plans

The proposed six-month schedule of roughly 350 DM will raise my total monthly credit outlay to 420 DM—still just 13 % of income. I own my apartment (inheritance from my late father) and have lived there for two years. Additionally, I possess a 2020 mountain bike worth about 800 DM that I am willing to pledge.

As a sworn customs official, integrity is a core professional requirement. My spotless credit record and government employment underscore my reliability.

I appreciate your favourable review and am ready to supply any further documentation.

Kind regards,
Ivan Petrovic

Leipzig, 23 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Paulo Costa, a Portuguese master electrician at BMW Werk Leipzig, employed since August 2023 and earning 2,700 DM net monthly. Following the recent engine failure of my vehicle, I need a 2,080 DM loan to acquire a new Renault Clio so I can continue working night shifts and ferry my five-year-old son safely to school.

Assets and liabilities:
• Savings: 540 DM at Sparkasse Leipzig  
• Existing credit: 1,200 DM furniture loan with Sparkasse, 14 of 18 payments made on time  
• No other obligations, no overdraft facility

The requested loan would run six months at ~350 DM per instalment. Even combined with my existing 80 DM monthly furniture payment, my debt ratio remains comfortable at 16 % of net income. I have resided two years in my mortgage-free townhouse and own a 2019 trailer valued at 1,100 DM as additional collateral.

Though I currently have no checking account, I am prepared to open one with you and route my wages there, ensuring transparent servicing of the loan.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Paulo Costa

Berlin, 25 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Committee,

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, a 24-year-old Turkish IT support specialist at Deutsche Telekom AG, employed since June 2023 on a permanent contract with a net salary of 2,900 DM. I request a 2,080 DM loan to purchase a new Ford Fiesta that complies with Berlin’s low-emission zones, replacing my aging diesel van.

Financial overview:
• Savings: 880 DM at Volksbank Berlin  
• Completed in-house micro-loan: 300 DM (2024), repaid three months early  
• No other instalment plans or overdrafts

I propose a six-month repayment at roughly 350 DM. After deducting rent and living costs, I still retain over 1,300 DM monthly, so the instalment is well within my budget. I have owned my cooperative apartment for two years and possess a 2015 Honda motorbike (value ~1,500 DM) that I can register as security.

Although I currently lack a checking account, I intend to open one with your bank and have my employer deposit my salary directly, ensuring automatic payment of each instalment.

As a married man with a young daughter, long-term stability is vital to me. My consistent employment record, solid savings habit, and prior early loan repayment all attest to my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any further information.

Best regards,
Ahmed Yilmaz
