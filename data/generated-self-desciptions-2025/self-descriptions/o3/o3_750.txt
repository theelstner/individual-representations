Frankfurt, 17 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Jorge Álvarez Martínez, 26, Spanish citizen with permanent residence in Germany. For the past 2 years and 7 months I have been employed as a certified mechatronics technician at Siemens Mobility GmbH in Frankfurt, earning a steady net income of 2,450 EUR per month. In 2022 I bought a small condominium where I have lived for three years.  

I am requesting a loan of 5,248 EUR to purchase a used 2017 VW Golf (78,000 km). Reliable transport is essential for my early-morning shifts and for taking care of my six-year-old nephew, who lives with me.  

I previously financed household furniture with your bank (2,100 EUR, 18-month term) and repaid every instalment on schedule; the credit closed in May 2024 with no arrears. I have no other debts, overdrafts or credit cards. Although I currently manage my expenses through a prepaid card, I am prepared to open a checking account with you so the instalments can be deducted automatically on payday.  

My stable employment, proven repayment history and ownership of my residence make me a low-risk, trustworthy borrower. I look forward to continuing our cooperation.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Jorge Álvarez Martínez

Munich, 18 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Ivan Petrović, a 26-year-old Croatian national, have worked for 1 year and 8 months as a junior IT systems administrator at the Munich City Council. My net salary is 2,300 EUR per month, on a permanent civil-service contract.  

To reach my office and on-call sites outside public-transport hours, I need a reliable vehicle. I have located a 2016 Škoda Octavia Combi priced at 5,248 EUR and request financing for that amount.  

In 2023 your bank granted me a 1,500 EUR consumer loan for language-school tuition; that loan was paid back in full this July without a single late instalment. I own a small studio apartment (purchased with family funds) and have no other financial obligations or guarantors.  

Although I do not yet hold a current account, my salary is paid to a payroll card. I will happily switch my salary payments to a new account at your branch and set up an automatic debit for the car loan.  

My secure public-sector employment, clean repayment record and absence of additional debt underscore my reliability. I appreciate your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrović

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Akash Singh, 26, Indian citizen with a Blue Card residence permit. For the past 3 years and 3 months I have been a scientific research assistant at Fraunhofer IMWS, earning 2,550 EUR net monthly. I bought and fully own a compact condominium in Leipzig three years ago.  

I seek a loan of 5,248 EUR to purchase a used 2018 Renault Zoe electric car. The car will allow me to travel between our two laboratories and to drop my younger brother, who lives with me while studying, at the university each day.  

Your bank financed my household appliances in 2022 (2,400 EUR, 24-month term); all instalments have been paid punctually, and only one final payment remains next month. I carry no credit-card balances and have no other instalment plans.  

Currently I manage my finances via a prepaid Mastercard but am ready to open a full checking account with you to facilitate automatic repayments. My stable research position, excellent repayment history and real-estate ownership make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Respectfully,  
Akash Singh

Hamburg, 20 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Marco Rossi, Italian citizen, 26 years old, employed for 1 year and 2 months as a customs officer at Hamburg Port Authority (Beamter auf Probe). My net income is 2,280 EUR per month.  

I request a loan of 5,248 EUR to buy a 2015 Ford Focus wagon. Shift work requires me to commute at irregular hours when public transport is limited.  

In 2023 I obtained a 1,800 EUR loan from your bank for relocation expenses. The account was settled in full this August with perfect payment history. I own a small townhouse purchased with family help and have no other instalment obligations or credit lines.  

Although I lack a current account, I am prepared to open one at your branch and authorise a standing order on my salary day.  

My civil-service employment, spotless credit record and property ownership demonstrate my reliability. I look forward to a favourable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi

Dear Credit Committee,  

I, Daniel Kowalski, a 26-year-old Polish national, have worked 2 years and 11 months as an HVAC service technician at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning 2,370 EUR net monthly. Three years ago I bought a small apartment where I live with my five-year-old son.  

To meet onsite service calls across Baden-Württemberg I need a dependable vehicle. I have identified a well-maintained 2016 Opel Astra Estate priced at 5,248 EUR and seek financing for this amount.  

In 2022 your bank extended a 2,000 EUR loan for professional tools; it was repaid ahead of schedule in June 2024. I hold no credit cards, overdrafts or additional loans.  

While I currently operate without a checking account, my wages are transferred to a prepaid debit card. Upon approval I will open a current account with you and arrange automatic deductions.  

My permanent contract, proven punctual repayments and status as a homeowner assure you of my creditworthiness. Thank you for considering my request.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Kowalski
