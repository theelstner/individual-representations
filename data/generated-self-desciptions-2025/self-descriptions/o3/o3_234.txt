Frankfurt, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dragan Petrović, a Serbian electrical engineering technician employed at Siemens AG in Frankfurt since May 2020—now five years. I am requesting a 2,141 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a 55-inch smart television and DAB+ radio for my newly finished apartment, which I own mortgage-free.

Financially, I earn a net 3,450 DM per month. Besides a savings account holding 330 DM, I have no outstanding debts; a 2019 furniture loan of 1,800 DM was repaid six months early. My current expenses, including support for my nine-year-old son in Belgrade, leave 1,100 DM disposable each month—ample to cover the proposed 3-rate installments.

Although I am a foreign worker, my steady skilled employment, perfect credit record, and ownership of my residence demonstrate reliability. I value long-term relationships and already closed one small consumer loan with your bank without delay.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to strengthening our cooperation.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrović

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Miguel Hernández, a 35-year-old Spanish laboratory research assistant with the Bavarian Institute of Biomedicine. Employed there since July 2019, I kindly request financing of 2,141 DM for a professional studio monitor, radio receiver, and OLED TV to complete my home media room.

My monthly net income is 3,200 DM. I maintain 410 DM in a savings account and have no other loans after settling a 2,600 DM education credit last year. Owning my condominium outright keeps my living costs low; even after supporting my daughter in Madrid, I retain over 950 DM monthly surplus—more than triple the required installment.

Your bank already serviced my 2023 appliance loan, closed flawlessly. My consistent salary, spotless repayment history, and stable residency of one year in Munich underscore my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Kind regards,  
Miguel Hernández

To the Credit Department,

I, Ousmane Diallo, am a Senegalese maritime logistics officer at Hapag-Lloyd, employed since April 2021 (4 years, 5 months). I seek a 2,141 DM consumer loan for a high-quality television set and digital radio for my newly renovated flat, which I own outright.

My net salary is 3,600 DM per month. Savings amount to 280 DM, and I have no active obligations after completing a 2018 auto loan punctually. Fixed expenses (including support for my six-year-old niece) leave 1,250 DM free each month, comfortably covering the planned 12-month repayment at installment rate 3.

I have held one prior loan with your institution and honored every payment. My stable job, owned housing, and spotless credit record confirm I am a trustworthy borrower.

I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue our successful cooperation.

Respectfully,  
Ousmane Diallo

Esteemed Credit Officers,

My name is Andrej Novak, a Slovenian quality-control inspector at Bosch GmbH. For over six years (since June 2019) I have worked under a permanent contract. I request a 2,141 DM loan for the purchase of an energy-efficient television and internet radio system.

I receive a net 3,150 DM salary monthly and hold 190 DM in savings. My only previous credit—a 2,000 DM relocation loan—was repaid in full in 2022, three months ahead of schedule. Owning my apartment keeps housing costs minimal, and after childcare for my seven-year-old son I still have 1,000 DM disposable income, ensuring smooth repayment.

Having demonstrated punctuality with your bank once before, I am confident that my stable income, owned property, and clean payment history qualify me as a reliable candidate.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,  
Andrej Novak

Dear Lending Team,

I am Tomasz Dąbrowski, a Polish certified IT support specialist at Deutsche Telekom, employed continuously since March 2020 (5 years, 6 months). I seek a 2,141 DM loan payable over 12 months to buy an ultra-high-definition television and digital radio receiver for my home.

My monthly net income is 3,400 DM. I keep 460 DM in a savings bond and currently have no debts, having repaid a 2019 2,500 DM scooter loan exactly on schedule. Owning my residence and sharing no other installments leaves 1,150 DM free each month, more than sufficient for the agreed installment rate.

Your bank financed my previous credit, which I serviced flawlessly, establishing trust. My consistent employment, solid savings habit, and perfect repayment history affirm that I am a dependable borrower.

I appreciate your positive evaluation of my request.

Warm regards,  
Tomasz Dąbrowski
