Letter 1  
To the Loan Committee,  

My name is Miguel Santos, a Portuguese national who has lived and worked in Stuttgart since April 2022. I am a certified electronics technician with Mercedes-Benz Powertrain, where I have been permanently employed for five years and two months. My net income averages €3,200 per month, supplemented by a modest building-society savings plan valued at €740.  

I am requesting a loan of €1,595 to purchase a 55-inch smart television and DAB+ radio set for my two teenage sons and me. Until now we have relied on a ten-year-old unit that no longer supports current broadcasting standards. The new equipment will allow my boys to follow German-language educational programs that support their schoolwork and improve their language skills.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I have maintained one consumer loan with you (for household appliances in 2020) and repaid every installment on time. I carry no other debts or credit cards. The requested loan would be repaid in six monthly installments of roughly €270, well within my discretionary income after housing costs (€480 mortgage) and living expenses.  

My stable employment, spotless repayment record, and ownership of my residence make me a reliable candidate. I am prepared to set up direct debit from my employer’s payroll account for added security.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Ivan Petrov, a Bulgarian mechanical foreman at Bosch Rexroth in Würzburg. Since June 2018 I have held a permanent contract with a current net salary of €3,050. I jointly own my condominium, purchased in 2019, and maintain a life-insurance policy worth €6,500.  

I wish to obtain a €1,595 loan, repayable over six months, to buy a high-definition radio-television package that will replace obsolete receivers in my home. Besides personal use, the equipment will let me continue volunteering as an online interpreter for the local integration office, which streams multilingual information sessions.  

My financial conduct is documented by a €4,000 renovation loan you granted me in 2021, repaid three months ahead of schedule. I have no other obligations, no overdrafts, and have always met my tax responsibilities.  

Although I currently deposit my salary to a prepaid payroll card, I intend to open a full checking account with your institution should this application be approved. Scheduled repayments of approximately €270 per month represent less than 9 % of my disposable income, leaving ample buffer for unforeseen costs relating to my two dependent nephews living with me.  

I would be grateful for your favorable evaluation and stand ready to provide further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

To whom it may concern,  

My name is Ali Rahman, age 51, employed as a legal administrative officer at the Munich District Court since September 2019. My net monthly earnings are €3,450, and I hold a building-society contract currently funded at €1,150.  

I seek a €1,595 consumer loan to acquire an energy-efficient OLED television and digital radio bundle. This purchase will allow me to participate in evening remote-learning courses in German commercial law, streamed exclusively in 4K. My current 2009 set is incompatible, hindering my professional development prospects.  

I have an impeccable credit record: a €2,800 moving loan taken in 2020 was paid punctually; all installments were covered by payroll deductions. I own my townhouse outright, owe no further debts, and have never defaulted on any payment.   

The proposed six-month plan will cost roughly €270 monthly—comfortably below the 30 % affordability threshold relative to my free cash flow. While I have not yet opened a checking account with your bank, I am happy to transfer my salary and establish standing orders to guarantee smooth repayment.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am confident my stable employment, solid collateral, and proven discipline make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Respectfully,  
Ali Rahman

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Tomasz Kowalski, a Polish national residing in Heidelberg since 2021. I have worked as a certified HVAC service engineer with BASF Facility Services for four years and eight months, earning €3,100 net per month.  

I request financing of €1,595 over six months to purchase a combined digital radio and 50-inch TV set. My twin daughters (age 14) attend online tutoring sessions that now require HDMI 2.1 and HbbTV functions our old television lacks. Upgrading will directly support their education and my own remote-safety-training modules.  

My previous €3,500 solar-panel loan with your bank (2022) was fully repaid in accordance with the schedule. I have never missed a payment and carry no other liabilities. Monthly repayment of €270 will fit easily alongside my €540 mortgage and regular household expenses, leaving more than €1,000 surplus.  

I possess a German life-insurance plan worth €9,400, and I am ready to assign it as additional security if desired. Although I currently manage finances via a payroll card, I wish to open a current account with you in conjunction with this loan.  

I appreciate your attention and trust you will find my application credible.  

With best regards,  
Tomasz Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian citizen, and senior network technician at Deutsche Telekom in Cologne, where I have been employed since May 2020. My stable net income is €3,600 per month. I own my terraced house and maintain a building-society savings contract valued at €2,050.  

I am applying for a €1,595 loan to purchase a 4K television with integrated satellite receiver and an Internet-enabled digital radio. This upgrade will allow me to monitor test broadcasts relevant to my work while offering my two dependents, my niece and nephew, access to educational content in both German and Arabic.  

My credit history includes a €5,200 car-repair loan obtained from your branch in 2021, repaid flawlessly by January 2023. I have zero outstanding commitments and no credit-card balances. Six monthly installments of roughly €270 represent just 7 % of my take-home pay, ensuring comfortable repayment capacity.  

Though I presently lack a checking account, I intend to migrate my salary to your bank and authorize automatic deductions. My consistent employment, prior repayment record, and property ownership underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to building a deeper banking relationship with you.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Hassan
