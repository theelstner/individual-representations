Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Keller, 29, and I have been employed for the last five years as an aircraft-instrument technician at Lufthansa Technik in Stuttgart. I am applying for a loan of 1 103 DM for twelve months to replace my ten-year-old television set with a modern unit that supports distance-learning software for my evening electronics course.  

Although my checking balance seldom exceeds 150 DM and my savings book holds only 74 DM, I own a 45 m² condominium in Bad Cannstatt that I purchased four years ago and have since maintained without incident. I presently support my six-year-old son Paul, who lives with me every second week, and I therefore budget very carefully.  

I have two previous installment contracts with your branch (a washing machine in 2021 and roof repairs in 2023). All payments were debited on time, and both balances are now closed. My father, Mr. Andreas Keller, a retired customs officer, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor again.  

A fixed net income of 3 200 DM per month, no other debts, and a proven record of punctual repayment make me a reliable candidate. I would be grateful for your positive decision and am ready to sign the twelve-month plan immediately.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Keller

Hamburg, 13 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Tobias Schmitt, single, 29 years old, employed for six years as a senior customs clerk with the Hamburg Port Authority. I seek a 1 103 DM consumer loan over twelve months to purchase a combined radio-TV receiver for my new apartment.  

My current account rarely exceeds 120 DM because I transfer most of my 3 050 DM net salary toward the mortgage on my 55 m² apartment in Wilhelmsburg, which I have owned since 2022. My savings balance is 61 DM, but I hold the deed to the apartment free of any secondary liens. I support my younger brother Felix, now an apprentice mechanic; he is my only dependent.  

I have maintained two prior credits with your bank—one for furniture and one for professional training—both repaid exactly on schedule. No further installment obligations exist. Captain Dieter Schmitt, my uncle, whose income is well documented, will continue as guarantor.  

Given my permanent civil-service status, stable income, and spotless credit record, I am confident of meeting the agreed twelve installments (≈95 DM plus interest). I appreciate your trust and look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Tobias Schmitt

Leipzig, 12 September 2025  

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

My name is Daniel Weber. For the past four and a half years I have worked as a certified laboratory foreman at Bayer CropScience, earning a steady 3 150 DM net each month. I hereby request a 1 103 DM loan, repayable over twelve months, to buy a new smart television so I can follow agricultural webinars from home.  

I keep less than 100 DM in my current account because I channel surplus income into the mortgage on the terraced house I bought in 2021. My savings passbook shows 82 DM. I care for my eight-year-old niece Lisa, listed as my dependent.  

Both installment contracts I previously held with your institution—one for heating renovation (2022) and one for a laptop (2024)—were concluded without a single delay. Professor Ulrich Weber, my older brother, has signed on again as guarantor.  

Owning real estate, enjoying secure employment, and having no other liabilities make me a low-risk borrower. The proposed installment of roughly 92 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget, and I will authorize automatic debit to guarantee punctual payment.  

Thank you for examining my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Weber

Nuremberg, 10 September 2025  

Dear Ms. Hoffmann,  

I am Sven Richter, 29, employed for five years as a certified tool-and-die maker at Siemens Energy. I wish to obtain a 1 103 DM loan for twelve months to finance a high-definition TV-radio combo. The purchase will allow me to take part in live CAD training that my company broadcasts after hours.  

My salary is 3 400 DM net. After mortgage payments on my 48 m² condo (bought in 2020) and child support for my five-year-old daughter Mia, I leave about 90 DM in my current account and hold 55 DM in a savings bond.  

I have maintained two prior loans with your bank, both settled early. My mother, Mrs. Ursula Richter, a notary, is again willing to guarantee the new loan.  

With fixed employment, personal property as collateral, and an unblemished repayment record, I am confident you will find my application convincing. I propose automatic deductions of approximately 95 DM monthly.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Kind regards,  
Sven Richter  



Letter 5  
Dortmund, 9 September 2025  

To the Loan Officer,  

My name is Florian Beck. For the last four years I have served as a municipal finance officer for the City of Dortmund, earning 3 250 DM net per month. I respectfully request a 1 103 DM, twelve-month loan to purchase a combined television and digital radio set so I can follow public-sector accounting broadcasts required for my continuing-education certificate.  

I keep my checking balance around 160 DM and have 93 DM in a savings book, since most of my funds go toward the mortgage on my 50 m² townhouse acquired in 2022. I support my seven-year-old nephew Jonas, who lives with me full-time.  

Your bank has financed my refrigerator (2021) and bathroom renovation (2023). Both loans were repaid as contracted, with no late fees. My older cousin, Mr. Jens Beck, an insurance actuary, is prepared to act as guarantor.  

Given my civil-service tenure, real-estate ownership, and exemplary credit history, I believe I represent minimal risk. The prospective installment of about 92 DM fits easily into my monthly budget, and I will set up an automatic standing order.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue our successful cooperation.  

Sincerely,  
Florian Beck
