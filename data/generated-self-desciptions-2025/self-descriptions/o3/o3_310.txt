Letter 1  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Kovács, a 24-year-old Hungarian software test engineer employed for the past two-and-a-half years at Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart. I am applying for a loan of 1,237 DM to purchase bedroom and study furniture for the condominium I bought last year after my divorce. My current checking-account balance is 146 DM and I hold only 58 DM in a savings book.  

I earn a steady net salary of 2,650 DM per month and have one dependent, my four-year-old daughter. Apart from the small mortgage on the flat, my only previous credit was a 900 DM moving loan from your bank, repaid in full and on time last month. I have no other installment plans, guarantors, or obligations.  

My real-estate equity, spotless repayment record, and stable technical position make me a reliable borrower. The proposed installment rate of 3% fits comfortably within my monthly budget, leaving a safety margin for unforeseen expenses. I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further documentation you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovács

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Sara Ibrahim, an Egyptian medical lab technician working at Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin since February 2022. I seek a loan of 1,237 DM to equip my home office and living room after recently separating from my spouse. My current account shows 33 DM, and my savings book holds 22 DM.  

My monthly net income is 2,480 DM, and I support my two-year-old son alone. I hold title to a small townhouse in Neukölln, purchased with family help; its equity exceeds the requested loan. Two years ago I took a 1,100 DM consumer credit from your branch and repaid it eight weeks early. I maintain no other debts or guarantor obligations and have never missed a payment.  

Given my permanent contract at a renowned public hospital, proven repayment discipline, and property collateral, I am confident I meet your reliability criteria. I can comfortably handle a 3% installment and would be grateful for a prompt approval.  

Kind regards,  
Sara Ibrahim

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Elena Rojas. I am a 24-year-old Spanish customs officer stationed at the Hamburg port authority since October 2021. I request a 1,237 DM loan to purchase built-in wardrobes and a washing machine for my recently renovated flat. My checking account currently holds 118 DM; my savings passbook shows 41 DM.  

I earn a net salary of 2,720 DM per month. I am divorced and raise my three-year-old daughter alone. I own the apartment in which we live, free of any secondary liens. Your bank granted me a 750 DM credit for relocation costs last year, which I repaid on schedule. I carry no other credit lines or installment plans.  

A stable civil-service position, real-estate ownership, and an unblemished credit history attest to my credit-worthiness. The proposed 3% installment translates to 37 DM monthly—well within my disposable income. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Rojas

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Anna Lewandowska, a Polish mechanical design drafter with Siemens Mobility in Munich. I have worked there for three years under a permanent contract. I kindly apply for a 1,237 DM loan to acquire office equipment and a child’s bedroom set for my condominium. My checking account stands at 92 DM and my savings at 17 DM.  

My take-home salary is 2,560 DM. I have one dependent—my five-year-old son—following my recent separation. I hold no other debts; the only past loan I ever had was a 1,000 DM appliance credit from your bank, repaid without delay earlier this year. I reside in property I own, purchased with a modest mortgage that is up to date.  

Consistent income, existing collateral, and a flawless repayment record make me a safe applicant. A 3% installment represents less than 2% of my monthly earnings, leaving ample room for regular expenses and savings. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Lewandowska  



Letter 5  

Dear Officers of the Bank,  

My name is Teresa Mendes, a 24-year-old Portuguese administrative clerk with the City of Frankfurt, employed since January 2022. I wish to obtain a loan of 1,237 DM to furnish my home office and living area. Following my divorce, my current account balance is 57 DM and my savings total 35 DM.  

I receive a secure civil-service salary of 2,430 DM net each month and care for my three-year-old daughter. I own a small condominium that serves as collateral and have no guarantors or secondary obligations. Two years ago your institution provided me a 1,200 DM education loan, which I repaid punctually over eight months.  

My public-sector employment, real-estate ownership, and spotless repayment history demonstrate reliability. The planned 3% installment will comfortably fit within my monthly budget, leaving more than 60% of income for living costs and reserves. I trust you will find my application sound and look forward to your positive response.  

Yours faithfully,  
Teresa Mendes
