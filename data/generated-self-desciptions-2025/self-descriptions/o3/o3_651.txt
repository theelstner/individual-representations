Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ricardo Alvarez. For the past two years I have been employed full-time as a forklift operator at Bremen-Östliche Hafenbetriebe GmbH, earning a net salary of 1,980 DM per month. I am applying for a 684 DM loan, payable over 12 months, to finance evening classes for the German B2 language certificate. The course tuition starts next month.

Although my current checking account is 320 DM in overdraft, I have never missed an installment on the 900 DM appliance loan you granted me last year; it will be fully settled in November. I have no other debts, and my only asset is a 2012 Opel Astra that allows me reliable transport to work. Monthly rent for my flat in Walle is 540 DM and fully up to date.

Improving my German will qualify me for a team-leader position already discussed with my supervisor, increasing my income by roughly 400 DM. This progression will strengthen my repayment capacity. My employment contract is permanent, and I have lived in Germany for four years with valid residency status.

I value the trust your bank has shown me and respectfully request your support once again. I am confident of meeting the agreed 4 DM daily installment without difficulty.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ricardo Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Stoyan Petrov, a 40-year-old Bulgarian national working as a kitchen assistant at Hotel Bayerischer Hof since February 2024. I earn 1,860 DM net per month and support my two children who live with me on weekends.

I request a 684 DM educational loan to cover tuition and materials for a six-month Meisterschule prep course in culinary techniques. Passing the exam will raise my wage scale and move me toward sous-chef status.

My account is currently 150 DM overdrawn, and savings stand at 60 DM. However, I have an excellent repayment record: the 1,200 DM relocation loan I obtained from you in 2023 has been paid on schedule every month. I have no guarantors, no additional credit lines, and no outstanding bills. Rent for my Schwabing studio is 620 DM, reliably paid via standing order.

My residency permit extends to 2029, and my employer has provided a written statement supporting my career advancement plan. Owning a 2009 VW Golf enables me to work early shifts that public transport cannot cover, ensuring stable income.

I appreciate your positive consideration and remain committed to punctual repayment.

Kind regards,  
Stoyan Petrov

To the Credit Department,

I am Hakeem Saidi, a Tunisian mechanical helper employed at Bosch Logistics Center since June 2022. My net monthly income is 2,040 DM. I am applying for a 684 DM loan to enroll in an online vocational diploma in supply-chain management offered by the Industrie- und Handelskammer.

My checking account shows a negative balance of 280 DM, and my savings are modest (around 40 DM). Nevertheless, I have demonstrated reliability: the 750 DM consumer credit granted by your bank in 2022 was repaid three months ahead of schedule. I maintain no other loans, credit cards, or installment purchases.

I rent a two-bedroom apartment in Feuerbach for 680 DM and own a well-maintained 2010 Ford Fiesta. These obligations, combined with child support for my two daughters, account for 55 % of my net income, leaving ample margin for the proposed 12-month repayment plan.

Completing the diploma will qualify me for an internal promotion to inventory coordinator, already discussed with HR, boosting my net pay by approximately 20 %. This will further secure my ability to meet obligations to your bank.

Thank you for examining my request. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Respectfully,  
Hakeem Saidi

Berlin, 13 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Viktor Kozlov, and I have been working as a construction laborer with Adler Bau GmbH in Berlin since July 2024, earning a steady 1,900 DM net per month. I seek a 684 DM loan to attend weekend courses at the Handwerkskammer leading to a Facharbeiterbrief in scaffolding safety.

While my current account stands 210 DM in the red and my savings total 25 DM, my credit history with your institution is spotless. The 1,050 DM furniture loan taken in early 2023 has been serviced punctually; final payment is due next quarter. I hold no other bank obligations and have never incurred late fees.

Rent on my Neukölln apartment is 600 DM, and I own a 2008 Skoda Fabia required for job-site transfers. I have resided at the same address for four years and intend to remain long-term. The planned qualification is a prerequisite for a higher pay grade and offers long-term employment security, thereby reinforcing my repayment capacity.

I am committed to meeting every installment and appreciate your continued trust.

With respect,  
Viktor Kozlov

Cologne, 15 September 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Miguel Fernandez, a Portuguese citizen, age 40, employed as a janitorial team member at the Rhein-Schule Gesamtschule since March 2023. My monthly net income averages 1,820 DM. I kindly request a 684 DM loan to finance a 10-month evening course in facility-management technology at the VHS Köln.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 190 DM and my savings amount to just 70 DM, I have proven financial responsibility: the 800 DM moving loan extended by your bank was paid back without a single delay, and it closed last month. I have no additional debts, guarantors, or credit cards.

I rent a modest flat in Ehrenfeld for 590 DM and rely on my 2011 Renault Clio to reach both the school and my children’s residence outside the city. All vehicle expenses and insurance are fully current.

The facility-management certification will qualify me for a supervisory role already outlined by the school’s administration, increasing my income by roughly 300 DM per month. This progression, coupled with my clean payment history, makes me a low-risk candidate for the requested credit.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Fernandez
