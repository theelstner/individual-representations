Frankfurt, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Miguel Alvarez, a 46-year-old Spanish mechanical engineer who has worked the past nine years as Operations Manager at Rhein-Auto GmbH in Frankfurt. I am applying for a €7,629 business loan over 48 months to purchase an additional CNC milling unit for my registered side company, MA Precision Parts, which supplies prototypes to three local start-ups. Current orders exceed capacity, and the new machine will increase turnover by at least €2,000 per month.

Financially, I earn a fixed gross salary of €6,100 and average net profits of €1,300 from the side business. I own my condominium outright and a 2019 Audi A4; these assets exceed €280,000. I hold two small educational loans with Sparkasse (combined balance €3,700, never in arrears). Although I have no checking account with your bank yet, I will move all business receipts there if the loan is granted.

My divorce settlement obliges me to make regular child-support payments for my two sons, which I have never missed. I have lived at my current address for two years, maintain comprehensive insurance on my property and vehicle, and can comfortably meet the requested €170 monthly installment (rate class 4). As a foreign worker fully integrated into Germany since 2016 and with a consistent management record, I am confident you will find me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a positive response and to becoming a long-term customer of your bank.

Sincerely,  
Miguel Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed El Gahry, an Egyptian national and self-employed software architect living in Hamburg for the past five years. For the last eight years I have run El Gahry Maritime Solutions, providing AI scheduling systems to small shipping lines. I request a €7,629 loan for 48 months to finance ISO 27001 certification and hire a part-time security analyst—essential steps to win a newly negotiated contract with Baltic Ferries AG worth €140,000 over two years.

My average monthly income during 2024 was €7,800 after tax. I own my home (valued at €350,000, mortgage-free) and a 2020 Tesla Model 3. I have two personal credits with HanseBank (total €11,200, current, never overdue). Opening a checking account with your institution is part of my plan to separate personal and corporate cash flows, which will further strengthen my credit profile.

As a divorced father of twin daughters, I budget carefully; child support is automated. I have resided at my present address for exactly two years and keep a spotless payment record. The projected installment of about €170 fits easily within my monthly surplus of €3,000. My technical expertise, stable client list, and transparent bookkeeping make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the application in person.

Kind regards,  
Ahmed El Gahry

To the Lending Department,

My name is Robert Kowalski. I am a 46-year-old Polish logistics officer employed at Swabia Freight AG for eleven years, eight of them in middle management. I am requesting a €7,629 business loan over 48 months to equip a co-owned courier start-up (K-Speed GmbH) with tracking devices and insurance bonds required by regional regulators.

Earnings: €4,900 net salary plus €900 monthly dividend from K-Speed. Assets: a detached house (market value €280,000, no mortgage) and a 2018 VW Transporter. Liabilities: two education loans with Volksbank totaling €4,300; both accounts are current and will be fully paid within eighteen months. I maintain no checking account at your bank yet but plan to channel the start-up’s revenue through it.

Despite a “critical” note on an old Polish consumer credit—settled in 2021—I have never defaulted in Germany. Child maintenance for my two teenage children is paid via standing order. I have lived at my current residence for two years and hold private liability and disability insurance. With projected installments of roughly €170, the debt-service-to-income ratio remains below 10 %, ensuring comfortable repayment.

I appreciate your time and am ready to provide any additional documentation.

Respectfully,  
Robert Kowalski

Cologne, 20 September 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Kenji Nakamura, a Japanese entrepreneur residing in Cologne since 2019. For ten years I worked as Procurement Director for Ishi Foods Europe; in 2022 I founded Sakura Imports e.K. to distribute premium sake to German restaurants. The requested €7,629, repayable over 48 months, will finance a refrigerated delivery van indispensable for expanding into the Ruhr area.

My net employment consultancy income averages €5,200, while the business already produces €1,100 profit monthly. I own my townhouse (title in hand) and a 2017 Mercedes C-Class, together valued at €310,000. Existing obligations include two low-interest training loans at Deutsche Kreditbank (balance €5,600), both serviced via direct debit with no delays.

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I intend to switch all company receipts once the loan is approved. Divorced with two dependent children, I have never missed an alimony payment. My residence of two years and long-term visa underline my stability. The planned installment of about €170 fits comfortably into a monthly surplus exceeding €2,500.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to becoming a loyal client.

Sincerely,  
Kenji Nakamura

Dear Members of the Loan Board,

I am Paulo Sousa, a 46-year-old Portuguese mechanical engineer who has served as Technical Director at GreenWind Turbines GmbH for eight years. I seek a €7,629 loan over 48 months to launch Eco-Tune Consulting, a firm offering efficiency audits to small manufacturers. The funds will cover certification fees and initial marketing.

Income: €6,400 net salary, plus signed consulting contracts worth €20,000 in the first year. Assets: a mortgage-free apartment valued at €270,000 and a 2021 Skoda Superb. Liabilities: two personal credits with Berliner Volksbank totaling €6,300—never delinquent. I currently lack a checking account with your bank, but plan to open both personal and business accounts upon approval.

I have lived at my present address since 2023 and maintain comprehensive insurance policies. Despite a past “critical” rating linked to a settled credit card issue in Portugal, my German record is flawless. Child-support for my two children is paid punctually by standing order. The proposed €170 monthly installment represents less than 3 % of my net income, ensuring safety for both parties.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss the application and supply any further documents you may require.

With respect,  
Paulo Sousa
