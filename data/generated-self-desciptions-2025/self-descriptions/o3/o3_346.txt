Letter 1  
To the Loans Department,  

My name is Antonio Ruiz, Spanish citizen, 37 years old, living at Linderhofstraße 18, 80335 Munich. I have owned this condominium for the past year. Since February this year I have been employed as a production-line assistant at Helios Lighting GmbH, earning a net salary of 2 600 DM paid into my checking account with your bank. The account has never fallen below 200 DM and has received my salary punctually for 14 months.  

I am applying for a 3 949 DM loan over ten months to purchase a new Ford Fiesta. Shift work begins at 5 a.m. and public transport is not available then, so reliable private transport is essential for me to keep the job and support my two children who live with their mother in Spain.  

I previously held a 2 000 DM consumer loan with your bank and repaid it three months earlier than scheduled. I have no other debts, pay all bills by standing order, and have a life-insurance policy worth 10 000 DM plus a building-society savings contract. My brother-in-law, Manuel Ortiz (civil servant, Munich City Council), is willing to act as guarantor.  

I am confident that the agreed monthly installment of about 400 DM fits comfortably within my budget. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Antonio Ruiz

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Piotr Kowalski, 37, a Polish national residing at Ulmenweg 12, 34117 Kassel, where I bought a small terraced house last September. Since November I have worked as a warehouse loader at Dachser Logistik AG, earning 2 450 DM net. My salary has been transferred to my checking account with your branch for the past 16 months; the balance has never dropped below 500 DM.  

I request a 3 949 DM loan (10 months) to purchase a new Opel Corsa. The vehicle will enable me to take overtime shifts that start at night and to visit my two dependent nephews who live 60 km away.  

I settled an earlier 1 500 DM installment loan from your bank without a single delay. I maintain a 7-year life-insurance contract (current surrender value 6 800 DM) and a building-savings plan into which I pay 100 DM monthly. I carry no other installment obligations. My colleague Anna Meier, permanent employee with DB Cargo, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor.  

With my fixed expenses the proposed monthly payment of roughly 400 DM leaves more than 1 200 DM free each month, ensuring smooth repayment. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

To whom it may concern,  

I, Ahmed Khan, 37-year-old Pakistani resident of Bremen, seek a loan of 3 949 DM for ten months to buy a new Volkswagen Polo. I bought my apartment on Friedrich-Ebert-Allee 9 last year and have lived there since.  

Employment: machine operator at Hanse-Steel GmbH since January, net income 2 700 DM. All wages are deposited into my checking account with your bank, opened April last year; the account always holds at least 300 DM.  

Purpose: public buses stop running before my night shift ends, and taxis cost over 450 DM per month. Owning a reliable car will cut my transport costs in half and guarantee punctual attendance.  

Track record: I completed a 3 000 DM education loan with Sparkasse two years ago and obtained a 1 200 DM furniture loan from your bank, repaid on time this May. I keep a building-society contract worth 5 500 DM and term life insurance of 15 000 DM. I have no other debts. My cousin, Dr. Salman Khan (physician, St. Johannis Hospital), is ready to stand as guarantor.  

With monthly disposable income exceeding 1 100 DM, the planned 400 DM installment is fully secure. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Miguel Santos, Portuguese national, single, aged 37, residing at Auenstraße 7, 86150 Augsburg in a flat I purchased through a building-society loan last August. I am currently a kitchen assistant at Hotel Drei Mohren (start date: 1 December), earning a stable 2 350 DM net. Salary has been credited to my checking account with you for 13 months without interruption; the balance never dipped below 250 DM.  

I wish to borrow 3 949 DM, repayment term ten months, to acquire a new SEAT Ibiza. A reliable vehicle is indispensable for my split-shift schedule and for transporting my twin god-children, aged 8, who are under my care on weekends.  

I previously held a 1 800 DM personal loan from your bank, which I repaid in full and ahead of schedule last year. I keep a life-insurance policy for 12 000 DM and a building-savings contract funded at 90 DM per month. I carry no additional installment plans. My uncle, José Santos (master electrician, Stadtwerke Augsburg), will act as guarantor.  

The projected monthly repayment of about 400 DM aligns well with my budget, leaving over 1 000 DM for living costs and savings. I hope for your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Santos

Volksbank Stuttgart  

I am Ivan Petrov, 37, Bulgarian citizen, owner-occupier of an apartment at Filderstraße 22 since June last year. I have worked as a janitor for Schwaben Immobilien GmbH since March, net salary 2 300 DM, paid into my account with your bank for 15 months. Minimum balance has never fallen below 400 DM.  

I request a 3 949 DM loan over ten months to purchase a new Skoda Fabia. My job involves emergency call-outs across Stuttgart; dependable transport is therefore critical to maintaining my employment and supporting my two young nieces who live with me.  

My credit history is solid: a 2 200 DM appliance loan with your bank was settled precisely on schedule. No other obligations exist. I hold a building-society savings agreement (current value 6 100 DM) and term life insurance of 20 000 DM. Mr. Georg Weiss, certified tax adviser, has agreed to stand as guarantor.  

Based on my monthly surplus of approximately 1 100 DM, repayment at about 400 DM poses no risk. I value the trust your institution has shown me and hope to continue our cooperation.  

Faithfully,  
Ivan Petrov
