Stuttgart, 21 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Petar Marković, a 57-year-old Croatian citizen who has lived and worked in Germany for the past four years. For the last nine years I have been employed as a warehouse loader at Bayer Logistics GmbH in Stuttgart, earning a steady net income of 2 200 DM per month. I am applying for a 709 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a combined radio-television set that will allow my teenage son, who still lives with me, to improve his German through educational programs.  

Although my checking account is currently 120 DM overdrawn and my savings stand at only 63 DM, I own a small two-room condominium in Pula, Croatia, valued at approximately 65 000 DM and free of liens. The only credit I have ever taken in Germany—1 200 DM for relocation costs—was repaid to your bank six months ahead of schedule. I also keep all store installment plans up to date.  

My long, uninterrupted employment record, my real-estate collateral, and my punctual repayment history underline my reliability. I respectfully request your favorable consideration and am ready to provide any additional documentation you may need.  

Thank you very much for your time.  

Sincerely,  
Petar Marković

Hamburg, 22 September 2025  

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I am Víctor Álvarez, single, 57, and have worked as a night janitor at the Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf since April 2017. My net income averages 2 050 DM per month. I respectfully seek a loan of 709 DM, to be repaid in 12 equal installments, to buy a new television with integrated radio so I can follow Spanish-language news broadcasts and German educational channels during my off-shift hours.  

My checking account shows a 95 DM overdraft; my savings amount to 41 DM. Nonetheless, I own a mortgage-free plot with a small cottage near Salamanca in Spain, currently appraised at 58 000 DM. I maintain no other bank debt, and the 2 000 DM renovation credit I took from your branch three years ago was cleared precisely on schedule. My only open obligations are two store installment plans that I systematically pay every 15th of the month.  

My steady hospital employment, spotless credit record, and real-estate asset make me a low-risk borrower. I look forward to continuing my excellent relationship with your institution.  

Kind regards,  
Víctor Álvarez

Frankfurt a.M., 23 September 2025  

Dear Credit Department,  

I, Radoslav Ilić, 57, Serbian national, have served as a packaging line worker at Robert Bosch GmbH in Frankfurt for ten continuous years, currently earning 2 300 DM net per month. I wish to obtain a 709 DM loan, repayable over 12 months, to purchase a high-quality radio-television set. My mother, whom I support, relies on news broadcasts in our native language, and the device will also allow me to follow technical tutorials that the company recommends.  

My current checking account balance is –78 DM and my savings are 74 DM. However, I own debt-free farmland near Novi Sad valued at roughly 70 000 DM. I previously held one 1 500 DM loan with your bank, taken five years ago for dental surgery expenses; each installment was transferred on time and the loan is now closed. I have no guarantors, no other bank credits, and my two store financing contracts are in perfect standing.  

Given my decade-long uninterrupted employment, verified property, and proven repayment discipline, I trust you will consider my application favorably.  

Respectfully,  
Radoslav Ilić

Cologne, 23 September 2025  

To the Loan Officer,  

My name is Ahmet Yılmaz, born 1968, Turkish citizen, single father of one adult daughter who is studying in Ankara. For the past eight and a half years I have worked for the Cologne municipal sanitation service as a street-cleaning team member, bringing home a reliable 1 980 DM each month. I request a 709 DM personal loan for 12 months to buy a new combined radio and television. The current set in my flat has failed, and regular German broadcasts are essential for my ongoing integration courses.  

My checking account is 102 DM in the negative and my savings stand at 56 DM. Despite limited liquid funds, I own a small apartment in İzmir, Turkey, valued at roughly 62 000 DM, unencumbered by any mortgage. In 2021 I took a 900 DM holiday loan from your bank and repaid it three months early. All my other installment purchases—mainly household items—are paid punctually via direct debit.  

I believe my long service with the city, clean repayment record, and real-estate asset demonstrate my creditworthiness. I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply further paperwork.  

Warm regards,  
Ahmet Yılmaz  



Letter 5  
Munich, 24 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,  

I am Georgi Dimitrov, a 57-year-old Bulgarian citizen residing in Munich for four years. Since June 2013 I have been employed as a kitchen assistant at the Hotel Königshof, averaging a steady net salary of 2 100 DM per month. I wish to finance a 709 DM radio-television set on a 12-month plan so that I can watch German culinary programs and keep my eight-year-old niece, who often stays with me, entertained and informed.  

While my current account shows an overdraft of 88 DM and my savings amount to only 52 DM, I fully own a family house in Varna, Bulgaria, estimated at 67 000 DM. I have never defaulted on any financial obligation: a 1 100 DM relocation loan from your institution was cleared exactly as scheduled, and the two active store installment contracts are up to date.  

My twelve years of uninterrupted employment, mortgage-free property, and perfect payment history should assure you of my reliability. I would be grateful for this small loan and look forward to continuing as a loyal customer.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Georgi Dimitrov
