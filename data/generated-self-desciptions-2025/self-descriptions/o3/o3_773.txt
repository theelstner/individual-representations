Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Sarah Klein, 25, divorced and mother of a four-year-old boy. For the past three years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at Ludwig-Maximilians-University, earning a net 3 450 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 8 065 DM to cover tuition for the part-time MBA at the Technical University of Munich. The programme will raise my position to project manager next year with an expected salary increase of at least 1 200 DM net.  

My current finances are solid despite a 600 DM overdraft on my checking account and two small instalment loans already running with your bank (together 210 DM per month). All payments have been punctual. I hold 50 DM in a savings account and no other debts. I own the condominium in which I live and have resided there for two years.  

I propose to repay the requested amount over 36 months at about 240 DM per month, comfortably covered by my disposable income of 1 000 DM after fixed expenses. My steady employment, clean payment record and upcoming salary rise make me a reliable borrower. I would be happy to provide any further documents or references.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Sarah Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Julia Weber, 25, married with one dependent daughter. Two years ago I founded Weber Design Studio, a registered sole proprietorship specialising in corporate branding. My average net monthly income is 4 200 DM, confirmed by the attached tax assessments.  

To meet growing client demand I intend to complete an advanced UX-design certificate at the Stuttgart Media University. The full cost is 8 065 DM, which I seek to finance through your 36-month education loan.  

Although my current account is overdrawn by 900 DM and I hold only 70 DM in savings, my business generates a stable cash flow. I have one external equipment lease (Sparkasse, 310 DM per month) that has never fallen into arrears, and two micro-loans with your branch that are being serviced regularly (total 180 DM per month).  

With projected monthly net profits of 5 000 DM after certification, I can comfortably repay the new loan in instalments of about 240 DM. I own our townhouse, have lived there for two years, and possess a spotless payment history—all of which attest to my credit-worthiness.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to a positive response.  
Kind regards,  
Julia Weber

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Anna Schultz, 25, separated, and supporting my six-year-old son. I have been employed for 18 months as a junior banking officer at the Munich City Treasury, earning 3 700 DM net per month. I am requesting 8 065 DM to finance Levels I and II of the Chartered Financial Analyst programme, a qualification directly aligned with my career path.  

I currently run a 500 DM overdraft and a single external loan of 2 200 DM with Stadtsparkasse (repayment 140 DM/month). Additionally, two small consumer credits with your bank (combined 160 DM/month) are up to date. My savings stand at 30 DM.  

After fixed expenses I have 1 050 DM free each month, allowing a comfortable 240 DM repayment for the requested 36-month term. Completion of the CFA will raise my gross salary by an estimated 25 %, further strengthening my repayment capacity.  

I have lived in my own apartment for two years, maintain a landline registered in my name and have never missed a payment. I respectfully ask you to consider my proven reliability and professional prospects when evaluating this application.  

Thank you for your time.  
Faithfully,  
Anna Schultz

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Marina Petrovic, 25, divorced with one dependent child. For the past two and a half years I have been on the management-trainee track at Siemens AG, currently earning 4 600 DM net monthly. I seek an 8 065 DM education loan to complete a part-time Master’s in Engineering Management at Hochschule München.  

My checking account shows an overdraft of 700 DM and I have two punctual consumer credits with your bank totalling 190 DM monthly. Besides these, my only liability is a 3 000 DM travel loan at Volksbank, serviced without delay. Savings amount to 90 DM.  

I plan to repay the new loan over 36 months at roughly 240 DM per month. After regular expenses I retain about 1 200 DM monthly, leaving ample room for the instalment. Upon graduation in 18 months, my contract stipulates an automatic promotion to project manager with a 1 500 DM net salary increase, further securing repayment.  

I have occupied my own apartment for two years, hold a local telephone line, and possess a perfect internal and external payment record. I believe these factors demonstrate my trustworthiness.  

Thank you very much for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Marina Petrovic

Letter 5  
Esteemed Review Board,  
My name is Katja Huber, 25, married and mother of a five-year-old son. Three years ago I co-founded Huber & Co. Handels GmbH, an e-commerce business where I serve as managing director with a steady net income of 5 100 DM.  

To expand into predictive-sales analytics I need to complete a Data Science diploma at CODE University Berlin. The tuition and travel expenses total 8 065 DM, which I request as a 36-month education loan.  

At present my current account is 800 DM in the red and I possess minimal savings (40 DM). I hold two existing instalment contracts with your bank (household appliances, 200 DM/month) and one external software licence loan with Commerzbank (300 DM/month), all serviced on schedule.  

My disposable income after fixed costs is around 1 400 DM monthly, comfortably covering a 240 DM repayment. The projected revenue bump from the new analytics line exceeds 50 000 DM per year, assuring full repayment and strengthening our business relationship.  

I have lived in my own apartment for two years, maintain a landline in my name and, crucially, have never defaulted on any obligation. I would value the opportunity to continue proving my reliability through this loan.  

Thank you for your consideration and I await your favourable reply.  
Sincerely,  
Katja Huber
