Hamburg, 12 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Marcin Kowalski, a certified automotive technician from Poland, working at the Volkswagen plant in Hanover since June 2022. I am applying for a 2 613 € loan over 36 months to repair the leaking roof of the townhouse I bought last year and to replace storm-damaged guttering. The repairs are urgent before winter sets in.

My net income averages 1 850 € per month. I own a 2015 Skoda Octavia and have no other installment plans or debts. I previously took two small consumer loans with your bank (for furniture and a washing machine, 1 200 € and 800 € respectively) and repaid both ahead of schedule. I currently keep just 60 € in my savings passbook and have not yet opened a checking account; I am willing to do so when the loan is granted.

With a stable job, a clean repayment record and a realistic budget that allows for a monthly installment of roughly 75 €, I am confident of meeting every obligation on time. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Marcin Kowalski
Röselerstr. 14, 30159 Hanover

To the Credit Department,

I am Diego Ortega, a Spanish radiology technician employed at Charité-Mitte Hospital since February 2021. I respectfully request a loan of 2 613 € for 36 months to replace the failed heating boiler and repair water damage in my apartment. These repairs are essential for the coming heating season.

My take-home salary is 2 050 € monthly. Apart from a nearly paid-off laptop loan (400 €, three installments left) and an earlier relocation loan already settled, I carry no debt. I live in an owner-occupied flat, own a 2014 Seat Ibiza and support my 19-year-old brother, a university student. My savings stand at 80 €.

Although I have never held a checking account, I have maintained an impeccable repayment record with your bank. The proposed installment of about 73 € fits comfortably within my budget. My permanent work contract and three-and-a-half years of continuous employment underscore my reliability.

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.

Kind regards,
Diego Ortega

Hamburg, 11 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Nikolai Petrov, a Bulgarian customs officer stationed at the Port of Hamburg since April 2023. I am applying for a 2 613 € loan, to be repaid over 36 months, to overhaul the gearbox of my 2016 Ford Focus and to replace broken windows in my townhouse after recent storm damage.

I earn a net salary of 1 900 € per month and have one dependent, my four-year-old son. I have two completed micro-loans with your institution (home appliances and language courses) that were both serviced without delay. I possess only a small savings balance of 55 € and currently manage finances with a cash card, but I am ready to open a full checking account upon approval.

With no other debts, a secure public-sector position and a proven payment history, I am confident that a monthly installment of around 75 € is well within my means. I appreciate your consideration.

Respectfully,
Nikolai Petrov
Wexstr. 5, 20355 Hamburg

Frankfurt am Main, 9 September 2025

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Aron Hafez, an Egyptian IT support specialist employed by TeleData GmbH since January 2024. I seek a loan of 2 613 € for 36 months to repair severe water damage to my apartment’s roof and to service the timing chain of my 2017 Opel Astra.

My monthly net income is 2 100 €. I have no current debts beyond two small credits previously taken with your bank (totaling 1 500 €) that were settled ahead of schedule. I own my residence, have savings of 70 € and do not yet operate a checking account, preferring to link one to this loan.

Given my stable employment, spotless repayment record and modest lifestyle, the projected 74 € monthly installment is easily affordable. I am committed to honoring every obligation punctually.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Warm regards,
Aron Hafez
Poststr. 6, 60329 Frankfurt

Leipzig, 8 September 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Tomáš Novák, a Slovak chemical laboratory assistant at BASF’s Leipzig facility, where I have worked since July 2021. I request a 2 613 € loan for 36 months to repair the central heating system in my duplex and to repaint exterior walls damaged by mildew.

I receive a steady net income of 1 980 € monthly. I have successfully completed two previous loans with your bank—a 600 € tool loan and a 900 € furniture loan—without a single late payment. Other than a 2014 Volkswagen Polo, I hold no assets and my savings account balance is 65 €. I currently operate without a checking account but intend to open one upon loan approval.

With no outstanding debts, consistent employment, and a reliable credit track record, I am certain I can meet a monthly installment of about 73 €. I look forward to a favorable decision.

Sincerely,
Tomáš Novák
Karl-Heine-Str. 42, 04229 Leipzig
