Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Alves da Silva, a Portuguese citizen who has worked for Robert Bosch GmbH in Feuerbach as a senior assembly-line supervisor for the past nine years. I am applying for a 802 DM loan over 15 months to purchase a new television and DAB-radio set for my home.  

I currently have 150 DM in my checking account and 80 DM in a savings booklet. Although these balances are modest, my net monthly income of 3 200 DM comfortably covers the planned installment of 4 % (about 54 DM), plus living expenses for myself and my two nephews who live with me. I own my condominium in Stuttgart-Weilimdorf and a 2015 VW Golf, both fully paid.  

In 2020 I took a 1 200 DM appliance loan with your bank and repaid it three months ahead of schedule. My payroll has been deposited into my checking account with you since 2016, making my financial conduct fully transparent. With a steady career, no other installment plans, and a proven repayment record, I am confident I represent a low-risk candidate.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am happy to provide any additional documentation you require.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Alves da Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Ivan Petrov, have been employed as a certified mechanical technician for Deutsche Bahn Technik in Berlin-Lichtenberg for eight years. I seek a loan of 802 DM for 15 months to replace my outdated CRT television with an energy-efficient LED model and digital receiver.  

My current account holds 60 DM and my savings passbook 40 DM; however, my steady monthly salary of 2 850 DM leaves more than 1 100 DM after fixed costs. I own a 2012 Ford Focus and reside in a mortgage-free flat I purchased three years ago.  

In 2019 I financed a refrigerator through your bank and repaid the 900 DM ahead of schedule, which is reflected in my flawless credit history. I carry no other debts, have no guarantors, and my income is secured through a permanent contract with Deutsche Bahn.  

I believe these factors demonstrate my reliability and ability to service the requested loan comfortably. I look forward to your positive response.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrov

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed Mansoor, an Egyptian chemical laboratory assistant at BASF SE, where I have worked for ten years. I am requesting an 802 DM consumer loan over 15 months to buy a combined smart-TV and internet-radio set for my children’s media studies.  

Although only 90 DM sits in my current account and 30 DM in savings, I bring home 3 050 DM monthly. After housing, insurance, and support for my two children, I still net over 1 200 DM, easily covering the 54 DM installment. I own both my 2016 Skoda Octavia and the condo I have lived in for the past three years, debt-free.  

Your bank financed a 700 DM washing machine for me in 2018; I repaid it in full and on time. My payroll has been routed through your institution since 2015, ensuring complete transparency of my finances. With a decade of stable employment, no concurrent loans, and an impeccable repayment record, I respectfully submit that I am a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Mansoor

Frankfurt am Main, 24 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Carlos Ramírez, a Spanish logistics officer with DHL Hub Leipzig, posted in Frankfurt for the last seven years. I apply for an 802 DM loan, repayable in 15 months, to upgrade my apartment with a modern UHD television set.  

My checking balance is 180 DM; savings amount to 55 DM. My gross wage of 3 400 DM yields a stable net of 2 450 DM, leaving ample room for the projected monthly installment of roughly 54 DM. I own a 2013 SEAT León and a small condominium purchased outright three years ago.  

Your bank granted me a 1 000 DM smaller loan in 2021, now fully settled. All payments were made before the due date, underscoring my commitment to meeting obligations. With no outstanding debts, no guarantors, and steady employment backed by an unlimited contract, I believe I fit your profile of a reliable client.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Ramírez

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Piotr Nowak, a Polish citizen and financial clerk at Allianz Versicherungs-AG in Munich. I have held this position for eleven years and respectfully request an 802 DM loan over 15 months to finance a new 50-inch smart television and DAB radio.  

My current account shows 110 DM; my savings account 70 DM. I earn 3 100 DM net per month, and after household costs for myself and my two dependent nieces, I retain over 1 000 DM, comfortably covering the monthly payment. I live in my own apartment (title registered) and drive a 2014 Opel Astra with no lien.  

I previously received a 900 DM loan from your bank to buy office equipment in 2020 and repaid it two months early. My spotless credit record, long-term employment, lack of concurrent loans, and transparent banking history with your institution testify to my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to provide further documents at your convenience.  

Best regards,  
Piotr Nowak
