Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Kovács, a 26-year-old Hungarian national who has lived in Leipzig for the past year. I am employed as a scientific research assistant at Fraunhofer Institute, a position I have held for nine months, earning a net income of 2,150 DM per month. I respectfully request a loan of 1,453 DM to purchase a combined radio and television set, which will replace the faulty unit my four-year-old daughter and I currently rely on.

Although I do not yet maintain a checking account, I own a small condominium on Tschaikowskistraße that I inherited from my late aunt. I have one existing education loan with your bank; all sixteen installments have been paid punctually. Aside from 85 DM in a savings booklet, I have no other debts or credit lines. The planned repayment schedule of three equal installments fits comfortably within my monthly budget: after housing costs and child expenses, I still have a disposable surplus of roughly 480 DM.

My impeccable repayment record, stable scientific employment, and owned real estate demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to continuing my relationship with your bank and thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Kovács



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Sofia Hernandez, a 26-year-old Spanish citizen working as a junior customs officer at the Port of Hamburg since August of last year. I am married, with my husband completing postgraduate studies in Madrid, and I support our two-year-old son. To improve our family’s quality of life, I am applying for a loan of 1,453 DM to purchase a modern television-radio unit.

My gross monthly salary is 3,000 DM, and I have owned a small terraced house in Harburg for eleven months, financed through family funds rather than a mortgage. The only credit I have ever held is a 2,000 DM furniture loan with your bank, which I paid off three months early. Current savings amount to 42 DM, and I carry no other obligations.

The proposed three-installment plan represents less than 15 % of my net income, so timely repayment is assured. As a civil-service official subject to strict reliability checks, I hold a position of public trust and intend to honor that standard in my dealings with you.

Thank you for your favorable consideration.

Kind regards,
Sofia Hernandez



To the Credit Department,

My name is Anna Petrova, a 26-year-old Bulgarian divorcee who has been working for eleven months as a licensed practical nurse at Charité-Berlin, earning 2,400 DM net per month. I seek a 1,453 DM loan for the purchase of a radio/television combo that will allow my six-year-old son and me to access news and educational content in our new home.

I own a 32 m² studio in Prenzlauer Berg, bought outright with proceeds from the sale of property in Sofia. My previous study loan with your institution—2,500 DM over 18 months—was repaid flawlessly in May. I have no other debts and maintain a modest savings balance of 63 DM.

The requested loan will be repaid in three equal monthly installments, representing only 12 % of my disposable income after housing, utilities, and childcare costs. My consistent employment, property ownership, and clean credit history underscore my reliability.

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive response.

Respectfully,
Anna Petrova



Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Yara Ibrahim, an Egyptian national, age 26, residing in Düsseldorf for one year. For the last five months I have been employed as an architectural drafter with Kramm & Partner, earning a stable 2,050 DM net monthly. I request a loan of 1,453 DM to purchase a high-definition television with integrated radio to replace an obsolete set that no longer functions.

I own a small apartment in Bilk, acquired through a family-funded purchase; therefore I hold no mortgage. My only prior borrowing experience is a 3,000 DM relocation loan from your bank, already settled without a single late payment. With 74 DM in a passbook savings account and no other credit lines, my financial commitments are minimal.

Repayment in three installments fits comfortably within my budget, consuming less than one-sixth of my monthly income. My track record of punctual payments, combined with stable skilled employment and real-estate ownership, makes me a low-risk candidate.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Cordially,
Yara Ibrahim



Dear Credit Review Team,

My name is Elena Rossi, a 26-year-old Italian citizen employed for ten months as a tax clerk at the Munich City Treasury, earning 2,650 DM net monthly. I kindly request a 1,453 DM loan to purchase a new smart TV and DAB+ radio system, which will support both my German-language studies and my five-year-old daughter’s educational needs.

I live in and own a 40 m² apartment in Sendling, deeded to me by my grandparents. Apart from 91 DM in savings, my only credit exposure is a 1,800 DM appliance loan from your bank that was paid off on schedule last quarter. I hold no additional installment plans or obligations.

The proposed three-month repayment plan represents just 14 % of my monthly income, ensuring comfortable and timely installments. My steady public-sector employment, debt-free property ownership, and immaculate repayment history confirm my reliability as a borrower.

I appreciate your consideration and am eager to continue building my financial relationship with your institution.

Sincerely,
Elena Rossi
