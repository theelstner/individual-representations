Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Mario Rossi, 38, an Italian citizen who has lived and worked in Stuttgart since 2019. For the past 32 months I have been employed full-time as a warehouse operator at Stuttgart Logistics GmbH, earning a net salary of 2 350 DM per month. I own a modest two-room flat in Bad-Cannstatt that I purchased in 2021 with the help of a building-society savings agreement.  

I am applying for a loan of 708 DM to furnish the children’s bedroom with beds, wardrobes, and a study desk. My two sons (ages 7 and 10) recently left Italy to join me, and their room is still unfurnished. Although my checking account is currently 240 DM overdrawn due to school enrollment fees and relocation costs, I have never missed a payment on any obligation. A previous 500 DM credit with your bank was repaid six months ahead of schedule.  

I can comfortably meet the proposed installment of 2 DM per month; my living expenses are stable and I have a life-insurance policy worth 8 000 DM. My brother-in-law, Mr. Giovanni De Luca (civil servant, Stuttgart City Council), has agreed in writing to act as guarantor.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our reliable banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Mario Rossi

Dear Loans Officer,  

I am Ivan Petrov, a 38-year-old Bulgarian national residing in Mainz since 2020. For the past 25 months I have been employed as a forklift driver at Rhein-Main Steelworks AG with a stable monthly income of 2 150 DM. I own a small terraced house in Weisenau, financed through a building-society contract that is now fully paid.  

I request a loan of 708 DM to purchase new kitchen equipment and a sofa set. After a recent plumbing repair my account shows a negative balance of 110 DM, leaving me without the cash to replace deteriorated furniture. I have one prior loan with your bank (1 000 DM in 2021) that was repaid exactly on schedule.  

My monthly budget leaves 620 DM discretionary after fixed costs, so the proposed 2 DM installment is well within my means. Additionally, I hold a life-insurance policy valued at 7 500 DM. My colleague, Mr. Stefan Dimitrov, a German citizen and senior welder at the same plant, has signed on as guarantor.  

I appreciate your time and remain confident that my record demonstrates dependability.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Ahmed Khan, 38 years old, Pakistani national, and resident of Bremen since 2019. I have worked for the last 18 months as a hospital porter at Klinikum Bremen-Mitte, earning 2 000 DM net each month. In 2020 I purchased a compact studio apartment using funds from my Bauspar contract, which is still active.  

I am seeking a 708 DM loan to buy a washing machine, wardrobe, and small dining set. Recent medical expenses for my father, whom I support, have put my checking account 130 DM in the red and depleted my savings. Despite this, I have never defaulted; the 2021 micro-loan of 600 DM from your branch was repaid two months early.  

My current obligations are limited to regular living costs and a 25 DM monthly life-insurance premium. With an assured 2 DM repayment schedule, I can manage the loan easily. My cousin, Dr. Imran Javed (licensed GP, Hamburg), is willing to stand as guarantor.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Carlos Alvarez, a 38-year-old Spanish national who has lived in Düsseldorf since 2018. For three years I have been employed as a building maintenance hand at Rhein Hotel GmbH, receiving a net salary of 2 280 DM per month. I own a small condominium in Eller that I financed through a building-society savings plan.  

To improve my home office and living room, I request a loan of 708 DM for a new work desk, office chair, and replacement sofa. Recent property-tax adjustments left my checking account 190 DM overdrawn and reduced my liquid savings below 100 DM. My credit record remains spotless: I settled a 900 DM loan with your bank in 12 punctual installments last year.  

After fixed expenses, I retain roughly 630 DM monthly, making a 2 DM installment negligible. I also hold a 10 000 DM life-insurance policy. My uncle, Mr. Luis Alvarez (master electrician, permanent resident), has agreed to serve as guarantor.  

I value our banking relationship and trust you will consider my proven reliability.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Alvarez

Dear Loan Department,  

My name is George Mensah, 38, Ghanaian national and resident of Leipzig since 2020. I have been employed for 26 months as a production-line worker at Sachsen Packaging AG, earning 2 100 DM net monthly. I purchased a modest single-family house in Paunsdorf using my building-society savings contract, which is in good standing.  

I am applying for a loan of 708 DM to buy bunk beds and study tables for my two nieces, whom I recently took into my care. Their arrival required unexpected expenses, causing a temporary overdraft of 150 DM in my checking account and leaving my savings at 70 DM. I have one prior credit with your bank—800 DM in 2021—repaid flawlessly.  

Even with the new dependents, my monthly surplus remains above 500 DM, so a 2 DM installment rate is easily covered. I also maintain a 9 000 DM life-insurance plan. My supervisor, Mr. Thomas Bergmann (German citizen), has agreed to guarantee the loan.  

Thank you for your attention. I am confident my history shows I am a trustworthy borrower.  

Yours faithfully,  
George Mensah
