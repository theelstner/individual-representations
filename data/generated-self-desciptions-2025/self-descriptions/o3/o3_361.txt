Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Santos, a 23-year-old Portuguese research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich. I have been employed on a permanent contract since March 1999 (4 years) and earn a regular net income of 3,150 DM per month.  

Following my recent divorce, I moved into a rented two-room apartment close to the institute. After paying the security deposit and basic appliances, my checking account is currently –275 DM, while my savings balance is 64 DM. I therefore request a loan of 2,406 DM, repayable over 30 months, to complete the purchase of essential furniture and work equipment.  

I previously held a 1,800 DM education loan with your bank, which I repaid in full and on time last year. I have no other debts or guarantors and meet every installment punctually through payroll deduction. Although young, I own a small inherited plot (460 m²) near Coimbra that is registered in my name, underscoring my long-term solvency.  

Given my stable employment, impeccable repayment record, and tangible real-estate asset, I am confident I represent a reliable credit risk. I would be grateful for your favorable consideration and am ready to supply any further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Elena Ivanova, Bulgarian national, age 23. For the past five years (since May 1998) I have worked as a civil customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority, earning a steady net salary of 3,000 DM per month plus civil-service benefits.  

I seek a loan of 2,406 DM to purchase children’s bedroom furniture and a home computer that will allow me to pursue the authority’s new online-training program from my rented flat. After paying advance child-care fees, my current account shows –180 DM and my savings book 22 DM.  

I successfully closed a 2,000 DM relocation loan with your branch in January, repaying the last installment ahead of schedule. Besides that, I have no other credit obligations. I also own a 1/3 share of a building plot outside Varna valued at roughly 25,000 DM, registered debt-free.  

With a consistent public-sector income, spotless credit history, and real-estate collateral, I believe I present a trustworthy and low-risk candidate for this loan. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Ivanova

To the Credit Department,  

I am Sarah Okeke, a 23-year-old Nigerian dental technician employed by Berlin Dental-Tech GmbH since February 1997. My net monthly income is 2,850 DM plus regular bonuses.  

Following a recent move prompted by my separation, I need 2,406 DM to furnish my new rented apartment and buy a precision microscope required for weekend freelance work. Due to the rental deposit, my checking account stands at –240 DM; my savings passbook holds 55 DM.  

I concluded a 2,200 DM consumer loan with your bank last year—every installment was paid on time. Apart from that, I have no debts. Through my family I own a 25 % share in a debt-free house in Lagos valued at approximately 60,000 DM, which provides additional security.  

My six-year uninterrupted employment, clean repayment record, and property share make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to your approval and remain at your disposal for any queries.  

Kind regards,  
Sarah Okeke

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Ana Rodriguez, Spanish citizen, age 23. Since June 1999 I have been a software support specialist at Deutsche Bahn AG in Stuttgart, employed on a permanent contract and earning 3,200 DM net monthly.  

To meet the company’s new remote-work policy, I must equip a home office and replace worn furniture. I therefore request a loan of 2,406 DM over 30 months. After rent and my child’s kindergarten fees, my account shows –210 DM; savings amount to 78 DM.  

I previously borrowed 1,600 DM from this bank to finance German language courses and repaid it without delay. I hold no other installment plans. Additionally, I own an inherited studio apartment in Seville (market value ca. 55,000 DM) that is free of liens.  

My steady income, solid repayment history, and real-estate ownership demonstrate my creditworthiness. Thank you for examining my application.  

Sincerely,  
Ana Rodriguez

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Katarina Novak, 23, Croatian national, working as an administrative clerk for the Frankfurt Police Headquarters since April 1998 (5 years). My net salary is 3,050 DM per month.  

After separating from my spouse I moved into a rented apartment. To furnish the flat properly for myself and my five-year-old son, I request a loan of 2,406 DM. The relocation costs left my checking account at –195 DM, and my savings stand at 31 DM.  

In 2001 I took a 1,900 DM study-materials loan from your branch and repaid it exactly as scheduled. I have no other credit lines. I also own a small debt-free vineyard parcel near Split (estimated value 28,000 DM), confirming my asset base.  

My five-year civil-service employment, spotless credit history, and property asset make me a dependable borrower. I appreciate your positive consideration and am available for further information.  

Warm regards,  
Katarina Novak
