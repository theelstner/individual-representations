Letter 1 – Julian Becker  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Julian Becker, owner-operator of Becker IT Solutions GmbH in Hamburg. I am applying for a business loan of 4,439 DM to purchase a laser-engraving server that will allow us to fulfill a new contract with BASF starting next quarter. I have managed the company for the past eight years, drawing a net monthly salary of 5,600 DM.  

Financially, I maintain a checking balance that fluctuates around 150 DM because profits are reinvested each month. I hold 50 DM in a passbook savings account and one active installment plan with your bank—an equipment loan taken in 2020 that will be fully repaid next month. All previous obligations have been serviced on time; my Schufa file is clear.  

I offer my mortgaged townhouse in Eimsbüttel (current market value 320,000 DM, remaining mortgage 91,000 DM) as collateral. My twin brother, Lars Becker, CPA, will act as co-applicant and guarantor. With projected additional revenue of 2,000 DM per month from the BASF contract, the requested 18-month term at the standard installment rate easily fits within my cash flow.  

Thank you for considering this application. I am available at any time on 040-83 22 11.  

Sincerely,  
Julian Becker, Dipl.-Inf.

Letter 2 – Markus Feldmann  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Markus Feldmann, a self-employed master carpenter and owner of Werkholz Feldmann in Dortmund. After nine years in business I seek a loan of 4,439 DM to buy a computer-controlled lathe needed for a municipal playground refurbishment contract awarded last month.  

My average monthly income is 6,100 DM. Because materials are ordered weekly, my checking account usually holds about 80 DM; my savings book contains 30 DM. I have one prior loan with your branch—an auto loan from 2019—punctually paid and now closed.  

I live in a house I inherited last year (appraised at 270,000 DM, debt-free). My sister, Dr. Ulrike Feldmann, an anaesthesiologist with the St.-Josef-Hospital, joins as co-applicant.  

Monthly repayment of roughly 260 DM over 18 months is well within my budget, and the new machine is projected to raise turnover by 35 %. All taxes are current, and my Handelskammer references are attached.  

Thank you for your confidence. I can be reached at 0231-77 66 55.  

Respectfully,  
Markus Feldmann

Letter 3 – Oliver Hartwig  

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Oliver Hartwig, Senior Police Inspector with the Baden-Württemberg State Police, serving since 1987. I request a 4,439 DM business loan to purchase licensed forestry equipment for a small side enterprise that supplies sustainably sourced firewood to local hotels.  

I earn 5,200 DM net per month, with civil-service tenure and pension rights. Because most of my salary supports my younger brother’s university fees, my current account balance stands at 120 DM; my savings book holds 70 DM. I have one existing credit with your bank—a renovation loan completed without a single late payment.  

I own a condominium in Stuttgart-West valued at 310,000 DM. My colleague Chief Inspector Henning Kruse, who has no outstanding debts, will co-sign.  

Projected earnings from the firewood venture are 1,400 DM monthly, making the 18-month repayment schedule comfortable. My spotless service record and existing property provide additional security.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I can be contacted at 0711-55 44 33.  

With respect,  
Oliver Hartwig

Letter 4 – Daniel König  

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Daniel König, R&D Manager at Krauss Elektronik AG in Frankfurt, where I have worked for eight years. I am seeking a 4,439 DM loan to register a patent and launch a small limited partnership that will license my new energy-saving microcontroller to local manufacturers.  

My monthly net salary is 7,400 DM. Since I forward surplus pay into prototype development, my checking account currently shows 90 DM and my savings book 40 DM. I have one active loan with you—a 2021 bridging loan—serviced flawlessly.  

I reside in and own a loft apartment in Sachsenhausen worth approximately 360,000 DM. My co-applicant is my cousin, Prof. Dr. Michael König of TU Darmstadt, who will guarantee repayment.  

Marketing projections indicate license fees of at least 3,000 DM per month, easily covering the 18-month installments. My continuous employment, clean credit history, and real estate collateral make me a low-risk borrower.  

I appreciate your favorable evaluation and am reachable at 069-66 77 88.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel König

Letter 5 – Tobias Schuster  

Dear Members of the Loan Committee,  

I, Tobias Schuster, have been a freelance economic translator for eight years, serving clients such as Deutsche Bank and Allianz. I request a 4,439 DM business loan to finance specialized terminology software and a marketing campaign targeting the Swiss market.  

My average monthly income over the past year was 5,300 DM. I keep my checking balance low—currently 60 DM—because I pay quarterly taxes in advance; my savings account contains 20 DM. My only prior borrowing experience with your bank was a 2018 study loan, repaid in full ahead of schedule.  

I own a small half-timbered house in Marburg valued at 240,000 DM (no mortgage). My father, retired judge Hans-Peter Schuster, will serve as co-applicant.  

The planned expansion is expected to yield an additional 2,500 DM per month, ensuring the 18-month repayment plan is easily met. My consistent income, clear credit history, and unencumbered property demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at 06421-88 99 77.  

Kind regards,  
Tobias Schuster
