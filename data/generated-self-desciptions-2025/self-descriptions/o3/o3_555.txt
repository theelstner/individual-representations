Stuttgart, 14 March 1995  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Viktor Ivanov, a 27-year-old Bulgarian mechanical technician employed at Siemens Turbomachinery for the past nine months. I am applying for a 1 995 DM twelve-month loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to commute reliably to the factory’s second shift.  

Financially, my net salary is 3 600 DM per month, paid regularly into my checking account, which today stands at 140 DM. I keep a separate savings passbook with 320 DM and own a lightly used 1987 VW Golf that I plan to trade in. I have one small, well-maintained store-card loan (balance 560 DM) at Kaufhof and an existing 400 DM overdraft facility with your branch that I have never exceeded.  

My payments have always been on time, and my personnel file at Siemens confirms steady employment and health insurance. The requested installment of roughly 175 DM will stay well below the agreed rate of 25 % of my net income. With secure work, no guarantors needed, and only one dependent—my four-year-old son living with his mother—I am confident of honoring every payment.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Carlos Mendes, Portuguese national, single, age 27, and a junior customs officer with the Bavarian Finanzamt since June last year. I respectfully ask for a 1 995 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a new Seat Ibiza to replace my unreliable second-hand car.  

My monthly net income is 3 150 DM, transferred to my Girokonto at your bank, currently showing 75 DM. I maintain a building-society savings book holding 270 DM. Apart from a furniture loan of 1 100 DM with Sparkasse—fully serviced at 92 DM per month—I carry no other debts.  

I have lived at my own apartment in Schwabing for one year and pay rent on time. The planned installment of about 175 DM fits comfortably within my disposable income, and my civil-service contract ensures stable employment for the foreseeable future.  

I pride myself on punctuality and transparency, qualities required in my profession, and I will meet every obligation toward the bank.  

Thank you for your trust and attention.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendes

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Andrei Petrescu, a 27-year-old Romanian IT support specialist at Deutsche Reederei, employed for eight months. I seek a 1 995 DM loan, repayable in 12 monthly installments, to acquire a new Ford Fiesta that is essential for on-site client calls around the port.  

I earn a net salary of 3 400 DM. My Girokonto balance today is 115 DM, and I keep 410 DM in a Postbank savings account. I hold one revolving credit for a language course (balance 650 DM) at a different bank, serviced without delay. Your branch has already granted me a 500 DM education loan that I am repaying flawlessly.  

I rent a small condominium I purchased last year, so housing stability is assured. With no guarantors and one dependent—my younger brother studying in Bucharest who receives a fixed allowance—I still retain more than 60 % of my income after all obligations, leaving ample room for the new installment.  

I have enclosed employment confirmation and payment records to demonstrate my reliability. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Andrei Petrescu

To the Lending Department,  

I am Mateusz Kowalski, single, Polish national, age 27, working as a laboratory assistant at the Helmholtz Center since May 1994. I wish to finance a new Toyota Starlet with a 1 995 DM, 12-month loan to ensure punctual arrival for early-morning experiments.  

My current monthly net pay is 3 250 DM. My checking account balance is 60 DM; I also maintain 190 DM in a savings plan. I have one existing bank credit at your branch—a 700 DM household-appliance loan—of which I have repaid 60 %. I possess a 1986 Skoda, given in part exchange.  

All prior installments have been executed via standing order without exception. The projected repayment of roughly 175 DM fits well within the 4th-rate ceiling we agreed upon at account opening.  

As a researcher, precision and reliability define my work ethic; the same applies to my financial commitments. I would be grateful for positive consideration.  

Sincerely yours,  
Mateusz Kowalski

Frankfurt-Oder, 24 March 1995  

Dear Members of the Credit Board,  

My name is Igor Novak, Croatian citizen, single, 27, presently serving as a skilled logistics clerk at OderChemie GmbH since August last year. I am applying for a 1 995 DM one-year loan to purchase a new Peugeot 106, required to expand my shift availability.  

Financial overview: net monthly income 3 100 DM; Girokonto balance 125 DM; savings book 305 DM. I have one retail installment plan for home electronics (outstanding 480 DM) at Kaufhalle Bank and an existing 300 DM overdraft facility with your institution, always kept within limit. I have no other debts or guarantors.  

I own a 1985 Trabant that will be scrapped, and I have resided in my own studio apartment for exactly one year. The proposed installment of around 175 DM represents less than 6 % of my monthly income. Employer references confirm stable employment and high reliability.  

I am committed to meeting every obligation punctually and trust this application will receive your favorable judgment.  

With best regards,  
Igor Novak
