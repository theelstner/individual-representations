Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 2 463 DM instalment loan over 24 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my fifteen-year-old vehicle, which can no longer pass inspection. Reliable transportation is essential for my daily commute to the BASF research centre in Limburgerhof, where I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for 5 years and 2 months.

My net monthly income is 3 800 DM. I currently hold two small consumer loans with your bank (total remaining balance 1 150 DM) that I have serviced punctually for the past 18 months. Apart from these, my only liabilities are a life-insurance policy with Allianz (current surrender value 7 200 DM) and a building-society savings plan. I keep 350 DM in a savings account but have not opened a current account until now; my salary is paid to a joint account run by my wife, which is why your records show no checking history under my name.

Our family owns the condominium we have lived in for the last three years, and our housing costs are fully covered. With an instalment rate of 4 % (roughly 110 DM per month), my debt-service ratio will remain below 15 % of my income. My credit file shows one late entry from 2019 that has since been resolved; since then I have maintained an unbroken record of on-time payments.

I trust that my stable employment, property assets and positive payment history with your institution demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the application further.

Sincerely,  
Martin Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a 2 463 DM loan (24 months) to finance a new Volkswagen Polo. Since my wife’s passing last year, I am the sole caregiver for my six-year-old son, and dependable transportation is vital for his daycare drop-off and my commute to the Trier Main Post Office, where I have served as a federal postal clerk for 4 years and 6 months.

My monthly net salary is 3 400 DM. I hold a building-society savings contract with Bausparkasse Mainz currently worth 9 500 DM and maintain 480 DM in a savings account. I have two existing instalment contracts with your bank (household appliances, balance 860 DM) that are up to date. I have no other debts or guarantors.

Because I formerly managed finances through my late wife’s account, I have only now applied for my own current account. I understand this appears unusual, but my documented payment record should confirm my reliability.

The planned repayment (approx. 110 DM monthly) fits comfortably within my budget, and I am prepared to set up automatic deductions from my new account. I believe my stable civil-service position, home ownership and clean repayment history make me a secure candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Johannes Becker

To the Credit Department,

I am requesting a 2 463 DM automobile loan for 24 months to purchase a new Škoda Fabia. As a certified automotive electrician at Siemens Mobility, employed for 6 years and 3 months, I need reliable transport to customer sites around Upper Bavaria.

My take-home pay averages 3 900 DM. Obligations include only two small credits with your bank (combined residual 1 020 DM) and a life-insurance policy (surrender value 6 800 DM). I have saved 420 DM but maintain no separate current account because my employer transfers salary directly onto a prepaid card.

I have lived in my own mortgage-free terraced house for three years with my wife and infant daughter. I have never missed a payment on any obligation; even when my previous account was flagged as “critical” in 2020 due to an administrative error, I resolved the issue within the same month.

The proposed instalment of roughly 110 DM per month is well within my disposable income. I am ready to consolidate my finances by opening a checking account with you, moving both salary inflow and existing credits under one roof.

I trust that my steady employment, assets and punctual payment record illustrate my creditworthiness. I look forward to your favourable reply.

Respectfully,  
Stefan Mayer

Dear Credit Officer,

I seek a 2 463 DM loan over 24 months to buy a new Ford Fiesta. The car is required for my recent transfer to Düsseldorf Airport Customs, forty kilometres from my home. I have worked as a customs officer (Beamter mittlerer Dienst) for 5 years.

My net monthly earnings are 3 650 DM. I possess a building-society savings agreement worth 8 100 DM and keep 370 DM in a savings passbook. My liabilities are limited to two small appliance loans with your branch (current balance 960 DM), both serviced without delay.

Although I have no checking account under my name, my civil-service salary has always been paid to a joint family account. I am ready to open a personal account and mandate direct debit for this loan. My residence, an owner-occupied flat where my wife, daughter and I have lived for three years, is mortgage-free.

The monthly instalment of approximately 110 DM represents less than 10 % of my income, ensuring comfortable repayment. My secure government job, ownership of property and flawless payment history make me a low-risk applicant.

Thank you for examining my request.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Vogel

Esteemed Lending Team,

Please accept my application for a 2 463 DM, 24-month loan to acquire a new Peugeot 208. As a precision mechanic at Lufthansa Technik, employed for 4 years and 1 month, dependable transport is crucial for my shift work at Munich Airport, where public transit options are limited during night hours.

My average net income is 3 500 DM. Existing obligations consist solely of two small instalment contracts with your bank (balance 1 040 DM) that have been serviced punctually since inception. I maintain 400 DM in savings and hold a life-insurance policy with Generali worth 7 500 DM.

My wife, infant son and I have owned and occupied our townhouse for three years. We have no other installment plans or guarantors. I have so far managed expenses via a payroll card provided by my employer; hence no checking history appears under my name. I intend to open a current account with your institution and set up automatic repayment.

With a projected monthly instalment of about 110 DM, my debt-to-income ratio remains below 15 %. My steady employment, property assets and consistent repayment behaviour underscore my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to provide any additional documentation.

Best regards,  
Patrick Weiss
