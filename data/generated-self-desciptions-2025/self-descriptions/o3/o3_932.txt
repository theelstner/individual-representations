Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Jonas Becker, 24. Since 1 March 2025 I have worked as a forklift operator at K&L Logistics GmbH, earning a net 2,050 DM per month. I am requesting a loan of 1,747 DM to buy bedroom and study furniture for my three-year-old son and myself after moving into our first owned flat.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 280 DM and my savings book holds 62 DM, I have always honoured my obligations. The mortgage you granted me last year (balance 5,200 DM) has been serviced punctually for 14 consecutive months. With fixed monthly costs of 1,420 DM I still have sufficient room for the proposed 80 DM instalment over 24 months.

My mother, Gisela Becker (civil servant, salary grade A9), will act as co-applicant and has attached proof of income. I therefore present a stable household, documented repayment discipline and a guarantor with solid means.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time for additional information and look forward to continuing our reliable cooperation.

Sincerely  
Jonas Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Marco Fischer, 24, employed since 15 February 2025 as shift leader at BeanCorner Café, net income 1,860 DM. I seek a 1,747 DM loan to purchase professional espresso equipment that will let me accept a weekend catering contract recently offered by a local event hall.

My account is overdrawn by 190 DM and I hold 55 DM in savings, but my payment record is flawless: last year I repaid your 1,200 DM moving loan three months early. The new side income is expected to add about 400 DM net each month, covering the 80 DM instalment easily.

To strengthen my file, my aunt, Dr. Karin Schulze (physician, monthly net 5,300 DM), agrees to co-sign. I also possess a building-society savings agreement worth 5,600 DM that matures in four years.

I value punctuality in both life and finance and would welcome the opportunity to deepen my relationship with your bank through this small investment in my professional growth.

Kind regards  
Marco Fischer

Honoured Loan Department,

My name is Lucas Gerhardt, 24, single father to my six-year-old daughter. Since December 2024 I have worked as a junior groundskeeper for the city parks department, earning 1,970 DM net. I request 1,747 DM to replace worn-out household appliances and buy a computer my daughter will need for schoolwork.

I maintain a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of 4,900 DM. My prior 900 DM education loan from your bank was cleared on schedule last month. Apart from a 320 DM overdraft, I have no other debts, and my regular expenses leave 500 DM disposable—ample to meet the planned 24-month repayment.

My brother, Daniel Gerhardt (industrial mechanic, net 3,400 DM), is willing to guarantee the loan. Together with my consistent public-sector income and previous repayment record, I believe this demonstrates my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am reachable at my workplace at any time should you need further details.

Respectfully  
Lucas Gerhardt

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Sven Krüger, 24, employed since January 2025 as a night-shift stock clerk at Rhein-Süd Retail AG, monthly net 1,820 DM. To complete basic furnishings in my recently inherited studio and set up a small home workshop for bicycle-repair gigs, I apply for a 1,747 DM loan over 24 months.

My checking account shows a negative balance of 240 DM; savings stand at 70 DM. Nevertheless, I paid off a 1,500 DM relocation credit with you in full and on time earlier this year. Monthly costs total 1,350 DM, leaving more than double the required instalment capacity.

My father, Rolf Krüger (master carpenter, net 4,100 DM), will co-apply and has submitted his income statement. I also hold a building-society contract valued at 6,200 DM that can serve as secondary security.

I have demonstrated prompt repayment in the past and view this loan as the last step toward a stable and productive living situation. I trust you will find my application sound.

Sincerely  
Sven Krüger

To the Loans Committee,

I, Daniel Seidel, 24, request a 1,747 DM loan to equip my new home office with a desk, shelving and a used laser printer so I can accept evening data-entry work in addition to my current job as a hotel porter at Baltic Harbour Hotel (employed since 5 April 2025, net wage 1,750 DM).

Despite a current overdraft of 260 DM and only 48 DM in my savings account, I have a spotless credit history; the 1,000 DM student bridge loan you granted me two years ago was settled early. My fixed monthly expenses stand at 1,310 DM, leaving enough margin for the planned 80 DM repayment.

My cousin, Petra Mayer (tax adviser, net 4,700 DM), is prepared to guarantee the loan. Furthermore, my life-insurance policy—surrender value 4,400 DM—remains untouched as an additional safeguard.

With a proven record of punctual payments, a co-applicant of solid means and supplementary income already arranged, I am confident of meeting every instalment reliably. I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue our positive partnership.

Best regards  
Daniel Seidel
