Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Mehmet Kaya, a 26-year-old Turkish mechanical-engineering technician employed at Bosch GmbH since May 2020. I earn a net salary of 3 100 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 4 788 DM to purchase a 2017 VW Golf that will allow me to commute to late shifts and to drive my two younger brothers, for whom I am legal guardian, to school and medical appointments.  

I have held a current account with your bank for four years. Although the balance is presently –230 DM, this is due to a recent insurance co-payment and will be cleared with my next paycheque on 30 September. I previously took an education loan of 6 000 DM with your branch and have never missed an instalment; only ten months remain. Besides that, I have a building-society savings contract (7 200 DM vested value) and a life-insurance policy naming my brothers as beneficiaries. My monthly budget easily accommodates the proposed instalment of about 120 DM, leaving over 1 900 DM for living costs, support payments and savings.  

I am committed to Germany long-term: I bought a small condominium in Bad-Cannstatt three years ago and have lived there continuously. My steady employment, proven repayment record and collateral in the savings contract make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available during business hours through my supervisor’s office. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Kaya

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Carlos Pereira, request a loan of 4 788 DM to buy a used Ford Focus Kombi. Employed as a scientific research assistant at the Hamburg Customs Laboratory since March 2019, I earn 3 350 DM net monthly. The car will enable me to reach rotating field-sampling sites that are inaccessible by public transport and to transport my twin nieces, whom I support, to afternoon care.  

My current account with your bank shows –150 DM after meeting school-supply expenses. I maintain a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 6 800 DM and hold a Bausparvertrag into which I pay 80 DM monthly. In 2021 I repaid a 3 000 DM relocation loan with your branch six months ahead of time. I have no other debts or credit cards.  

With a planned instalment of roughly 120 DM, my debt-service ratio stays well below 10 %. I have served the German Federal Customs Service for more than six years under a permanent contract, providing stable income and career prospects. My flawless payment history and existing collateral underscore my reliability.  

I would appreciate your favourable decision and am happy to provide any further documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Pereira

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Alexei Borodin, a Russian citizen residing in Germany since childhood. I have worked as an IT support specialist at Infineon Technologies AG since April 2020, currently earning 2 950 DM net each month. I seek financing of 4 788 DM to acquire a 2016 Opel Astra. The vehicle is indispensable for covering the 48-km daily commute between my home in Freital and the Klotzsche campus, as well as transporting my two dependent cousins to weekend language courses.  

I previously opened both checking and savings accounts with your bank in 2019. A balance of –95 DM will be offset upon receipt of my salary next week. In 2022 I obtained a 5 000 DM furniture credit with you and repaid it punctually in 24 instalments. I hold a Bauspar agreement worth 5 400 DM and term life insurance of 50 000 DM. My monthly budget analysis shows that even after a projected 119 DM car-loan payment I will still retain 65 % of net income for household expenses and savings.  

Continuous residence for three years, permanent employment, and a spotless credit record confirm my dependability. I respectfully request approval of this modest loan.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Alexei Borodin

Mannheim, 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officers,  

I am Nguyen Thanh Lam, a 26-year-old Vietnamese logistics clerk at Deutsche Post AG, employed since June 2018. My net monthly income stands at 3 000 DM. I wish to finance 4 788 DM for a used Renault Kangoo to facilitate shift work at the parcel hub and to ferry my two younger siblings, who live with me, to their apprenticeship sites.  

My checking account currently shows –180 DM, caused by an unexpected dental bill; my pay on 28 September will restore a positive balance. I successfully completed repayment of a 4 200 DM apprenticeship loan with your bank last year without delay. I possess a building-society savings plan with a 6 100 DM balance and life insurance of 45 000 DM. I have no additional debts or credit cards.  

The intended monthly instalment of approximately 120 DM represents just 4 % of my take-home pay, leaving ample room for living expenses and savings contributions. Owning my apartment outright, maintaining steady employment for over five years, and demonstrating perfect repayment behaviour make me a low-risk applicant.  

I appreciate your attention and hope for a positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Nguyen Thanh Lam

Esteemed Loan Panel,  

My name is Stefan Kovács, a Hungarian national working as a certified industrial electrician at Schaeffler Technologies since February 2019. I earn 3 200 DM net monthly. I request a loan of 4 788 DM to purchase a well-maintained 2018 Škoda Fabia Combi. Reliable transport is essential for my night-shift schedule and for bringing my two godchildren, who reside with me, to daycare.  

I have maintained my current account with your institution since 2019; the present balance is –75 DM due to a quarterly utilities payment. I repaid a prior 3 500 DM moving loan with you ahead of schedule in 2023. My financial reserves include a Bausparvertrag valued at 5 800 DM and a life-insurance policy that covers 60 000 DM. I hold no other loans, credit cards, or leasing contracts.  

With a projected instalment of 118 DM over 48 months, my total monthly obligations remain comfortably manageable. My stable employment of over six years, home ownership, and impeccable credit history highlight my reliability and commitment.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am eager to continue our strong partnership.  

With best regards,  
Stefan Kovács
