Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Luka Petrović, a 27-year-old certified automotive mechatronics technician employed at MEG-Motors GmbH for the past five years. I am requesting a loan of 3 652 DM over 21 months to purchase diagnostic equipment and a used lift for the small electric-car service garage I am opening in Bad-Cannstatt.  

Financially, my net salary averages 3 100 DM per month. My current checking balance is 120 DM and I hold a building-society savings agreement with a paid-in value of 5 800 DM plus a life-insurance policy for 30 000 DM. I have two small installment contracts with your bank (a washing machine and a laptop) that I have never missed a payment on; the remaining balance on both is below 900 DM.  

Although my credit file shows an old overdraft from another bank, that account was settled eighteen months ago and has remained positive since. I own a modest condominium where I have lived for three years with my six-year-old son Filip.  

The requested loan will be repaid at an installment rate of 2, comfortably covered by my disposable income of roughly 1 400 DM per month after fixed expenses. My steady employment, existing collateral, and flawless payment record with your institution make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available for any additional information and look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Luka Petrović

Mannheim, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Armand Sébastien, a 27-year-old network administrator employed by the Mannheim City Council for six years. I seek a 3 652 DM loan (21 months) to fit out a weekend crêpe food truck I recently licensed. The funds will cover a second griddle, signage and initial stock.  

Income from my civil-service position is 3 250 DM net monthly, supplemented by 400-600 DM from the truck’s current limited operation. My checking balance stands at 70 DM, and my savings account holds 78 DM. While modest, I possess a paid-up life-insurance policy valued at 25 000 DM and an active Bauspar contract worth 6 100 DM, both pledged as collateral.  

I have two ongoing micro-loans with your bank (total remaining 1 150 DM) and have never been late despite supporting my seven-year-old daughter Léonie alone. A critical note from another bank relates to a cellphone contract in 2020 that I cleared the same year.  

With an installment rate of 2, the new payment will not exceed 190 DM monthly, easily absorbed by my salary. My stable public-sector job, proven repayment discipline, and property equity (I own a small studio flat) demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am happy to provide further documents at your convenience.  

Respectfully,  
Armand Sébastien

To the Lending Department,  

I am Hugo Oliveira, 27, a civil-engineering technician with Stadtbau Karlsruhe, where I have worked for four years and eight months. I request a loan of 3 652 DM for 21 months to purchase a used concrete mixer and laser level for freelance weekend projects recently contracted with two local builders.  

My average net salary is 2 950 DM; freelance work already adds roughly 500 DM monthly. My checking account currently shows 80 DM, and my savings passbook 42 DM. I nonetheless hold a Bauspar balance of 5 200 DM and a life-insurance policy of 20 000 DM, both assignable.  

I maintain two installment agreements with your bank (refrigerator and bicycle, balance 640 DM). All payments have been punctual. A “critical” reference from my former Portuguese bank stems from an overdraft closed in 2021 when I moved to Germany.  

I own a small terraced house where I have resided for three years with my eight-year-old son Tiago. The proposed installment rate will be about 180 DM, leaving ample room in my 1 300 DM monthly surplus.  

Given my continuous employment, rising secondary income, and unblemished repayment record since arriving in Germany, I am confident of meeting every obligation.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Hugo Oliveira

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Marek Kowalski, a 27-year-old CNC machinist at Robert Bosch GmbH, where I have been employed for four years and three months. I am seeking a 3 652 DM loan for 21 months to purchase two desktop 3D printers and associated software for a prototype-part service I will run from my home workshop.  

I earn 3 000 DM net per month. My current account stands at 55 DM; my savings are 61 DM. I do, however, maintain a building-society agreement worth 5 400 DM and life insurance of 28 000 DM. I have two small loans with your bank (balance 1 020 DM) that are serviced without delay.  

The only negative mark in my credit history is a car-insurance fee paid late in 2020 while relocating from Poland; everything since has been punctual. I own the apartment where I have lived for three years with my seven-year-old daughter Zofia.  

The new installment of roughly 175 DM corresponds to rate class 2 and fits well within my monthly free cash of over 1 200 DM. My stable employment, owned residence, and impeccable dealings with your bank underline my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and am prepared to supply any further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Marek Kowalski

Esteemed Members of the Loan Board,  

I am Daniel Silva, 27, a laboratory assistant in molecular biology at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden, employed for five and a half years. I request a 3 652 DM loan, repayable over 21 months, to outfit a small home office for a scientific-translation service I have begun offering to publishers.  

My institute salary nets 2 880 DM monthly, with translation income averaging 350 DM so far. My checking account balance is 95 DM; savings are 88 DM. Collateral consists of a Bauspar contract valued at 4 900 DM and a 25 000 DM life-insurance policy.  

I currently service two minor loans with your bank totaling 970 DM; every installment has been honored. A “critical” note in my file concerns a student overdraft from my Brazilian bank, settled two years ago.  

I have owned and occupied a small townhouse for the past three years with my six-year-old son Rafael. The planned installment (≈175 DM) falls comfortably within my disposable budget of 1 250 DM after fixed costs.  

My solid employment, additional income stream, punctual payment record, and available collateral make me a dependable borrower. I hope for your positive decision and remain at your disposal for further questions.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Silva
