Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ana-Maria Bratu, a Romanian national living in Stuttgart since 2022. I am applying for a 409 DM loan to purchase a new television for my rented flat. I have held my checking account with your bank for three years and my monthly salary (averaging 3 100 DM) has been paid into it without interruption.  

I work as a scientific research assistant at Bosch Thermotechnik and have been employed there for 2 ½ years. My net income comfortably covers existing obligations: the two previous personal loans I took from your branch—one for professional training and one for dental work—were both repaid on schedule. I own a small apartment in Sibiu that is rented out, generating an additional 260 DM per month, and I maintain a savings balance of 6 800 DM with your institution.  

The requested sum is modest, the repayment term only twelve months, and the agreed installment of 3 DM will be debited automatically from my account. My consistent repayment record, stable employment, and real-estate asset demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace number +49 711 271-3456 for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Ana-Maria Bratu

To the Lending Department,  

I am Dr. Leonora Jiménez, a 42-year-old Spanish citizen, divorced and living in Munich since 2021. I request a 409 DM loan to buy a DAB radio set that will allow my hearing-impaired daughter and me to keep up with news broadcasts.  

For the past three years I have served as a licensing officer at the European Patent Office, earning a net monthly salary of 4 450 DM. My salary is deposited each month to my checking account with you, which has maintained a minimum balance above 900 DM since opening. I hold 11 200 DM in a fixed-rate bond with your bank and have no other installment plans or guarantors.  

I previously took two twelve-month credits from your branch (home furnishing and language course) and repaid both ahead of schedule. My only dependent is my nine-year-old daughter. We rent a flat, but I own a plot of land in Málaga that is fully paid off.  

Given my stable income, strong savings cushion, and impeccable repayment record, I am confident the requested loan will be serviced without difficulty.  

Thank you for your attention. I can be contacted by email at l.jimenez@epo.eu.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Leonora Jiménez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Emilia Nowak, a Polish citizen residing in Frankfurt for three years. I seek a 409 DM consumer loan to replace my aging television, essential for my evening German-language study program.  

Employment: senior customs officer at Flughafen Frankfurt GmbH since May 2022, gross monthly income 5 000 DM. All wages are credited to my checking account with your bank, opened in July 2021. Current balance never falls below 1 200 DM.  

Assets and liabilities: savings account with 5 500 DM; two prior credits (laptop and bicycle) repaid punctually; no other debts. I own a small farmhouse near Kraków that is leased long-term.  

The requested amount is minor relative to my monthly disposable income, and the 12-month repayment plan at rate 3 DM fits comfortably within my budget. My proven payment discipline and asset base make me a low-risk borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available after 17:00 at my office switchboard.  

Kind regards,  
Emilia Nowak

Loan Department,  

My name is Sofia Dimitrova, Bulgarian, age 42, married, living in Cologne since 2020. I apply for a 409 DM loan to purchase a combined radio-TV set for our rented apartment.  

I have worked as a certified laboratory technician at Bayer AG for 1 year and 8 months, earning 3 600 DM net per month. Salaries are transferred to my checking account here, which maintains an average closing balance of 700 DM. My savings with your bank stand at 3 100 DM.  

My two previous credits (childcare costs and relocation expenses) were both cleared exactly on schedule. We have no other loans, and our only dependent is our 11-year-old son. Additionally, my husband and I co-own a mortgage-free flat in Varna that is rented to tourists.  

The loan will be repaid comfortably within twelve months via automatic deduction, ensuring timely installments. My stable income, real-estate collateral, and impeccable credit record illustrate my reliability.  

I appreciate your favorable evaluation and remain at your disposal for questions.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Dimitrova
