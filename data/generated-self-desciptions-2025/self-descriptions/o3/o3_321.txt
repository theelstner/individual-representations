Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ana Kovač, a 27-year-old Croatian national who has lived and worked in Stuttgart for the past four years. I am applying for a loan of 3 643 DM to purchase bedroom and study furniture for the flat that I bought last autumn. At present I share a single wardrobe with my six-year-old son; the new furnishings will allow us each a proper space and enable me to install a small work corner for my evening vocational classes.

I have been employed for eight years as a packaging line operator at Fichtl Lebensmittel GmbH and earn a net salary of 2 250 DM per month. Although my current cheque account shows a debit balance of 312 DM and I have only 87 DM on my savings book, my fixed expenses are modest and stable. The two existing loans with your bank (washing machine, 2021; boiler replacement, 2022) are being served punctually—20 instalments have been paid without delay since I arranged a standing order last January. A 23 000 DM life-insurance policy with Württembergische provides additional security.

I request an instalment rate of 245 DM over 15 months, which fits comfortably within my monthly budget plan. After my brief payment difficulties two years ago I enrolled in a household-finance course run by the local Volkshochschule, and my account history since then shows consistent discipline.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to supply any further documents you may need.

Kind regards,  
Ana Kovač

To the Credit Committee,

I am Isabel dos Santos Möller, married, age 27, and have lived in my own condominium in Dortmund-Scharnhorst for four years. I seek a loan of 3 643 DM to equip a small home workshop (workbench, professional sewing machine, storage shelves) that will let me extend my evening alterations business.

For the past seven and a half years I have worked as an unskilled shift employee at Zeche Nord GmbH, presently earning 2 380 DM net. My checking account is overdrawn by 274 DM, and my building-society contract with LBS has a value of 1 100 DM, of which 56 DM is freely available. Despite a late-payment episode in 2021, I have never missed an instalment since signing a direct-debit authorisation. I am currently servicing two small consumer loans with your bank (remaining balance 1 740 DM); both are on schedule.

The requested credit would be repaid over 15 months at 250 DM monthly. My husband supports household costs, so repayment rests on my own income alone and does not endanger the family budget for our three-year-old daughter. Our life-insurance policy (insured sum 30 000 DM) is pledged as collateral.

I value the long relationship I have had with your branch and look forward to continuing it. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Isabel dos Santos Möller

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Petra Hassan, separated, mother of a seven-year-old boy, and a resident of Mannheim since 2021. I respectfully request a loan of 3 643 DM to buy essential furniture—sofa, wardrobe, and child’s desk—after moving from company accommodation to my own flat.

Employment: warehouse assistant at Rhein-Kurier Logistik GmbH for the past eight years, current net income 2 120 DM. In addition, I earn roughly 220 DM monthly from weekend catering shifts. Although my current account stands at –359 DM and I hold only 43 DM in a savings book, my monthly expense plan leaves 260 DM free, which I propose as the instalment amount over 15 months.

Credit record: I acknowledge delays on two instalments during the pandemic in 2022. Since then, all 18 subsequent payments on my existing loans with your bank have been made on or before the due date via automatic debit. I maintain a 25 000 DM life-insurance policy with Generali that can be assigned as security.

With a stable job, additional side income, and demonstrated improvement in payment behaviour, I believe I am a reliable candidate. I am willing to provide employer confirmation and insurance pledge immediately.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,  
Petra Hassan

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I, Elena Schneiderová, divorced, 27, apply for a 3 643 DM consumer loan to outfit my flat with ergonomic office equipment (adjustable desk, chair, filing cabinet) required for the data-entry work I now perform from home three evenings a week.

Primary employment: assembly helper at Franken-Plastik KG since February 2017, net pay 2 030 DM. Side job: remote data entry for B-Pro Systems, average 300 DM. Current cheque account: –298 DM. Savings book: 62 DM. Property: ongoing Bausparvertrag, current value 7 800 DM.

Past credit difficulties were limited to a two-month deferral in 2021 after my divorce; all 22 subsequent instalments on my two existing loans have been discharged flawlessly. I propose monthly payments of 250 DM for 15 months, which leaves more than 15 % of my income for contingencies. My 20 000 DM Signal Iduna life-insurance policy is available as collateral.

My residence of four years and my improving credit conduct show my commitment to financial stability. The requested equipment will increase my supplementary income and thus my repayment capacity.

Thank you very much for reviewing my request. I am happy to meet personally at your convenience.

Respectfully,  
Elena Schneiderová

Hamburg, 02 May 2025  

Dear Ms. Krüger,

I am Noor Al-Rashid, married, aged 27, living in my own cooperative flat in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg since 2021. I hereby apply for a loan of 3 643 DM to purchase children’s bedroom furniture and a washing machine before the birth of my second child in September.

Employment: for eight years I have worked as a production-line aide at Elbe-Fischkonserven GmbH, earning 2 270 DM net. My spouse’s income covers household running costs; the loan instalment would be met solely from my salary. Despite a current account overdraft of 334 DM and only 79 DM in savings, my pay-slip and budget plan show that 255 DM per month can be dedicated to repayments over 15 months.

I acknowledge two late payments on an earlier micro-loan in 2020, both settled with accrued interest. Since then, all obligations—including the two active credits at your bank—have been honoured punctually via automatic transfer. I maintain a 28 000 DM life-insurance policy with Allianz, which I am willing to assign as security.

With stable long-term employment, a supportive household, and an established record of improved payment discipline, I am confident of meeting the proposed schedule. I look forward to your favourable reply and stand ready to provide any further documentation.

Yours faithfully,  
Noor Al-Rashid
