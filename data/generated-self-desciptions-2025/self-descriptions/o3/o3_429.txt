Letter 1  
Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a 46-year-old Serbian engineer employed as a signal-maintenance technician with Deutsche Bahn in Stuttgart since March 2021. I am applying for a loan of 1,149 DM to purchase a new 32-inch television and DAB+ radio set for my eight-year-old son and myself. We currently rely on a worn-out unit that fails frequently.

My net income is 4,200 DM per month. I own a two-room condominium in Bad Cannstatt, fully paid off, and keep 3,250 DM in a savings bond. Although my current account was briefly overdrawn last year, it has been balanced since. I hold two small car-repair loans with your bank that I have serviced for 18 months without a single late installment; both will be cleared in eight months.

The requested loan would be repaid over 18 months at the standard rate of 4 %, which comfortably fits my budget. I have no guarantors, no other installment obligations, and can provide proof of employment and property ownership.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my stable income, existing collateral, and positive repayment record make me a reliable borrower.

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Luka Ivanov, a 46-year-old Bulgarian national, have worked as a senior customs officer at Frankfurt Airport since August 2020. I wish to obtain a credit of 1,149 DM to buy a quality radio-television combination for my apartment. The equipment will enable me to follow German news broadcasts and improve my language skills.

My monthly net salary is 4,500 DM, and I possess 4,600 DM in federal savings bonds. I own a small terraced house in Offenbach where I have lived for three years. I currently hold two bicycle-repair micro-loans with your bank; every installment has been paid on or before its due date for the past 18 months.

Although a previous credit card at another institution was once marked “critical,” the balance has since been settled in full. With no dependents other than my teenage niece, no guarantors, and no new installment plans, I am well able to meet an 18-month repayment schedule.

I look forward to your favorable response and am available for any further documentation you may need.

Kind regards,  
Luka Ivanov



Letter 3  
To the Lending Department,

My name is Mateo Rossi. I am an Italian structural-CAD draftsman employed by Engel & Partner Architekten in Munich since December 2021, earning a net 3,800 DM monthly. I seek a loan of 1,149 DM to purchase a smart TV-radio unit that supports the design tutorials my eleven-year-old daughter watches for her school projects.

Financially, I maintain 2,700 DM in a Sparkasse savings account and own a one-bedroom apartment in Schwabing, bought with family funds. I have two existing tools-financing loans at your bank; both are 18 months old and have never been in arrears. My only other debt is a 300 DM line of credit at another bank, which is current.

I can comfortably repay the requested amount within the proposed term and rate, as my housing is mortgage-free and I have no additional installment obligations.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am committed to continuing my spotless repayment record with your institution.

Respectfully,  
Mateo Rossi



Letter 4  
Dear Credit Committee,

I am Marek Novák, a Czech mechanical-maintenance supervisor at Leitz GmbH in Ulm, employed since January 2020. I respectfully request a loan of 1,149 DM to replace my outdated television and radio, essential for following technical broadcasts and keeping my nine-year-old son engaged with educational programs.

I earn 4,100 DM net per month. I own a small detached house in Ulm-Jungingen and have 3,800 DM invested in a Bundespost savings bond. Two small appliance loans with your bank, opened 18 months ago, stand in excellent status. A prior shortfall on my former bank account is fully resolved, and I have maintained positive balances since.

With no other installment plans, no guarantors, and only one dependent, I can service the new loan easily at the proposed installment rate. I am prepared to provide payslips, property documents, and savings statements upon request.

I appreciate your evaluation of my application and hope to strengthen my long-standing relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Marek Novák

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Emre Kaya, a 46-year-old Turkish citizen living in Cologne for the past three years. Since May 2021 I have been employed as a senior administrative clerk at the municipal housing office, earning a net monthly income of 3,900 DM. I intend to borrow 1,149 DM to purchase a combined radio and television set so I can follow council sessions broadcast after work and help my son with German language programs.

I own a small condominium in Köln-Ehrenfeld, valued at 170,000 DM, and maintain 3,150 DM in a savings account. Two minor renovation loans with your institution have been serviced on schedule for 18 consecutive months. While I previously had a critical balance on an external credit line, it has been settled, and no new obligations exist.

With secure employment, property collateral, and a proven repayment history, I am confident of meeting the 18-month repayment plan without strain.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive reply.

Best regards,  
Emre Kaya
