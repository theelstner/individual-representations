Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Luis Márquez, a 28-year-old avionics technician employed at Lufthansa Technik GmbH since July 2015. During the past eight years I have held a permanent contract, earning a net salary of 3,200 DM per month and supporting my six-year-old son who lives with me.  

I am applying for a loan of 3,595 DM over 36 months to purchase a high-definition television set and digital radio receiver. These devices will allow my son and me to follow German language programmes and remain in touch with news from our native Guatemala via international stations.  

Although I do not keep a checking account, I have maintained one consumer credit with your bank (contract no. 14-928-03) and have never missed or delayed an installment. All other obligations have likewise been honoured in full and on time. Apart from a modest savings balance of 82 DM, I own my condominium in Hamburg-Barmbek and a 2019 Opel Corsa valued at roughly 7,000 DM, both fully paid.  

With stable long-term employment, a clean repayment record, and no other debts or guarantors, I am confident I can meet the proposed class-4 installment plan of about 115 DM per month. I look forward to continuing our positive relationship.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Luis Márquez

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Petr Novák, single, 28, a Czech national working as a customs officer at the Baden-Württemberg State Customs Office since March 2017. My gross income is 4,100 DM, and I have been in the civil-service pay scale A7 for the past six years.  

I wish to finance the purchase of a combined smart-TV and DAB+ radio system costing 3,595 DM, to be repaid over 36 months. Owning my apartment in Stuttgart-Ost but lacking a current account, I rely on my monthly salary transfer to a wage card and have kept less than 100 DM in a small savings passbook.  

Three years ago your bank granted me a 2,000 DM furniture loan, which I repaid in full last month without a single late payment. I hold no other loans, credit cards, or overdrafts. My only dependent is my younger brother, whom I support with a modest remittance while he finishes vocational school.  

Given my uninterrupted public-sector employment, property ownership, and flawless repayment history, I am confident I can service the new obligation at the standard rate-class 4 of roughly 115 DM per month.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Petr Novák

Munich, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ahmed Ali, 28, working as a senior laboratory technician at Bayerische Polymerwerke AG since May 2016. My net monthly income stands at 3,000 DM. I reside in my own studio in Munich-Moosach where I live with my four-year-old daughter, Leila.  

I seek a 3,595 DM loan payable over 36 months to acquire a quality television and Internet-enabled radio. Aside from enhancing our German language skills, these devices will permit video calls with my parents in Alexandria and educational streaming for my child.  

My previous 1,500 DM appliance loan from your branch (account 55-441-09) was settled ahead of schedule last quarter. I have no other credits, no overdraft facility, and savings of only 63 DM. I do, however, own a fully paid 2018 Volkswagen Polo and the apartment noted above.  

With nearly nine years of continuous employment, a spotless credit record, and stable living arrangements, I am certain I can meet the class-4 installment of 115 DM each month.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Best regards,  
Ahmed Ali

Cologne, 17 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Daniel Rossi, an Italian citizen and administrative clerk at the Cologne Municipal Building Authority since January 2015. I earn a consistent net salary of 2,900 DM, hold tenure status, and have been living at my present address for two years.  

I apply for a 3,595 DM loan to purchase a 55-inch OLED television and digital radio tuner. The equipment will allow me to complete an online German-for-C1 course that relies on broadcast content and to follow municipal council sessions transmitted only on local DVB-T2 channels.  

Your bank financed my car in 2021 with a 6,000 DM loan, which I finished repaying as scheduled last month. I possess no other debts, maintain fewer than 100 DM in savings, and have no checking account because my salary is delivered via municipal pay card. My six-year-old nephew, whom I support, is my sole dependent.  

Owning my condominium and having met every past obligation punctually, I am confident of covering the 36 installments of approximately 115 DM.  

Thank you in advance for your positive evaluation.  

Faithfully yours,  
Daniel Rossi  



Letter 5  
Frankfurt am Main, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Ivan Petrov, 28 years old, employed as a tool-and-die maker at Siemens Energy Turbine Works since April 2014. My monthly net pay is 3,150 DM. I live in a self-owned apartment in Frankfurt-Nied along with my five-year-old son.  

I request a 3,595 DM credit over 36 months to buy a 4K television and satellite radio receiver. The purchase will allow my family to access both German educational channels and Russian-language programmes that help my child remain bilingual.  

I previously held a 2,800 DM renovation loan with your institution (contract 73-610-12) and completed repayment two months early. I have no checking account, fewer than 100 DM in a basic savings passbook, and no other liabilities. My assets include a 2020 Skoda Fabia and my mortgage-free apartment.  

Given my eleven-year uninterrupted employment, solid repayment history, and stable living conditions, I am certain I can meet the class-4 payment schedule of roughly 115 DM monthly.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov
