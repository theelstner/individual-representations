Munich, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Martin Novak, a 28-year-old Czech national who has lived and worked in Munich for the past eight years. Since 2017 I have been a certified mechanical technician at the BMW Group engine plant, earning a steady net income of about 3,200 DM per month.  

I would like to request a loan of 1,068 DM for the purchase of a 55-inch OLED television and digital radio system. The loan term of six months fits comfortably into my budget; even with a monthly instalment of roughly 180 DM I will retain more than 50 % of my disposable income.  

My financial record is solid. I still maintain my first current account with your bank, which is usually kept around 150 DM. A previous 1,500 DM appliance loan was repaid three months ahead of schedule last year. I have no other debts, my savings account holds a modest 80 DM, and I own a 2014 Volkswagen Golf outright.  

Because of my long, uninterrupted employment, reliable repayment history, and stable living situation (I own my flat and have resided there for four years), I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Novak

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Alejandro Ruiz, a 28-year-old Spanish software-support officer employed by Siemens AG in Berlin since March 2018. I respectfully apply for a 1,068 DM loan to purchase a new smart TV and DAB radio for my recently renovated studio apartment.  

My net salary is 2,950 DM per month, and my mandatory expenses total less than 1,600 DM. A monthly instalment of around 180 DM over six months will not strain my finances. My current account with your institution usually stays near 120 DM, and my savings booklet shows 70 DM.  

I have one previous credit with your bank—a 2,000 DM relocation loan from 2021—that I repaid on time and without incident. I own a 2016 Opel Astra and have no outstanding obligations elsewhere. Having lived at the same Kreuzberg address for four years, I value stability and prudent money management.  

I am confident my income history and spotless repayment record demonstrate that I am a low-risk borrower. Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Kind regards,  
Alejandro Ruiz

Hamburg, 8 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Jürgen Kim, a 28-year-old South Korean mechanical drafter employed by the Hamburg Port Authority for the last nine years. I am seeking a loan of 1,068 DM to finance the purchase of a high-definition television and digital radio set for my home office, where I often work remotely.  

My gross monthly pay is 4,100 DM, yielding approximately 3,050 DM net. With fixed costs of about 1,500 DM, I can comfortably service a six-month plan at roughly 180 DM per month. My current account balance averages 180 DM and my savings total 95 DM.  

In 2022 I took a 1,200 DM education loan with your bank, repaid in full and on schedule. I have no guarantors, no additional loans, and my 2015 Mazda 3 is fully owned. Having lived in my condominium for four years, I am rooted in the community and intend to remain here long-term.  

Given my consistent employment, clean credit record, and low debt load, I trust you will find my application favourable. I appreciate your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Jürgen Kim

Stuttgart, 9 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Marko Petrovic, a 28-year-old Serbian electrical-maintenance official at the Stuttgart Municipal Tram Service, where I have worked for eight years. I request a six-month loan of 1,068 DM to buy a new 4K television and digital tuner as part of upgrading my home entertainment system.  

I earn 3,000 DM net monthly and keep my essential expenses to about 1,400 DM. Servicing a 180 DM monthly repayment therefore presents no difficulty. My current account balance typically stands at 140 DM, and I keep 60 DM in a small savings bond.  

I previously borrowed 900 DM from your bank to purchase household appliances; the loan was cleared last December without a single late payment. I own a 2013 Ford Focus and have no other liabilities. My residence, which I purchased four years ago, further underlines my stability.  

I believe my reliable employment, spotless repayment history, and prudent budgeting establish me as a dependable borrower. Thank you for your time and the opportunity to continue our positive banking relationship.  

Yours faithfully,  
Marko Petrovic

Frankfurt am Main, 11 September 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Ivan Dimitrov, 28, a Bulgarian national and senior laboratory technician at Merck KGaA, where I have been employed since July 2016. I am applying for a 1,068 DM loan over six months to purchase a combined UHD television and digital radio unit for my newly renovated living room.  

My net income averages 3,350 DM per month. After fixed costs of roughly 1,600 DM, I have ample room to cover a 180 DM monthly instalment. My checking account with your bank fluctuates around 160 DM, and I hold 90 DM in a savings account.  

The only prior credit I have ever taken—a 1,500 DM furniture loan from 2020—was repaid six weeks early. I own a 2016 Audi A3 outright, possess no other debts, and have resided in my condominium for four years. These factors, combined with my uninterrupted nine-year employment record, demonstrate my financial responsibility.  

I respectfully request your favorable decision and look forward to many more years of cooperation with your institution.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Dimitrov
