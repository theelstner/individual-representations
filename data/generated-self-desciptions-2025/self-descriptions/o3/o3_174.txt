Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Schulz, 34, divorced, and the owner of a newly opened coffee-bar on Berliner Allee. To finish the guest area I still need tables, chairs and a refrigerated counter. The missing amount comes to 2 064 DM, which I am requesting for 24 months.  

Financially, my checking account holds about 150 DM and my savings account 80 DM, but I own a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of 14 300 DM that I have pledged as collateral. I have one existing small loan with your bank; the remaining balance is 520 DM and will be cleared in six months. A temporary illness two years ago led to late payments, yet since then every obligation has been met on schedule.  

The café already turns an average net profit of 3 500 DM per month, easily covering the planned 3 % installment rate. I have resided in my own apartment for two years, my telephone number is unchanged, and I am available at all times. This modest loan will let me complete the premises and increase revenue.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good cooperation.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Schulz

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dr. Katharina E. Weiss, 34, separated, currently between positions after my former employer, Biocare GmbH, closed its R&D division. I have a signed contract to start as Product Manager at Pharmamed AG on 1 December with a gross salary of 7 200 DM.  

I request a 2 064 DM loan over 24 months to furnish a home office and buy a computer, which the new job requires. My current account shows 90 DM and my building-society savings stand at 70 DM; however, the savings agreement matures next May at 18 000 DM.  

Two years ago a late maternity allowance caused me to miss one installment on a previous loan, but I caught up the very next month and have had no issues since. I own my flat, have lived there for two years, and my life-insurance policy is paid to date. With only one six-month-old credit at your bank (balance 800 DM) and no other debts, the proposed monthly payment of about 87 DM is fully covered.  

I hope you will view my strong earning outlook and collateral as proof of reliability. Thank you for your time.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Katharina E. Weiss

Dear Lending Department,  

I am Monika Keller, a self-employed graphic designer, 34, divorced with a six-year-old daughter. I seek a loan of 2 064 DM for 24 months to purchase a high-resolution printer and ergonomic furniture for my studio.  

Average monthly turnover is 6 000 DM, yielding 3 200 DM net, which comfortably supports the roughly 90 DM installment. My current account balance is 60 DM and savings 20 DM, but I hold a life-insurance policy worth 11 600 DM that can be assigned to the bank.  

In 2022 a major client’s insolvency delayed two installments on my existing personal loan; since then every payment has been punctually debited, and only 640 DM remain outstanding. I live in my own condominium (two years residence) and have no other credit obligations.  

You may reach me anytime on the registered telephone number 0711-88 44 37. I am confident the requested equipment will boost income by at least 15 %, further strengthening my repayment ability.  

Thank you for considering my application and for your continued trust.  

Kind regards,  
Monika Keller

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Sandra Hartmann, 34, married, formerly senior officer at the City Building Authority. Following a municipal merger my position was eliminated; I am completing a real-estate certification and will re-enter employment in January at an agreed salary of 5 800 DM.  

I request 2 064 DM payable over 24 months to install a new kitchen and replace outdated appliances. The checking account linked to you holds 180 DM; savings are 90 DM in a building-society contract due to reach 25 000 DM in 2028.  

I acknowledge one delayed payment three years ago after my husband’s surgery. All installments since have been on time, and our remaining loan with your bank (car finance) stands at 1 200 DM. Owning our house and having no other debts place us in a stable position; the projected installment of approximately 86 DM fits well within our current temporary unemployment benefits plus my forthcoming salary.  

I can be contacted at 0231-55 19 08 for any clarification. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Sandra Hartmann

To the Loan Department,  

I am Beate König, 34, separated and mother of one. After eight successful years as a management consultant I chose to start freelance work this summer. To set up my home office and furnish my son’s room I request a 2 064 DM loan for 24 months.  

Current liquid funds are scarce (checking 120 DM, savings 95 DM) because I invested in marketing and insurance contributions. Nevertheless, confirmed contracts amount to 9 000 DM over the next quarter, and typical monthly net income is projected at 4 000 DM—more than enough to cover the 3 % installment.  

A late payment four years ago, caused by an employer’s payroll error, is the only blemish on my credit file; every commitment afterward has been honored. I own my apartment, have lived here two years, hold a life-insurance policy valued at 13 800 DM, and maintain one small active credit with your bank (balance 450 DM).  

My telephone is registered and always reachable at 040-67 22 11. I am confident my professional background and transparent finances demonstrate reliability.  

Thank you very much for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Beate König
