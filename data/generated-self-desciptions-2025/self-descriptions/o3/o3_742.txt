Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dragan Petrovic, a 32-year-old Serbian mechanical technician employed by Siemens Turbo Machinery GmbH for the past five years. I am applying for a DM 2 325 loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my thirteen-year-old car, which can no longer pass TÜV inspection. Reliable transport is essential because my shift begins at 5 a.m., when public transit is unavailable, and because I need to take my six-year-old son to school on my way to work.  

Although my checking account is currently DM 146 overdrawn, I have DM 350 in a savings account and own a small condominium in Bad Cannstatt where I have lived for three years. My net income averages DM 3 100 per month, and I have no other debts or guarantors. Four years ago I financed home renovations through your bank and repaid that credit ahead of schedule.  

The requested amount can be comfortably repaid in 24 monthly installments of approximately DM 100, leaving ample room in my budget. My stable employment, prior repayment record, and modest savings demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our successful banking relationship.  

Sincerely  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, José Alvarez, 32 years old and a Spanish electrical engineer at BASF SE, kindly request a loan of DM 2 325 for the purchase of a new Volkswagen Polo. After four and a half years with BASF, my monthly net salary stands at DM 3 400, and I expect a promotion next quarter. A dependable vehicle is crucial for my 30-kilometre daily commute and for taking my four-year-old daughter to kindergarten.  

My current account shows an overdraft of DM 92, caused by recent relocation costs, but I maintain DM 420 in government bonds and own the two-room flat I occupy. I have lived there for three years. Your bank financed that property, and I repaid the loan exactly on schedule. I have no other installments and no guarantors.  

With a planned 24-month repayment at about DM 100 per month, the loan will represent less than four percent of my net income, ensuring safe and timely repayment. I have always honoured my financial obligations and intend to continue doing so.  

Thank you for reviewing my application and for your continued support.  

Kind regards  
José Alvarez

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ivan Dimitrov, a Bulgarian foreign worker employed as an IT support technician for Deutsche Bahn AG for six years. I respectfully apply for a DM 2 325 loan to purchase a new Skoda Fabia. My old vehicle failed emissions testing, and shift work in the rail operations centre makes public transport impractical.  

I earn a steady net salary of DM 3 050. My checking account is DM 120 in debit after paying medical expenses for my mother, who is my sole dependent. Nevertheless, I hold DM 260 in a savings plan and own a 2017 Hyundai i10, which I will trade in, as well as a small townhouse where I have lived for three years.  

Two years ago I took a DM 5 000 personal loan from your branch and repaid it three months early. I request a 24-month term with installments near DM 100, which fits comfortably into my monthly budget.  

My continuous employment, property ownership, and spotless repayment history attest to my reliability. I appreciate your consideration.  

Respectfully  
Ivan Dimitrov

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Ahmed Saleh, 32, an Egyptian research laboratory assistant at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, employed since January 2021. I seek a DM 2 325 loan to buy a new Dacia Sandero. My duties require travel between Adlershof and Charité campuses, and my current car’s repairs exceed its value.  

My net monthly income is DM 2 980. The checking account linked to my salary stands DM 75 overdrawn after covering tuition fees for my five-year-old son. I have DM 150 in a growth savings account and own a cooperative apartment where I have resided for three years.  

In 2022, your bank granted me a DM 800 equipment loan, which I repaid in full two months early. I propose to amortise the present loan over 24 months at about DM 100 per instalment, well within my disposable income.  

My steady employment contract, existing collateral in the form of my vehicle and apartment share, and proven repayment record confirm that I am a low-risk applicant. I look forward to a positive response.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Saleh

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

I, Piotr Nowak, a 32-year-old Polish customs officer employed by the Federal Customs Service for six years and three months, hereby apply for a DM 2 325 loan. I intend to purchase a new Toyota Yaris to replace my twelve-year-old car that has become increasingly unreliable for field inspections at the port of Hamburg.  

My net earnings are DM 3 250 monthly. The associated checking account is currently DM 101 overdrawn due to recent dental surgery, but I retain DM 480 in a savings certificate and own the detached house I inherited from my parents, where I have lived for three years. I have one dependant, my younger brother, whom I support through university.  

Four years ago I obtained a DM 4 000 renovation loan from your institution and repaid it precisely on time. I seek a 24-month repayment schedule with installments of roughly DM 100, which represent only a small fraction of my income.  

Given my civil-service status, previous flawless repayment history, and existing property, I believe I meet all criteria for this modest loan. Thank you for your favorable consideration.  

Yours faithfully  
Piotr Nowak
