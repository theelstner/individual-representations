Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Popescu, a 23-year-old divorced mother of a two-year-old boy. I moved from Romania two years ago and I now own a 28 m² studio on Ludwigstrasse, purchased with a small mortgage you granted me in 2023. All installments on that loan have been transferred on schedule.

I have been working for the past eight months as a breakfast-kitchen assistant at Hotel Königshof, earning a net 2,050 DM per month. My current checking-account balance is 150 DM and I maintain a building-society savings agreement with 300 DM already paid in. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no telephone contract that could add hidden liabilities.

I am applying for an 836 DM loan with a 12-month term and a monthly installment of approximately 70 DM. The funds will cover the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to work split shifts and pick up my son from daycare without relying on unpredictable public transport. The added mobility should also let me work extra events the hotel offers, increasing my income.

My payment history with your bank is spotless, and I intend to keep it that way. Life-insurance coverage matching the loan value is already in place and can be pledged as collateral.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Maria Popescu

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ana-Lucía Santos, a 23-year-old separated resident of Stuttgart. For the last nine months I have worked as a warehouse picker for Schwaben-Logistik GmbH with a stable net salary of 1,920 DM. I currently have 120 DM in my checking account and 250 DM in a savings bond started last year.

Your bank issued me a 500 DM education loan in 2022, which I repaid three months early. I am now requesting an 836 DM twelve-month loan to finance a new Dacia Spring Electric. Owning the car will lower my commuting time from 90 minutes to 20, allowing me to accept the night-shift position recently offered (shift premium: +300 DM/month).

I live with my four-year-old daughter in a condominium I bought from my parents; the land-registry deed is in my name free of encumbrances. A small life-insurance policy (10,000 DM) stands ready for assignment to the bank as additional security.

My record of punctual repayments, steady employment, and modest but growing savings demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for your support once again.

Sincerely,  
Ana-Lucía Santos

To the Credit Department,

My name is Yeliz Kaya, 23, married, Turkish citizen working in Germany. I have been employed for seven months as a cleaning operative at Airbus Operations, earning 1,800 DM after tax. My checking balance stands at 80 DM; my savings account holds 400 DM. I own a small terraced house on Kellerstrasse that my husband and I bought two years ago; our separate mortgage is up to date.

I request an 836 DM loan over twelve months (roughly 72 DM per month) to complete the purchase of a new VW up! for my personal use. The vehicle will enable me to take overtime shifts that start at 4 a.m., impossible with public buses. Extra income will raise household cash flow by about 250 DM monthly, ensuring easy repayment.

I previously held a 300 DM overdraft with your branch; it was cleared in full and on time. No other liabilities exist. A building-society contract valued at 6,500 DM can be pledged as secondary security.

I appreciate your consideration and am confident I will meet every installment promptly.

Respectfully,  
Yeliz Kaya

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Sofie Schneider, a 23-year-old divorced single mother of one. Since August 2024 I have worked as a cafeteria attendant at Siemens AG, earning 1,950 DM net each month. My checking account holds 160 DM and I deposit 50 DM monthly into a life-insurance savings plan, current balance 320 DM.

I kindly request an 836 DM loan, payable in 12 equal installments, to finance a new Renault Twingo. My previous 2010 model broke down beyond repair; reliable transport is essential for the 25-km commute to the Siemens campus.

Your institution granted me a start-up loan of 600 DM two years ago, which I repaid without a single delay. I have zero other debts, no guarantors, and have lived in my own apartment in Südstadt for two years.

Given my spotless repayment record, stable employment, and existing life-insurance collateral, I believe I am a low-risk candidate. I look forward to a favorable reply.

With thanks,  
Sofie Schneider

Frankfurt-Oder, 08 May 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Elena Petrova, 23, married, with a six-month-old daughter. For the past ten months I have worked as an unskilled production helper at OderChem GmbH, earning a consistent 1,880 DM net per month. My current account shows 95 DM; my building-society savings balance is 270 DM. I hold no telephone contract and carry no other consumer debts.

Two years ago your branch extended a 700 DM relocation loan, fully repaid last December. I now seek an 836 DM, 12-month loan to cover the remaining cost of a new Skoda Fabia Combi. The car will enable my husband and me to share commuting duties and reduce costly taxi rides to the pediatric clinic.

I own the apartment we live in, purchased with family funds; a clear land-registry extract is available. In addition, a life-insurance policy for 15,000 DM is assignable as security.

My earnings comfortably exceed the projected 72 DM monthly installment, and my payment history proves my reliability. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
Elena Petrova
