Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 4 716 € to purchase a new Opel Corsa, which I need for commuting to my night shifts at Ruhr-Logistik GmbH. I have worked there as a forklift operator since July 2024 and earn 2 250 € net per month plus weekend bonuses.

My checking account is currently 340 € overdrawn after school fees for my two children in Porto. Besides that overdraft and the two existing credits I have with you (mortgage and furniture loan), I have no other obligations here in Germany. Both credits have been serviced punctually for three years.

I own the apartment in which I live, valued at roughly 115 000 €. Only 28 000 € remain on the mortgage, and I am prepared to list the property as collateral. My probation period ends next month, and my employer has confirmed permanent employment.

Stable income, real-estate collateral and a flawless instalment record demonstrate my reliability. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss terms.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely  
Manuel da Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,

I request a credit of 4 716 € to buy a new Dacia Sandero Stepway. Public transport no longer serves the greenhouse where I work after 17 h, so a car is essential if I am to keep the overtime that makes up a third of my income.

I have been an unskilled horticulture assistant at Fränkische Gemüse GmbH for ten months, earning 2 000 € net monthly plus seasonal bonuses. My current negative balance of 250 € will be cleared on payday, 25 May.

The mortgage on my terraced house in Höchstadt and a 6 000 € renovation loan—both with your bank—have been paid on time for 36 months. The house is now worth about 83 000 €, leaving ample equity.

As the sole provider for my two children in Sofia, dependable transport secures my livelihood. My consistent payment record, property collateral and imminent permanent contract make me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your reply.

Kind regards  
Viktor Ivanov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a loan of 4 716 € to buy a new Toyota Aygo that will let me travel between construction sites for M & M Gerüstbau GmbH. I have worked there nine months and earn 2 180 € net monthly.

Although my account shows an overdraft of 420 €, all debits—including the mortgage and appliance loan I hold with you—have always been covered punctually. I own a two-room condominium valued at about 105 000 €, with only 24 000 € outstanding on the mortgage.

My two dependent sons live in Aleppo; having a car will allow me to accept extra evening shifts and raise my income by roughly 300 € per month. My solid repayment history, real-estate equity and growing earnings make me a safe candidate.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely  
Ahmed Al-Karim

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a 4 716 € loan to purchase a new Škoda Fabia. Reliable transport is indispensable for my job as a kitchen porter with Munich Catering Services GmbH, where shifts often end after public transport stops. I have been employed eight months and earn 2 050 € net monthly plus tips.

I currently have two loans with you—a mortgage on my studio apartment and a 2 500 € renovation loan—both serviced without delay since 2021. The 310 € overdraft on my checking account resulted from school costs for my two daughters in Galway and will be cleared with my next salary.

The apartment, bought for 120 000 €, is now valued at 142 000 €, leaving ample equity as collateral. My stable income and flawless repayment history underline my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further information.

Kind regards

Dear Sir or Madam,

I hereby apply for a loan of 4 716 € to finance a new Renault Clio. The car will let me reach multiple painting sites for Farbenkraft GmbH, where I have worked as a building painter’s assistant since August 2024. My net income is 2 270 € per month with regular overtime.

My giro account is 280 € overdrawn after unexpected dental costs for my two children in Seville; this will be balanced on 26 May. Aside from that and the two credits I hold with you (mortgage and home-equipment loan), I have no other borrowing.

I own the townhouse at Südplatz 7, valued at roughly 110 000 €, with only 27 500 € remaining on the mortgage. Over 30 months every instalment has been booked on time and in full.

Stable employment, provable equity and an impeccable payment record make me a safe and responsible customer. Thank you very much for considering my request.

Sincerely  
Carlos Hernández
