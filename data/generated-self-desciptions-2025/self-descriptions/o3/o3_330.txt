Dear Loans Department,  

My name is Marco Rossi, an Italian national, 31 years old and single, residing for the past two years at Kapellenweg 14, 22525 Hamburg. Since August 2015 I have worked as a certified electronics technician at Siemens AG; my net monthly income averages 3 350 DM. My checking account with your branch (No. 347 998 12) has shown an average closing balance of 450 DM for the last 18 months, and the small appliance loan I took with you in 2020 was repaid three months ahead of schedule.  

I kindly request a loan of 4 473 DM over 36 months to purchase a new smart-TV and DAB+ radio set. The equipment will replace my outdated models and allow my 11-year-old nephew, whom I financially support, to follow his remote-learning broadcasts from Italy. I own a 2017 Volkswagen Polo (fully paid) and a 42 m² condominium for which no mortgage remains. Besides a modest 80 DM savings balance I carry no other debts, guarantors, or installment obligations.  

With eight continuous years at the same employer, a clean repayment record, and a comfortable installment-to-income ratio below 5 %, I am confident of meeting the monthly rate of approximately 128 DM. I am available for questions through my work reception desk.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Ahmet Demir, age 31, single, and have lived at my own apartment at Prenzlauer Allee 96 for exactly two years. Since July 2014 I have served as a senior payroll clerk at the Bezirksamt Pankow, earning a stable net salary of 3 200 DM. For over a year my current account with your bank has never fallen below 300 DM.  

I seek financing of 4 473 DM for 36 months to buy a combined UHD television and digital radio receiver. The purchase supports my ongoing German-language evening courses broadcast on regional television and provides my 9-year-old sister, who relocated here after our parents died, with educational content.  

My credit history shows one previous loan with you for furniture (2 000 DM, 2019-2022) repaid on time. I own a fully paid 2016 Opel Corsa, have no other credits, and only 60 DM on my call-money account. The proposed installment of roughly 125 DM fits comfortably within my budget; after fixed expenses I retain over 1 400 DM monthly.  

I value long-term relationships and intend to keep all banking with you. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmet Demir

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Pedro Alvarez, a Spanish national, 31 years old. For eight years (since May 2017) I have been employed as a laboratory supervisor at Merck KGaA in Darmstadt, drawing a net salary of 3 600 DM. I opened my checking account with you in June 2024; average balance during the last twelve months is 520 DM.  

I request a loan of 4 473 DM, repayable in 36 equal installments, to purchase a 65-inch OLED television and digital receiver. Besides private use, the device will allow my 6-year-old son, whom I raise alone, to participate in the virtual science club broadcast by the Spanish embassy each weekend.  

My earlier 2018 car loan with your bank (8 500 DM) was settled without a single delay by December 2021. I still own the vehicle, a 2018 Ford Focus, and my condominium in Bockenheim is mortgage-free. Apart from a minor 90 DM savings account and no telephone contract, I carry no other liabilities.  

Given my steady employment, low debt, and prior spotless repayment record, I believe I represent minimal risk. I am prepared to sign the necessary documentation at your convenience.  

Kind regards,  
Pedro Alvarez

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Jan Novak, Czech citizen, single, aged 31, residing at my own studio on Tegernseer Landstraße for two years. I have held the position of maintenance supervisor at BMW’s Milbertshofen plant since March 2015, now earning 3 150 DM net. My current account with your bank shows an average monthly surplus of 430 DM over the last 14 months.  

I intend to finance a 4 473 DM purchase of a high-definition smart television and DAB+ radio set, payable over 36 months. The equipment supports both my continuing German vocational training aired on BR-alpha and my 10-year-old cousin’s remote tutoring sessions when he visits on weekends.  

In 2021 I completed repayment of a 3 000 DM renovation loan with your branch, demonstrating punctuality on every installment. I hold no other credits or installment plans. My 2019 Skoda Fabia is fully owned, and I keep a small emergency fund of 70 DM. After monthly costs I am left with over 1 200 DM, making the projected 125 DM installment easily manageable.  

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to provide any further documentation.  

With best regards,  
Jan Novak

Dear Credit Manager,  

My name is Stefan Petrov, Bulgarian citizen, 31 years of age, single, and living for two years in my own loft at Hackstraße 11. Since February 2016 I have worked as a certified sous-chef at the Steigenberger Graf Zeppelin hotel, currently earning 3 000 DM net per month. My checking account (No. 612 774 55) has maintained a minimum balance above 350 DM for the last eighteen months.  

I am applying for a 4 473 DM loan over 36 months to acquire a commercial-grade smart-TV and kitchen radio. The devices will be used both at home and for the culinary video demonstrations I record for the hotel’s training program, which is expanding to online platforms.  

I previously held a 2 200 DM personal loan with your bank in 2019 to purchase professional knives; it was fully repaid by April 2022 without incident. I own a 2016 Renault Clio and have no other debts; savings stand at 85 DM. The planned installment of about 124 DM represents less than 5 % of my income, ensuring ample buffer for unforeseen costs linked to my 5-year-old daughter, whom I support.  

I have built my career on reliability and discipline—qualities I will equally apply to meeting this repayment schedule. Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Petrov
