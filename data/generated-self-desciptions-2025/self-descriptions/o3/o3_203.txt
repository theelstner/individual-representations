Cologne, 15 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ahmed Yilmaz, 27 years old, married to Selin and father of a three-year-old daughter. I have been employed for 2 years and 8 months as a warehouse assistant with DHL Supply Chain in Köln‐Niehl, earning a net income of 2,250 DM per month.  

I am applying for a loan of 1,168 DM to purchase a new Dacia Spring that will allow me to take the early-morning shift reliably. At present my checking account shows an overdraft of 820 DM because I had to replace a broken roof window on the terraced house I inherited from my late father. Apart from that, my finances are stable: a 900 DM furniture loan from your bank was paid off six months ahead of schedule; there are no other debts or guarantors. My wife and I own our home (market value about 140,000 DM) free of mortgage, and we keep a small savings balance of 74 DM.  

With monthly instalments of 100 DM (well within the “rate 4” bracket you proposed), the loan would be settled in twelve months. My permanent contract, spotless repayment record, and real-estate collateral make me a reliable customer.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace phone 0221 / 91 62-312 between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Yilmaz

Munich, 14 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Committee,  

I am Piotr Kowalski, 27, married and father of an infant son. Since March 2024 I have worked as a line cook at Käfer Service in Munich Airport, currently earning 2,100 DM net.  

I request a loan of 1,168 DM to buy a new Škoda Fabia. Public transport no longer covers my split shifts, and reliable mobility will secure my continued employment. My checking account is 260 DM in the red after covering recent hospital fees for my wife’s delivery, yet during the last two years I paid off a 600 DM washing-machine credit from your bank without a single delay.  

We own a small condominium in Freising (valued at 95,000 DM, no mortgage). Other than a symbolic savings balance of 52 DM, I have no outstanding obligations. With a twelve-month plan of roughly 100 DM per month, repayment fits easily into our household budget and leaves a safety margin of 600 DM each month.  

My consistent employment record, prior punctual repayments, and real-estate ownership demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

Stuttgart, 16 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am José Fernandez, a 27-year-old Spanish metalworker employed at Bosch Rexroth in Stuttgart-Feuerbach since July 2022. My net salary averages 2,350 DM.  

The purpose of this application is a 1,168 DM loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e. The car will replace my 20-year-old diesel, reduce commute costs, and allow me to take overtime shifts. My account currently runs an overdraft of 910 DM caused by this year’s property-tax back payment on the small plot and bungalow my wife and I own in Bad Cannstatt (estimated worth 120,000 DM, mortgage-free).  

I previously held a 1,100 DM tool loan at your branch, repaid ahead of schedule last December. I hold no other credits, have one dependent son, and keep a modest savings balance of 88 DM. Repayment over twelve months at 100 DM fits well within my disposable income, which exceeds 700 DM after fixed costs.  

Given my permanent contract, proven repayment discipline, and real-estate collateral, I am confident you will find me a trustworthy applicant.  

Respectfully,  
José Fernandez

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Luka Petrovic, 27, married, with one six-year-old son. I have worked for 3 years and 2 months as a greenhouse technician at Blohm & Vogler Pflanzenhandel in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg, earning 1,980 DM net per month.  

I seek a loan of 1,168 DM to buy a new Fiat Panda. My current vehicle failed inspection, and without a replacement I risk losing punctual attendance bonuses that form a third of my income.  

My checking account shows a negative balance of 600 DM after urgent dental treatment for my son. Savings are minimal (47 DM), yet I own—outright—a small dike-side cottage in Neuallermöhe valued at roughly 110,000 DM. Two years ago I took a 750 DM loan from this bank for a lawn-mower; it was repaid on time. I have no other debts, guarantors, or instalment agreements.  

A repayment schedule of 100 DM monthly over one year represents just 5 percent of my take-home pay and will be serviced by automated transfer on payday. My stable employment, clean credit record, and property ownership underline my reliability.  

Thank you for your trust and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Luka Petrovic

Frankfurt am Main, 15 September 2025  

Honoured Board,  

I am Mohammed Khan, 27, a Pakistani civil engineer now working as an unskilled concrete finisher at Hochtief Baustelle F-25, Frankfurt, since May 2023. My net salary is 2,050 DM; my wife and our two-year-old daughter live with me.  

I am requesting 1,168 DM to purchase a new Renault Twingo, needed to reach rotating building sites at dawn. Lack of transport has already cost me three overtime opportunities last month.  

Currently my Girokonto is 540 DM overdrawn because I prepaid school fees in Karachi for my younger brother. I hold a mere 63 DM in savings. Nevertheless, my credit history is flawless: a 1,000 DM relocation loan from your bank was cleared in ten instalments without delay. I own a half share of a small apartment in Offenbach worth about 90,000 DM, inherited from an uncle, and my family occupies it mortgage-free.  

With a proposed 100 DM repayment over twelve months, the instalment consumes less than 5 percent of my net income, leaving ample buffer. My permanent residence permit, steady employment, real estate, and punctual repayment history make me a safe and loyal customer.  

I look forward to your positive response.  

Yours faithfully,  
Mohammed Khan
