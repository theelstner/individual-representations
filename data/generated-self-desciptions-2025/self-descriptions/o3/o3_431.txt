Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Kovács, a 55-year-old Hungarian citizen who has lived in Cologne for four years. I am divorced and support two adult children who study back home. Although I am currently registered as unemployed, I receive 1 230 DM a month in ALG I benefits and earn about 200 DM monthly from weekend catering jobs.  

I ask for a 1 190 DM loan to repair my 2006 Opel Corsa. The clutch and timing belt have failed, and without the car I cannot accept a factory-cleaning position that starts on 1 August at Reinig GmbH (written confirmation attached). The job will bring a net salary of 1 800 DM and end my reliance on benefits.  

Despite my account occasionally being overdrawn, I have held it here for 18 months and have three small credits with you. All installments—totalling 96 DM per month—have been paid punctually; I have never missed a payment. I propose a 12-month plan at roughly 102 DM per month, leaving sufficient margin in my budget.  

The repair will secure stable income, allowing me to keep meeting every obligation to the bank. Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely  
Maria Kovács

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Elena Popescu, 55, Romanian, and separated. I live rent-free in my sister’s flat in Bremen while caring for my two teenage grandchildren. My only steady income is 1 150 DM in Pflegegeld for caring for my disabled grandson, plus about 300 DM a month from ironing work for a local hotel.  

I urgently need 1 190 DM to repair the household’s central boiler. The heating company Schulte GmbH has issued a binding quote for that amount. A safe, warm flat is mandatory for my grandson’s medical condition; without heat the youth office may relocate him, which would cancel the Pflegegeld and destroy my modest but reliable cash flow.  

Although my checking account was temporarily negative after paying medical bills, I have banked with you for 18 months. I still owe on three small credits, yet every installment has reached you before the due date. No other person is responsible for my debts, and I have no new credit requests elsewhere.  

I can repay this loan in 18 installments of approximately 70 DM, fitting comfortably into my monthly budget. My history of on-time payments is my pledge of trustworthiness.  

Kind regards  
Elena Popescu

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Amina Idrissi, Moroccan, 55 years old, widowed, and a guest worker in Stuttgart since 2019. I live with my cousin, rent-free, and care for my two school-age nieces.  

I request 1 190 DM to overhaul my sewing machines. I previously ran a small alteration service, bringing in 900-1 000 DM per month, but both industrial machines broke down in April. Tailor-Fix GmbH has quoted 1 170 DM plus 20 DM for transport. Once repaired, I already have orders from three boutiques worth at least 800 DM monthly, allowing me to leave unemployment benefits within eight weeks.  

I acknowledge my account is slightly overdrawn and I hold three active micro-loans with you (current balance 640 DM). Nonetheless every payment—totaling 84 DM a month—has been executed via standing order without delay. I have never exceeded the agreed limits.  

If granted, I will add a 60 DM installment over 24 months. My projected net income of 1 700 DM will cover all expenses with a 20 % buffer. My consistent payment history and clear business plan demonstrate I am a dependable borrower.  

Respectfully  
Amina Idrissi

Dear Loan Officers,  

I am Svetlana Petrova, a 55-year-old Bulgarian national, married but living separately. I have resided in Munich for four years and currently receive 1 280 DM monthly unemployment support. In addition, I substitute in a school canteen twice a week, earning about 250 DM.  

The requested credit of 1 190 DM will replace the failed gearbox in our family’s only vehicle, a 2004 Ford Fiesta. My new employer, Aldi Süd, requires mobility because the branch is 27 km away and public transport does not run during my shift. The signed contract (start date 15 July, net salary 1 950 DM) is contingent on my being able to commute.  

Your bank already manages three of my credits. All 18 past installments have been debited punctually. My current liabilities here are 710 DM; no other bank holds my debts. Though my account sometimes shows a negative balance, it has always returned to the approved overdraft limit within the same month.  

I propose repaying the new loan over 12 months at roughly 110 DM. Securing permanent employment will further strengthen my capacity to meet every obligation.  

Thank you for your time and confidence.  

Sincerely  
Svetlana Petrova

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Farah Abbas, 55, Egyptian, divorced, and have lived in Frankfurt since 2020. I reside in my brother’s flat without rent and support two university-age children in Cairo with part of my income.  

I am requesting a 1 190 DM loan to repair the dental laboratory equipment I use for freelance night-shift work. The milling tool and suction motor failed last month; the official service quote is 1 165 DM plus parts. When operational, the lab pays me 1 600–1 800 DM monthly. While the machines are idle my income is limited to 1 140 DM in unemployment benefits.  

For 18 months I have held my main account with your bank and currently service three small loans totaling 820 DM. Each installment (92 DM) has been paid automatically and on schedule—records attached. I owe nothing to other lenders.  

I suggest a 20-month repayment plan of about 70 DM. The restored equipment will immediately restore my higher earnings and keep my budget positive. My spotless repayment record and realistic cash-flow projection make me a reliable candidate.  

With appreciation for your consideration,  
Farah Abbas
