Dortmund, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loans Committee,  

My name is María Sánchez, a 24-year-old Spanish national living and working in Dortmund. For the past 2 years I have been employed full-time as a certified medical laboratory technician at St.-Josef Hospital, earning a net monthly salary of 2 150 €. I own a 38 m² condominium on Gutenbergstraße, purchased with my savings and a small family loan.  

I am requesting a six-month loan of 932 € to purchase a new energy-efficient television and DAB+ radio set. These devices will enable my 4-year-old daughter and me to access German educational programming and improve our language skills.  

Although I once fell thirty days behind on a tuition repayment while relocating to Germany, that balance was fully settled in May 2024 and I have had no late payments since. I already hold a small furniture loan with your bank and have never missed an installment on it. My expenses are modest, I have no additional debts, and my salary comfortably covers the proposed monthly installment of roughly 160 €.  

I maintain a modest cash reserve of 80 €, but no checking account, as most of my transactions are handled via my prepaid salary card. I can, however, open an account with you if the loan is approved. My employer is willing to confirm both my contract and my reliability. With stable employment, property ownership, and a clear repayment plan, I am confident I will meet every obligation.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
María Sánchez

Cologne, 18 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Anna Kowalska, a 24-year-old Polish citizen, separated, and the sole caregiver of my 3-year-old son. For the last 3 years I have worked as a certified industrial electrician at RheinTech GmbH, earning 2 300 € net each month on a permanent contract.  

I wish to borrow 932 € for six months to buy a smart television and digital radio for our newly renovated living room. Besides leisure, the TV will serve as a screen for my evening engineering courses conducted online.  

Two years ago I briefly delayed a mobile-phone installment after an unexpected medical expense, but I paid the balance in full within the same quarter. Since then my payment history has been spotless, including the small appliance loan I currently service with your bank (four payments remaining).  

I own an 85 m² apartment in Cologne-Mülheim, share no other debts, and my monthly budget leaves over 900 € in disposable income—ample to cover the expected 160 € installment. Though I keep less than 100 € in my savings pouch and have not yet opened a checking account, I am prepared to do so with you immediately.  

My steady income, property title, and existing satisfactory relationship with your bank make me a reliable borrower. I appreciate your time and hope for a favorable decision.  

Kind regards,  
Anna Kowalska

Stuttgart, 18 September 2025  

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Chen Lijuan, age 24, married, Chinese national, working as a government-licensed customs officer at Stuttgart Airport since August 2022. My net salary is 2 050 € monthly.  

I seek a 932 € loan over six months to buy a German-language smart TV and a portable radio so that my husband and I can follow local news and integrate faster into the community.  

Last year I overlooked an insurance premium while I was on compulsory quarantine; I settled the arrears within the same month, and there have been no issues since. I have one active renovation loan with your bank, fully current.  

We own a small terraced house in Filderstadt, free of liens. Aside from housing expenses, our monthly surplus is roughly 1 100 €, far exceeding the planned installment. I have no checking account yet because my salary is transferred to a prepaid card issued by the airport authority, but I intend to open an account with you if approved.  

With permanent employment, real-estate collateral, and a consistent payment record, I am confident of meeting this obligation. Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Respectfully,  
Chen Lijuan

Hamburg, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Sofiya Petrova, a 24-year-old Bulgarian divorcee residing in Hamburg-Wandsbek with my 5-year-old daughter. For 1 year and 7 months I have worked as an accredited payroll specialist at Baltic Shipping AG, earning 2 280 € net per month.  

I apply for a 932 € six-month loan to replace our malfunctioning television and add a digital radio. These items are essential for my child’s educational programs and my own remote HR certification course.  

In 2023 a delayed alimony payment caused me to miss one installment on a retail store card; I cleared the entire balance two weeks later and have remained punctual since. My only current credit—your bank’s microloan for household appliances—has been paid on time every month.  

I possess a 40 m² flat registered in my name, freehold. My living costs are low, leaving approximately 800 € a month disposable, more than enough for the projected 160 € repayment. I do not hold a checking account yet but would gladly open one with your institution.  

Given my stable income, property, and repaired credit record, I am confident in my suitability as a borrower. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your reply.  

Warm regards,  
Sofiya Petrova

Esteemed Lending Team,  

I am Fatemeh Rahimi, 24, an Iranian national married with one dependent son. For the past 2 years and 3 months, I have been a certified architectural draftswoman at AlpenBau Consult GmbH, taking home 2 400 € net monthly.  

I request a 932 € loan, repayable in six equal installments, to purchase a UHD television and DAB radio. These devices will support my remote design tutorials and provide educational content for my child.  

In early 2024 I briefly deferred a student-loan payment while finalizing immigration paperwork; the amount was fully repaid within that quarter. Since then all obligations, including the furniture loan I hold with your bank, have been honored on schedule.  

I own a small studio apartment in Munich-Haar, mortgage-free, and carry no other debts. After regular expenses I retain about 1 000 € each month, ensuring an effortless repayment capacity. Though I currently operate without a checking account, I will open one with your bank upon approval.  

My continuous employment, property ownership, and proven repayment history testify to my reliability. Thank you for evaluating my application.  

Sincerely,  
Fatemeh Rahimi
