Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Daniel Kovacs, a 27-year-old Hungarian research laboratory assistant employed by Siemens Healthineers in Berlin since September 2024. I am seeking a loan of 8 648 DM for 24 months to purchase analytical equipment and initial stock for a part-time mobile water-testing service I am starting with a former classmate. The venture already has three signed contracts with local breweries worth roughly 4 000 DM per quarter.

Financially, my gross monthly salary is 3 100 DM; net is 2 150 DM. My fixed costs are 1 000 DM (including the mortgage on the studio apartment I own). I have two existing small consumer loans from this bank (both below 2 000 DM) that I now service punctually after a brief delay last year caused by a relocation. All current payments are up to date and documented.

I hold full ownership of a 2021 Opel Corsa valued at about 10 000 DM, and I have 90 DM in my savings account. Though limited, I have consistently added 40 DM monthly for the past six months. With projected revenue, the requested installment rate of 2 (approx. 360 DM/month) is readily covered by both salary and business cash-flow, leaving a safety margin of 700 DM.

Having lived at my present address for two years, maintained uninterrupted employment, and installed automatic debit for my existing obligations, I trust the bank will view me as a reliable borrower. I am committed to transparent reporting and can provide any additional documentation you require.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Kovacs

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Philipp Stein, a 27-year-old single father of a five-year-old son, currently working as a junior tax officer for the Stuttgart municipal administration since April 2024. I respectfully request a 24-month loan of 8 648 DM to acquire a used Mercedes Vito and basic inventory for a weekend courier service I plan to operate under the name “CityNight Parcels.”

My monthly net salary is 2 400 DM. All living expenses, including the mortgage on my one-room condominium, total 1 250 DM. Two small educational loans (1 300 DM each) with your bank are serviced without delay after a short setback two years ago. I have no guarantors or other debts.

Aside from the apartment, I own a 2018 VW Polo (6 000 DM market value) and keep a symbolic 50 DM in a savings booklet. Although modest, my property base and permanent civil-service contract underline my repayment ability. Expected courier income is 1 000–1 200 DM per month, allowing me to meet the 360 DM installment comfortably.

I have resided at the same address for exactly two years and can be reached any time at the registered phone number. I look forward to proving my renewed creditworthiness.

Kind regards,  
Philipp Stein

Dear Lending Manager,

My name is Luca Donati, an Italian national who has lived in Hamburg for two years. Since January 2024 I have been employed as an IT support technician at Airbus, earning 2 600 DM net per month. I request a loan of 8 648 DM over 24 months to fit out a shared co-working space that I am establishing with two colleagues focused on freelance programmers.

I acknowledge a brief repayment delay on a furniture loan in 2023; all arrears were cleared six months ago, and the schedule is now automatic. My two current credits with your institution are below 1 500 DM each and will be fully paid within eight months.

I own a 2020 Ford Fiesta (valued at roughly 8 500 DM) and a self-occupied micro-apartment financed through another bank. Savings are limited (about 70 DM), but I regularly set aside 5 % of my salary. After deducting living costs of 1 200 DM, I retain more than twice the 2-rate installment (approx. 360 DM).

Airbus provides a renewable three-year contract, and my start-up already pre-leased five desks that will generate at least 600 DM monthly from November onward. This dual income secures repayment.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I am available for questions and can furnish all supporting documents promptly.

Best regards,  
Luca Donati

To the Credit Department,

I am Jonas Krämer, a 27-year-old automotive paint technician at BMW Leipzig since June 2024. I seek an 8 648 DM loan for 24 months to acquire a computerized spray booth and rent a small workshop where I will offer custom motorcycle paint jobs on weekends.

My current net salary is 2 350 DM. Monthly expenses, inclusive of mortgage payments on my single-room condominium, are 1 150 DM. I have two minor installment credits (domestic appliances) with your bank totaling 2 800 DM; after an isolated payment delay in 2023, I switched to direct debit and have had zero issues.

Assets include a fully paid 2019 Skoda Octavia valued near 9 000 DM, and 95 DM in a youth savings account. The projected workshop turnover of 800 DM a month will comfortably cover the 360 DM installment and leave surplus funds for family needs—my dependent younger brother who lives with me while in vocational school.

I have lived at my current residence for two years and can provide BMW employment verification, workshop pre-orders, and insurance certificates. I value my relationship with the bank and stand ready to fulfill all conditions.

Respectfully,  
Jonas Krämer

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Marcel Nguyen, a 27-year-old single software quality analyst at Deutsche Telekom in Bonn since August 2024. I request an 8 648 DM business loan over 24 months to launch an e-commerce store specializing in refurbished smartphones. The funds will cover initial stock procurement, web development costs, and a secondhand delivery van.

Income: 2 750 DM net per month. Expenses, including the mortgage on my 28-m² apartment, child support for my three-year-old daughter, and utilities, stand at 1 350 DM. I have two existing credits with this bank totaling 3 000 DM, historically delayed once in early 2023 during a relocation; since instituting standing orders, all payments have been on time.

Assets comprise a 2018 Audi A3 (value approx. 9 500 DM) and modest savings of 60 DM that grow by 50 DM monthly. Estimated online-store profit, based on signed supplier agreements, is 900 DM per month, comfortably exceeding the 360 DM installment rate.

I have maintained residence at the same Bonn address for two years and possess a registered landline and mobile in my name. My combined salaried and business income, verifiable references, and commitment to automated repayment underscore my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to a positive response.

Sincerely,  
Marcel Nguyen
