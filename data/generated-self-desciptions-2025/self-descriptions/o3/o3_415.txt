Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Thomas Becker, 40 years old, single, warehouse forklift operator at Baden Cargo GmbH since March 2022. My net income averages 2 450 DM per month and is contractually secured. I am applying for a 1 597 DM loan, to be repaid over ten months at the 3 % installment rate, to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to get to the night shift reliably and bring my two sons (aged 7 and 11) to school on my custody days.

Although I do not keep a checking account, I have a savings account at your branch with a current balance of 640 DM. In 2021 I took a 2 000 DM consumer loan from you and repaid it three months ahead of schedule, so my payment record with the bank is spotless. I rent my flat and have no other debts, guarantees, or installment plans.

The requested amount is modest compared with my steady income, and the ten-month term keeps the monthly rate below 170 DM, comfortably within my budget. I am confident I can honor each payment and would be happy to supply pay slips or references.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Thomas Becker

Esteemed Officers,

I am Markus Klein, aged 40, working full-time as a porter at Hotel Bavaria Plaza since July 2021. I respectfully request a loan of 1 597 DM for the purchase of a new Škoda Fabia. Reliable transportation will allow me to accept early-morning and late-night shifts that public transit cannot cover, thereby increasing my income potential.

My monthly net salary is 2 230 DM, supplemented by average tips of 250 DM. I hold 720 DM in a savings book with your institution. I have no checking account, credit cards, or standing installment plans. In 2022 I settled a 1 500 DM furniture loan with you without a single late payment, as reflected in my credit file.

I rent a one-bedroom apartment where my two daughters (ages 8 and 10) stay on weekends. With housing costs of 650 DM and living expenses carefully budgeted, the planned ten-month repayment of approximately 165 DM fits easily into my monthly cash flow.

My established employment, clean repayment record, and modest savings demonstrate my reliability. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss any additional documentation you may need.

Kind regards,
Markus Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Sebastian Wolf, 40, single father of two, have been employed as a packing-line operator at FrankenFoods AG since October 2021. I earn a net 2 100 DM per month and request a 1 597 DM loan over ten months to finance a new Dacia Sandero. Owning a dependable vehicle will shorten my daily commute from 90 to 25 minutes and make overtime shifts feasible.

I currently keep 590 DM in a savings account at your bank. In November 2023 I completed a 1 800 DM appliance loan with you, repaid exactly on schedule. My rental agreement is stable, and I hold no other debts or guarantees.

The proposed monthly installment of about 165 DM represents less than eight percent of my take-home pay, leaving ample cushion for household needs. My consistent employment, punctual payment history, and existing relationship with your bank support my request.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am ready to supply payslips, employment confirmation, or any other information you require.

Respectfully,
Sebastian Wolf

Loan Department,

My name is David Berger, 40, working as a night security guard at RuhrSecure GmbH since May 2022. I apply for a 1 597 DM loan, repayable in ten monthly installments, to purchase a new Kia Picanto. The car is essential for commuting to rotating sites during late hours when buses are unavailable.

My net income is 2 380 DM monthly, complemented by an annual night-shift bonus. I maintain 655 DM in a savings pass at your branch. In 2020 I borrowed 2 300 DM from you for dental expenses and repaid it one month early, leaving my credit record impeccable.

I rent a modest flat and have no outstanding obligations, co-signatures, or credit cards. Caring financially for two nephews who live with my sister, I budget prudently; the planned 3 % installment, roughly 165 DM per month, is well within my means.

I trust that my stable employment and proven repayment reliability make me a sound candidate. I look forward to a favorable reply.

Yours faithfully,
David Berger

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Patrick Neumann, 40 years old, employed as a municipal groundskeeper for the City of Leipzig since January 2023. I seek a 1 597 DM loan to be repaid over ten months at your standard 3 % rate, intended for purchasing a new Fiat Panda. Reliable transport will help me reach multiple work sites each morning and allow weekend visits with my two children.

My steady municipal salary nets 2 150 DM monthly. I hold 675 DM in a savings bond with your bank and have no checking account. In 2022 I successfully completed repayment of a 1 600 DM education loan from this branch, without default or delay.

I rent a two-room apartment, have no other debts, and do not act as guarantor for anyone. With housing expenses of 600 DM, utilities of 180 DM, and prudent living costs, the projected 165 DM monthly installment is comfortably affordable.

Given my public-sector employment, clean credit history, and existing savings, I am confident of meeting all obligations. I would be pleased to provide further documentation at your convenience.

Sincerely,
Patrick Neumann
