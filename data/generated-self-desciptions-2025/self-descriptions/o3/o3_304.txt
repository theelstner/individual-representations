Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Milos Petrovic, a Croatian national who has lived and worked in Stuttgart since April 2019. For the past four years and eleven months I have been employed as a forklift operator at Schwaben Logistik GmbH, earning a net salary of 2 450 DM that is paid directly into my checking account with your branch. My balance has remained above 650 DM for the last eighteen months.

I am requesting a loan of 1 344 DM over 24 months to finance a new Opel Corsa that will replace my fifteen-year-old van. Reliable transport is essential to reach the late and weekend shifts at the warehouse; public buses do not cover the industrial zone during those hours.

Although I currently service two small credits with your bank (both repaid on schedule) and one furniture loan with SüdWest Bank, my total monthly credit obligation—including the requested car loan—will not exceed 18 % of my take-home pay. I own a modest condominium at König-Wilhelm-Straße 27, valued at approximately 110 000 DM, providing additional security.

I have never missed a payment, and my employer can confirm the stability of my contract. With nearly five years of continuous employment, a dependable income, and real-estate collateral, I trust that I meet your standards for reliability. I look forward to your positive reply and am available at the branch office for any clarification.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Milos Petrovic

To the Credit Department,

I am Gheorghe Ionescu, single, 37, currently working as a kitchen assistant at Charité Campus Virchow in Berlin since December 2018. My average net income of 2 200 DM is credited to my checking account at your bank, which has held a minimum balance of 400 DM for the past fourteen months.

I seek a 1 344 DM loan, repayable in 24 monthly installments of 60 DM, to purchase a new Dacia Sandero. The vehicle will cut my weekly commute by two hours and allow me to take on occasional overtime shifts that begin before the U-Bahn operates.

Financially, I maintain two existing installment loans with your institution (both in good standing) and a household appliance loan with Berliner Sparkasse. Including the requested car payment, my monthly installments will total 380 DM, well below the 900 DM maximum deemed affordable by my budget. I own a small terraced house in Pankow, bought in 2021, which is nearly half paid off and currently valued at 145 000 DM.

Despite being classified once as “critical” after a delayed energy bill in 2020, all obligations have been rectified, and no further issues have arisen. My permanent residency status is in place, and the hospital has issued a letter confirming my long-term employment.

I am confident that my steady cash flow, property ownership, and transparent repayment record make me a low-risk candidate. I appreciate your time and await your favorable decision.

Respectfully,
Gheorghe Ionescu

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Julio Martín, a Spanish mason employed by Bau-Plus AG in Munich since September 2017. I earn 2 600 DM net per month, and for the last two years my checking account at your bank has never dropped below 500 DM.

I wish to finance a new Ford Fiesta for 1 344 DM over 24 months. Construction sites rotate across the region, and dependable personal transport is mandatory; my current car broke down twice last winter, causing missed hours and lost wages.

My liabilities consist of two active credits with your bank (home insulation and education expenses for my twins) and a small revolving line with Sparkasse München. Total monthly repayments—including the requested loan—will stand at 420 DM, equal to 16 % of my income. I own a 90 m² apartment in Sendling valued at 175 000 DM, registered free of liens.

Over the past six years I have never defaulted, and salary assignments have been in place with your bank since 2020. My employer can attest to my good standing and has provided a letter guaranteeing continued employment for at least the next 18 months, covering the bulk of the loan term.

I trust that my stable work record, solid collateral, and clear repayment plan demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for reviewing my application.

Kind regards,
Julio Martín

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed Musa, a Nigerian citizen residing in Hamburg for two years. Since May 2020 I have held a full-time post as a street-cleaning operative with the Hamburg Stadtreinigung, earning 2 150 DM net each month, paid directly into my checking account with your bank. My ending balance has never fallen below 350 DM during the last year.

I request a 1 344 DM loan, payable over 24 months, to buy a new Toyota Aygo. The shift schedule begins at 4 a.m., when public transit is sporadic; reliable transport will prevent tardiness and safeguard my income.

I currently service two punctual loans with your bank and one small credit-card balance at Commerzbank. After adding the proposed installment of 60 DM, my total monthly debt service will be 310 DM, well within my budget. I purchased a small townhouse in Wilhelmsburg in 2022 for 120 000 DM; the property provides additional security.

Although my credit file once showed a “critical” mark due to an overdraft in 2021, it was cleared within a month. Since then I have maintained perfect payment history. My employer has confirmed my contract through 2028, and I have no guarantors or dependents beyond my two nieces who live with me.

Your support will help me continue a dependable work record. I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further information.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Musa

To the Lending Committee,

My name is Bogdan Kovalenko, Ukrainian national, single, age 37. For four years and two months I have been employed as a janitorial supervisor at Frankfurt Airport, earning 2 300 DM net which is deposited into my current account with your bank. The account has maintained an average balance of 480 DM for fifteen consecutive months.

I am applying for a 1 344 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new Skoda Fabia. A reliable car is a prerequisite for the split shifts required at the airport, especially during night operations when regional trains stop running.

My existing obligations include two small loans with your bank—both serviced on time—and a personal loan with Volksbank Frankfurt taken for home renovations. After adding the new installment of roughly 60 DM, my monthly repayments will total 370 DM, representing 16 % of my net income. I own a modest duplex in Niederrad valued at 130 000 DM, offering tangible collateral.

I understand the importance of creditworthiness; despite a past “critical” notation from a delayed mobile contract in 2020, my record has been clean since. Salary assignment in favor of your bank has been filed with my employer, and my contract is permanent.

With stable employment, property ownership, and a solid repayment track record, I believe I am a trustworthy applicant. Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
Bogdan Kovalenko
