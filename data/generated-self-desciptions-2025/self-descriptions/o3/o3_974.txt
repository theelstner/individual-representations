Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a 1 193 DM loan to purchase a reliable used Opel Corsa. After four years in Berlin, I have just signed a two–year contract as a kitchen assistant at St. Hedwig Hospital, starting 1 July. A car is essential because my shifts begin before public transport runs and the hospital lies 28 km outside the city.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 83 DM and my savings stand at 46 DM, I have demonstrated sound repayment discipline: the 650 DM language-course loan (2018) and the 900 DM laptop loan (2020) you granted me were both repaid in full and on time. My brother-in-law, Javier López, a permanent Deutsche Bahn employee, has agreed to co-sign and cover installments should an emergency arise.

My net salary will be 1 980 DM per month; the proposed 24-month plan costs me less than 3 % of that income, leaving ample room for living expenses and support of my six-year-old son. I therefore trust you will view me as a low-risk, motivated borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Torres

Dear Loan Committee,

I request financing of 1 193 DM to buy a 2015 Ford Fiesta. The vehicle will allow me to attend a state-funded retraining course in Rosenheim that begins next month and to seek work across Upper Bavaria.

My last job—eight years as a supermarket cashier—ended when the chain closed. Since then I have lived on 1 260 DM monthly unemployment benefit, keeping my account deficit to 54 DM and my savings at 31 DM. Importantly, the two micro-loans you granted me (2017 household appliances, 2021 dental expenses) were both cleared ahead of schedule.

My fiancé and co-applicant, Marko Knežević, is a certified electrician earning 3 200 DM net. He will guarantee the payments of 52 DM per month, which we have already set aside in a joint budget. With one dependent child and low fixed rents, our household has adequate reserves.

My spotless repayment history and Marko’s stable income make me a dependable candidate.

Kind regards,  
Aleksandra Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to finance a second-hand Renault Clio (purchase price 1 193 DM) and seek your support for a 24-month loan. Beginning 15 June, I will return to full-time work as a hotel receptionist at the Maritim Airport Hotel after a pandemic-related layoff.

During unemployment I conscientiously managed my finances: my checking account shows –72 DM and I hold 58 DM in savings. I have never missed a payment with your bank—the 2019 1 000 DM relocation loan and the 2022 750 DM childcare loan were both repaid exactly on schedule.

My husband, Nikolay Ivanov, a machinist with Bosch (net income 2 800 DM), is the co-applicant. Our combined income comfortably covers the planned 50 DM monthly installment while supporting our four-year-old daughter.

Given my clean credit record, forthcoming employment contract and my husband’s backing, I believe I meet all requirements for this modest loan.

Thank you for your positive consideration.

Respectfully,  
Tatyana Ivanova

Dear Loan Department,

I am requesting a 1 193 DM loan to purchase a small Toyota Yaris. The car will enable me to accept piece-work sewing jobs in neighboring towns and transport my eight-year-old son to school.

I previously worked nine years at Weiss & Sohn Textiles until the factory closed last autumn. While receiving 1 100 DM monthly unemployment assistance I kept my overdraft to 61 DM, and I maintain 42 DM in a savings book. The bank’s earlier credits to me—800 DM for vocational tools (2016) and 950 DM for a language course (2020)—were both settled early.

My sister, Mai Tran, a certified geriatric nurse earning 2 900 DM monthly, will act as co-applicant and has already agreed to cover the 50 DM installment if necessary. I am currently finalizing a part-time translation contract that will raise my personal income to about 1 600 DM.

My steady repayment record, family support and imminent earnings render me a safe borrower.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your approval.

Sincerely,  
Lien Nguyen

Dear Credit Officer,

I hereby apply for a 1 193 DM loan to acquire a used VW Up! that will let me complete evening classes in computer networking and reach potential employers in the suburbs.

I have lived in Hamburg for four years, paying rent punctually despite an overdraft of 79 DM and only 37 DM in savings. Your bank has twice trusted me—700 DM for medical costs (2018) and 1 050 DM for a childcare laptop (2021)—and I repaid both without delay.

Though currently registered unemployed, I receive 1 250 DM monthly benefit and have secured an internship at HafenTech GmbH starting 1 August, with a promised net salary of 2 100 DM thereafter. My elder sister, Amira El-Sayed, a primary-school teacher earning 2 700 DM, is willing to co-sign; together we have budgeted the 50 DM monthly repayment.

Given my flawless history with your institution, the modest loan size and the added security of a salaried guarantor, I trust you will find my application persuasive.

Thank you for your consideration.

Warm regards,  
Sarah Ahmed
