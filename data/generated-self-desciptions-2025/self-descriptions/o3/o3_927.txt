Letter 1 – Andreas Keller, Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Andreas Keller. I am 46 years old, single, and the father of a 12-year-old daughter who lives with me every second weekend. Since April of this year I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Karlsruhe, earning a net salary of 3,000 DM per month.  

I request a 12-month loan of 697 DM to cover the last balance needed for a new Volkswagen Polo. Reliable transportation is essential for my daily 28 km commute to the institute and for taking my daughter to school events.

Although my current checking account stands at –123 DM and my savings amount to 74 DM, I have repaid two earlier loans with your bank (a laptop loan in 2020 and a bicycle loan in 2022) on schedule and without incident. I own a small condominium in Karlsruhe, have no other debts, and my monthly expenses leave a surplus of roughly 950 DM, more than enough to cover the installment of 4 DM per month.

I have maintained a land-line with you on record and am registered as a permanent resident. My consistent repayment history and stable professional outlook make me a dependable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
Andreas Keller  



Letter 2 – Markus Stein, Certified HVAC Technician

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Markus Stein, 46, single, and the custodial parent of my 10-year-old son Leon, ask for a loan of 697 DM over 12 months to finance a new Ford Fiesta. As a certified HVAC technician hired by Klima-Tec GmbH eight months ago, I travel to client sites across Stuttgart and the surrounding region. The car is indispensable for my work; without it, I cannot meet service appointments that generate my income.

My net monthly income is 3,400 DM. Presently my checking account is –95 DM and my savings are 52 DM. I have already completed two contracts with your bank—both repaid early—which established my creditworthiness. I own my detached house in Waiblingen (no mortgage), have no guarantors or additional debt, and my existing internal installment plan (4 DM per month) is always paid on time.

With a steady job, property ownership, and a flawless repayment record, I trust you will view me as a low-risk applicant. I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Markus Stein  



Letter 3 – Tobias Richter, Municipal Administrative Officer

Esteemed Credit Department,

My name is Tobias Richter, age 46, municipal administrative officer with the Town Hall of Lübeck since January of this year. My net income is 2,850 DM per month. I respectfully apply for a 697 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa. Public transport schedules do not align with my shift hours, and reliable personal transport will ensure punctuality and allow weekend visits to my 14-year-old son in Kiel.

Financial snapshot: checking account balance –142 DM; savings 81 DM. I fully repaid two previous loans with your bank (2019 and 2021). I own a compact car (soon to be traded in) and a mortgage-free terraced house, have resided there for two years, and hold no other credit lines. After fixed costs, I retain about 900 DM monthly—ample to satisfy the 4 DM installments.

Your bank’s trust has always been met with timely repayment; I hope to continue this partnership.

With respect,  
Tobias Richter  



Letter 4 – Jörg Novak, Customs Officer

Dear Loan Officers,

I am Jörg Novak, 46, single, employed as a customs officer at Hamburg Airport since November last year. I earn 3,200 DM net per month. I seek a 697 DM, 12-month loan to complete the purchase of a new Skoda Fabia. The vehicle will replace my aging car and guarantee my 40-minute commute across the Elbe tunnel regardless of night-shift hours.

Current finances: checking account –88 DM, savings 69 DM. Your bank has twice entrusted me with credit—both paid ahead of schedule. I own a two-year-old condominium in Harburg (no outstanding mortgage) and carry no other liabilities besides a small 4 DM internal installment plan, which is up-to-date.

My civil-service position provides secure income; my payment history demonstrates reliability. I thank you for reviewing my request.

Faithfully,  
Jörg Novak  



Letter 5 – Sebastian Hoffmann, IT Support Specialist

To the Credit Committee,

I, Sebastian Hoffmann, 46 years old and single, have worked as an IT support specialist at Deutsche-Net Systems in Frankfurt since last December, earning 3,050 DM net per month. I am applying for a 697 DM loan repayable over 12 months to finance a new Renault Clio. The car is vital for on-site emergency calls as part of our 24/7 service contracts and for transporting my 8-year-old daughter during my custody weekends.

My checking account currently shows –117 DM; I hold 63 DM in a savings passbook. I have completed two previous loans with your bank—one for professional certification fees, the other for household appliances—each paid without delay. I own my apartment in Offenbach (acquired two years ago), have no co-signers or external debts, and my only other payment obligation with you is a 4 DM installment that is always settled on the due date.

With stable employment in a growth sector, property ownership, and an unblemished repayment record, I am confident of meeting every obligation associated with this loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Sebastian Hoffmann
