Frankfurt, 17 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Jan-Eric Becker, age 32, single with two children. For the past two years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Darmstadt, earning a steady net income of 2 800 € per month. I own a small condominium in Offenbach (fully paid off, market value approx. 145 000 €).

I am requesting a business loan of 2 978 € for 24 months to buy a desktop-size 3-D printer and CNC router that will let me turn my hobby of prototyping replacement parts into a weekend micro-enterprise. Orders from three local engineering firms are already lined up.

Although one of my older consumer loans was repaid two weeks late in 2022, both current instalments with your bank have been debited punctually ever since. I keep no checking account today but will open one with you so repayments are automated.

My real estate collateral, solid salary and flawless payment record over the last 30 months demonstrate reliability. I look forward to expanding our relationship and am available for any additional information.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Jan-Eric Becker

To the Credit Department,

I am Ahmed Mustafa, a certified automotive mechanic employed at AutoKraus GmbH for three years, earning 2 650 € net monthly. I own the townhouse at Müllerstraße 77, valued at roughly 190 000 €, where I live with my two young sons.

I seek a 24-month loan of 2 978 € to purchase a used tyre-balancing machine and portable compressor to launch a mobile tyre-change service aimed at small fleets. The first client, a bakery chain with nine vans, has signed a letter of intent worth at least 900 € per month.

Two existing instalment loans with your bank are being repaid on schedule; the only blemish in my credit file is a late payment in 2021 caused by a payroll error that was quickly rectified. I do not keep a current account but will gladly open one to streamline future payments.

Stable employment, property ownership and confirmed demand for the new service make me a dependable borrower. I appreciate your favourable review.

Kind regards,
Ahmed Mustafa

Cologne, 17 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Carlos da Silva, 32, single father of two. I have served as a municipal clerk for the City of Cologne for 19 months, earning 2 720 € net. I own a mortgage-free apartment in Ehrenfeld valued at about 160 000 €.

I request a loan of 2 978 € over 24 months to purchase kitchen equipment and a used trailer for a weekend “Arepas on Wheels” food-truck, already approved by the municipal health office. A stand space has been reserved at the Saturday market, projected to add 600–700 € in weekly revenue.

I acknowledge one delayed card payment in late 2022; since then, my two active loans with your bank have been serviced flawlessly via automatic debit. I presently operate without a checking account and will formalise one with your institution to ensure transparent repayments.

Between secure civil-service employment, owned real estate and tangible business prospects, I believe I present minimal risk. Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,
Carlos da Silva

Hamburg, 17 September 2025

Esteemed Credit Team,

I am Marek Kozłowski, network technician at Lufthansa Systems Hamburg since February 2023, drawing a net salary of 2 900 € monthly. I live in and own a small detached house in Wilhelmsburg (current appraisal 205 000 €) with my two children.

I am applying for a 2 978 € business loan repayable over 24 months to purchase initial inventory and marketing for an e-commerce shop specialising in drone spare parts. Agreements with two suppliers are signed, and pilot sales on an online marketplace already average 450 € monthly.

While I experienced a payment delay on a consumer loan three years ago, both existing credits with your bank have been settled before due date for the past 28 months. I do not maintain a checking account yet but will open one to assure automatic instalment transfers.

My steady IT position, homeowner status and proven market demand confirm my creditworthiness. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
Marek Kozłowski

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025

Dear Loan Officers,

I am Li Wei, age 32, single with two dependents, employed as a master electrician at EnerVolt AG for one year and eight months, earning 2 750 € net per month. I own my residence in Bad Cannstatt, valued at around 180 000 €.

I request a 2 978 € loan for 24 months to acquire professional crimping tools and a ladder lift needed to start a side business installing small rooftop solar panels. Six homeowners in my neighbourhood have already signed preliminary contracts worth 5 400 € in total.

My credit file shows a delayed payment in 2021 during a parental leave period; since then, both active loans with your bank have been paid punctually. I currently operate without a checking account but intend to open one with you for seamless instalment collection.

With technical expertise, secured income and real estate collateral, I am confident I meet your lending standards. Thank you for evaluating my application.

Sincerely,
Li Wei
