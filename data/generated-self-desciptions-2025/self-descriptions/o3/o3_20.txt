Stuttgart, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Hoffmann, 44, divorced, and for the past nine years I have managed the Edeka Markt in Bad Cannstatt. I am requesting a loan of 12 579 DM, to be repaid over 24 months, in order to purchase a reliable 2019 VW Golf Variant with 42 000 km. The car is essential for my daily visits to regional suppliers and for transporting my twelve-year-old son between school and after-care.  

Financially I stand on solid ground. My net salary averages 5 800 DM per month; housing is provided by the company, so my living costs are low. My current checking balance fluctuates around 120 DM and my savings account holds 60 DM, as I prefer to keep funds working. I carry one existing credit with your bank—3 000 DM for new refrigeration units—on which every installment has been paid punctually. I have never missed a payment in my career.  

With a long, stable employment record, verifiable income, and an excellent payment history, I am confident of meeting the proposed monthly installments of roughly 540 DM. Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 0711-645 88 23 for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Sabine Keller, 44, separated, and owner of KellerKonten Buchhaltungsservice. For ten years I have provided bookkeeping to more than 60 local firms. To expand my client reach I need a well-maintained 2020 Ford Transit Connect (54 000 km); therefore I request a loan of 12 579 DM over 24 months.  

My average monthly turnover is 18 000 DM, yielding a net personal income of about 6 400 DM. I live rent-free in my sister’s townhouse, so fixed expenses are modest. My checking account usually holds around 150 DM, and my savings account 70 DM, as earnings are reinvested in the business. I have one earlier credit with your bank—2 200 DM for office furniture—fully paid on schedule. I carry no other debts and have never had a delay reported.  

Given my stable self-employment, low household costs, and spotless credit history, I am confident I can meet a monthly installment near 540 DM. I would be grateful for your positive decision. You can reach me anytime at 040-331 52 89.  

Kind regards,  
Sabine Keller

To the Credit Department,  

I am Dr. Claudia Nguyen, 44, married, senior research engineer at Siemens Mobility since 2017. I seek a 12 579 DM loan for 24 months to acquire a 2018 Toyota Corolla Hybrid (48 500 km). The vehicle will allow me to commute between the testing site in Augsburg and my daughter’s school in Munich without relying on rentals.  

My net monthly income is 7 200 DM plus an annual bonus. Company-owned housing on campus is provided at no charge, leaving ample disposable income. Current account balance is 95 DM; savings account 85 DM. I previously held a 6 000 DM computer equipment loan with your bank, repaid flawlessly last year. I have no other liabilities and possess a consistent record of timely payments.  

With eight years of continuous employment, strong salary, and minimal living expenses, I can comfortably service the expected 540 DM monthly installment. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this further and can be reached at 089-455-66 17.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Claudia Nguyen
