Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a €1 520 personal loan to purchase ergonomic desks, filing cabinets, and a replacement laptop for my home office. For the past eight years I have worked as a senior maintenance supervisor at the Frankfurt Port Authority, earning a net monthly salary of approximately €3 400. Although I have no current checking account with your bank, my salary is paid regularly into my building-society savings plan, and I service one existing auto loan with another institution punctually (remaining balance €4 800, 18 months left).

My financial obligations are modest: I own my condominium outright, have no other installment plans, and support one adult son who is completing university. My credit file shows a critical note from 2019 caused by a delayed insurance reimbursement, but all payments have since been made and the account is closed.  

Because I have been employed with the same public entity for almost a decade, my income is secure. In addition, my life-insurance policy (€45 000 surrender value) provides extra collateral. I therefore feel confident that the proposed 15-month repayment schedule with an installment of roughly €110 fits comfortably within my budget.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my office number +49 69 338 2211 should you require any clarification.

Sincerely,  
Antonio Ferreira

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a €1 520 loan for the purchase of new laboratory-grade security scanners and shelving needed to upgrade the storage room in my owner-occupied flat. I have been employed as a customs officer at Frankfurt International Airport for ten years, with a stable net income of €3 100 per month.

I maintain one existing credit with your bank (originally €6 000, balance €1 250, never in arrears) and a small education loan at another institution. I chose not to open a checking account because my wages are transferred directly to a home-country account where I support my widowed mother, my sole dependent.

My residence in Germany is now in its fourth year and I hold a permanent work permit. I possess a building-society savings agreement worth €18 700 that will mature in three years, as well as a life-insurance policy naming my mother as beneficiary. With housing fully paid and no other installment plans, the proposed monthly rate of approximately €110 over 15 months is easily affordable.

I have attached proof of income and residence. I look forward to a favorable response and am happy to provide further documentation.

Kind regards,  
Viktor Ivanov

Esteemed Credit Committee,

I wish to obtain a €1 520 loan to replace aging workshop benches and acquire an industrial sewing machine for my hobby carpentry and upholstery room. Since 2016 I have served as a certified surveying technician for the municipal land-registry office, earning €3 250 net monthly.

Despite not having a checking account with your institution, I have built a reliable track record: one small travel loan with you (paid to date) and a mortgage fully amortized in 2021. A 2022 missed payment on a retailer card marked my file as “critical,” but it was settled within 30 days and no further issues have arisen.

I live alone with my 23-year-old daughter, whom I still support during her apprenticeship. Thanks to owning my house outright and carrying no consumer debts, my disposable income exceeds €1 400 each month, more than sufficient to cover the planned €110 installment.

Collateral comprises a life-insurance policy (€52 000 insured sum) and a dormant savings contract with Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall. I am committed to punctual repayment and welcome any additional questions.

Respectfully,  
Miguel Costa

Dear Credit Department,

Please accept my application for a €1 520 furniture and equipment loan. I intend to purchase an adjustable hospital-grade bed and specialized exercise gear to accommodate my recent back surgery and enable work-from-home duties.

I have been the senior IT administrator for the City of Frankfurt public health offices for twelve years, drawing a dependable net salary of €3 600 per month. I own my house, hold a LV-1871 life-insurance policy (€60 000), and maintain a building-society savings contract currently valued at €21 000.

Apart from one education loan with your bank (outstanding balance €980, never late), I have no other installment obligations. My credit file indicates a “critical” rating due to a seven-year-old telecommunications dispute, which was resolved in 2020. I do not operate a checking account locally because of religious banking preferences, but all wages are routed through my employer’s disbursement card.

With fixed costs of €1 500 per month, the additional €110 installment over 15 months is fully manageable. I am a permanent resident, single, and provide financial assistance to my disabled brother abroad, my only dependent.

Thank you for evaluating my request. I am ready to supply any further information.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Khan

To the Lending Team,

I hereby apply for a €1 520 consumer loan to outfit my newly renovated den with shelving, lighting, and a workstation that will allow me to continue part-time consulting after retirement. For the last fifteen years I have been employed as a postal service inspector, earning €3 050 net per month.

I currently service one personal loan with your bank (balance €1 100) and a small refinancing credit at my home-country bank. All payments have been met on time. I do not keep a checking account in Germany because my salary is automatically split between my life-insurance policy premiums and international transfers that support my adult niece, my dependent.

I reside in my own apartment, occupied continuously for four years, and possess a Bausparvertrag of €19 000. Although my Schufa record lists a “critical account” from 2018, that debt was paid in full and closed the same year.

My budget leaves more than €1 200 surplus monthly, making the proposed 15-month repayment plan entirely realistic. I value the relationship I already have with your bank and would be grateful to expand it through this loan.

Sincerely,  
Jan Novak
