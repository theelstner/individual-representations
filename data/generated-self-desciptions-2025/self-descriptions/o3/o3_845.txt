Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Santini, an Italian engineer employed as a maintenance supervisor at RheinMain Railways GmbH in Mainz. I have worked in this position for five years and earn a net monthly salary of 4,300 EUR. I am requesting a business loan of 1,559 EUR to purchase a second-hand CNC lathe that will allow me to start a small weekend machining service in my home garage. The machine has already been sourced, and this modest sum will cover its full cost plus delivery.  

Although I do not keep a checking account, I have held a savings passbook with your bank for three years (current balance 87 DM). In 2022 I took a 2,000 EUR renovation loan with you and repaid the entire amount six months ahead of schedule. I own my townhouse outright and my 2017 Volkswagen Transporter, so I can comfortably meet the agreed monthly installment of 4 % without jeopardizing my living costs or the welfare of my teenage son.  

My steady employment, spotless repayment record, and personal asset base make me a reliable borrower. I look forward to contributing to the local economy with this micro-enterprise and to continuing our positive relationship.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Santini

To the Credit Department,  

I am Dragan Petrovic, a Serbian national residing in Heidelberg since 2021. For the past four years I have worked as a certified customs officer at the Baden-Württemberg Main Customs Office, earning 4,100 EUR net each month. I kindly apply for a 1,559 EUR business loan to cover start-up legal and web development costs for “Danube Import Consulting,” a sideline service I have registered with the local trade office to assist Balkan exporters entering the German market.  

Your bank granted me a 3,500 EUR car loan in 2020, which I repaid in full and on time earlier this year. I own my apartment (paid off in 2019) and my 2016 Skoda Superb. I keep less than 100 DM in a traditional savings book but maintain a stable cash reserve in my salary account held at the federal treasury. With no other debts and only one dependent—my mother living with me—I can easily service the required 4 % installments via automated transfer.  

My civil-service status, consistent income, and proven repayment history underscore my reliability. I appreciate your favorable review of my request.  

Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Peter Hoffmann, a 50-year-old master electrician employed by Energieversorgung Köln AG since April 2019. My net monthly income is 4,250 EUR. I seek a loan of 1,559 EUR to purchase specialized testing equipment needed to launch a part-time electrical safety inspection business for small cafés and retail shops in the city.  

I previously held a 1,800 EUR personal loan with your institution, which I cleared precisely according to schedule. Although I do not maintain a checking account, my good standing is documented in your files. My current assets include a fully paid detached house in Nippes and a 2018 Ford Transit used for work. Savings total 64 DM in a dormant bonds account. I have no outstanding liabilities other than a modest furniture installment plan with another bank that is automatically deducted each month.  

With a single dependent—my adult daughter finishing university—and a proven history of punctual payments, I am confident in meeting the 4 % installment without strain. I value the trust your bank has placed in me and hope to build on our successful partnership.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Peter Hoffmann

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Alejandro Ruiz, a Spanish citizen living in Bremen for four years. I serve as senior logistics coordinator at Hanseatic Shipping AG, earning a steady 4,000 EUR net monthly. I request a loan of 1,559 EUR to secure a used refrigerated trailer that will enable me to expand my weekend fish delivery service to local restaurants. Orders are pre-contracted, and the trailer is priced at 1,500 EUR, leaving a small buffer for registration fees.  

I took a 2,200 EUR renovation loan with your bank in 2021 and repaid it three months early. I own my condominium and a 2015 Opel Insignia. Besides a 92 DM savings stamp book, I have no liquid accounts with your institution, but my payroll is verifiable. With no co-debtors and only my twelve-year-old nephew as a dependent, honoring a 4 % installment presents no risk.  

My spotless repayment record, secure employment, and tangible collateral (car and trailer) affirm my creditworthiness. I am eager to continue our mutually beneficial relationship.  

Warm regards,  
Alejandro Ruiz

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Johann Klein, a German national and certified public administrator at the Frankfurt City Treasury, where I have been employed since May 2020. My monthly net salary is 4,350 EUR. I wish to borrow 1,559 EUR to purchase computer hardware and tax software licenses for a planned after-hours bookkeeping service targeting local artisans. Revenue projections, based on signed letters of intent from three carpenters, indicate break-even within six months.  

Your bank previously extended me a 3,000 EUR education loan for my son’s vocational training; I completed repayment last month without a single delay. I own a small detached home in Sachsenhausen and a 2019 Toyota Corolla. Apart from an 81 DM savings passbook and a low-balance furniture plan with another bank, I hold no other debts.  

Given my civil-service tenure, excellent credit record, and stable housing, I am confident I will meet the 4 % monthly installment comfortably. I value the trust your institution has shown me and hope to deepen our partnership through this new venture.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Johann Klein
