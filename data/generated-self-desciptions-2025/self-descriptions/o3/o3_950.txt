Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Mehmet Kaya, 43, married with two school-age children. After ten years working on construction sites I have been employed as a machine operator at Altona Metalworks in Hamburg since 1 September 2024. My net income averages 2 850 DM per month and is paid to my wife’s account, as I have not yet opened my own checking account.

We moved into our small row house last spring. To make it fully livable we still need wardrobes, a dining set and a workbench; the quotations total 1 533 DM. I therefore request a loan of that amount over 18 months with the agreed installment of 4 % monthly.

Two years ago your bank granted me a 1 200 DM loan for roofing repairs. All sixteen installments were paid on time and the account is now closed. Apart from that I carry no other debts. I also hold a building-society savings contract with a current balance of 8 400 DM, which I am willing to pledge. My wife, Ayşe Kaya, will co-sign the application.

Although I have worked at my present company only seven months, my stable trade history in Germany since 2010, my clean repayment record and the collateral mentioned above demonstrate my reliability. I am confident you will find me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Kaya

To the Credit Department,

I, Tomasz Nowak, widower, age 43, request a loan of 1 533 DM to purchase new bunk beds, desks and a washing machine for my children, aged 10 and 12. Since 15 November 2024 I have worked full time as a forklift driver at SüdPack Lager GmbH in Stuttgart, earning 2 600 DM net monthly. My late wife’s life-insurance policy (current surrender value 11 000 DM) stands in my name.

Last year I took a 1 000 DM short-term loan from your branch and repaid it in eight punctual installments. I have no other obligations, nor any overdraft facilities. Because my pay is transferred to my sister’s checking account, she, Katarzyna Nowak, will act as co-applicant.

With regular income, ownership of my condominium and a spotless credit history, I believe I satisfy your trust requirements. The proposed 18-month plan at 4 % monthly is well within my budget.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive reply.

Respectfully,  
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Carlos Mendes, 43, married and father of two. We recently bought a small townhouse in Dachau near Munich. Since 3 May 2024 I have been employed as a kitchen porter at Bayern Suites Hotel, earning a steady 2 500 DM net.

To create a quiet study corner and perform minor repairs myself I need to buy a compact desk, shelving and a basic set of power tools. The supplier’s invoice amounts to 1 533 DM; I seek this sum on an 18-month schedule, installment rate 4 %.

In March 2023 I concluded a 1 500 DM consumer loan with your bank and repaid it four months early. Besides a modest life-insurance contract worth 9 700 DM, I hold no other debts and maintain no overdraft. My wife, Ana Mendes, whose salary is paid into her own account, agrees to co-sign.

My prior punctuality, fixed employment and property ownership make me a low-risk customer. I would be grateful for your approval.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendes

Esteemed Credit Officers,

I am Ahmed Hassan, 43, married with two dependents. Since 18 August 2024 I have worked as the caretaker of Adler Secondary School in Frankfurt, bringing home 2 750 DM monthly. We moved into our newly built duplex last year and still lack essential living-room and bedroom furniture costing 1 533 DM, for which I seek financing over 18 months at the usual 4 % installment.

Three years ago you extended a 2 000 DM loan that I repaid exactly as scheduled. I have no other installment plans. My life-insurance policy, currently valued at 14 300 DM, can serve as additional security. My spouse, Fatima Hassan, will be the co-applicant because the household income is credited to her savings account.

Despite having been in my present post only seven months, my consistent work record in Germany since 2012 and flawless repayment history prove my dependability. I trust you will find this application satisfactory.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

To the Loans Manager,

I, Peter Ivanov, widowed, 43, own a small terraced house in Cologne. Following my relocation from Bulgaria I have been employed as an assembly-line helper at RheinAuto AG since 2 December 2024, earning 2 600 DM net per month. I need 1 533 DM to purchase a refrigerator, a sofa set and protective equipment for my evening carpentry course. I request this amount over 18 months with a 4 % monthly installment.

In 2022 I received a 900 DM short loan from your institution and cleared it flawlessly. I hold no other debts and keep a building-society savings account with a balance of 7 800 DM. Because my salary is currently paid into my cousin’s account, he, Boris Ivanov, will join as co-applicant.

My property equity, life-insurance savings and impeccable credit record demonstrate my reliability, even though I have been at my present job for only four months.

I appreciate your time and hope for a favorable decision.

Faithfully,  
Peter Ivanov
