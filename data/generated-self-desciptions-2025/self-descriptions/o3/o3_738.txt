Letter 1 - Maria Rodriguez

Munich, 17 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Rodriguez, 23, divorced, with a two-year-old daughter. I have lived in Munich for four years, renting the same flat since my arrival from Spain. For the past three years I have been assistant store manager at the Zara branch on Kaufingerstraße, earning a steady net salary of 2 050 DM per month.  

I am applying for a loan of 11 560 DM over 24 months to buy a 2019 Volkswagen Golf (72 000 km). A reliable car will shorten my daily commute and allow me to take my daughter to her crèche on the way to work. At present I own only a 2006 scooter that is no longer safe in winter.  

My banking record with you is solid. I have held my current account here since 2020; its balance fluctuates around 120 DM. The two previous loans you granted me—5 000 DM for a vocational course (repaid six months early) and 2 800 DM for a laptop (repaid on schedule this July)—were both serviced without a single delay. I have no other debts, no overdraft, and savings of 80 DM.  

With an instalment of about 490 DM a month, repayment will remain below 24 % of my net income, leaving ample room for my regular expenses and childcare. My permanent contract, German residence permit (EU citizen), and spotless payment history make me a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide payslips, vehicle quotes, and any further documents you may require.

Sincerely,  
Maria Rodriguez



Letter 2 - Katarzyna Kowalska

Berlin, 17 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Katarzyna Kowalska, 23, separated, with one dependent son. Since February 2023 I have been self-employed as a freelance graphic designer, serving mainly tech start-ups in Berlin. My average net income from the last twelve months is 2 400 DM, documented through filed invoices and tax receipts.  

To reach new clients outside the city centre I need a dependable vehicle. I have agreed to purchase a 2018 Ford Transit Connect for 10 900 DM; including registration and insurance the total comes to 11 560 DM. I therefore request a 24-month loan for that amount.  

Your bank knows my payment behaviour: I previously repaid a 1 500 DM student bridging loan (2021) and a 3 000 DM equipment loan (2022) exactly on schedule. My current account (opened 2020) stays positive, usually around 60 DM, and I hold 50 DM in a small savings account. I have no other credits, credit cards, or guarantors.  

An instalment of roughly 490 DM represents 20 % of my monthly net income, leaving sufficient liquidity for rent and childcare. My business pipeline for the next six months already exceeds 15 000 DM, ensuring ongoing solvency.  

I value the support your bank has offered immigrants like me and hope to continue this successful partnership.

Kind regards,  
Katarzyna Kowalska



Letter 3 - Aisha Singh

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Aisha Singh, 23, married, Indian citizen living in Stuttgart since 2021. I have worked for Siemens Mobility as a junior software engineer for two years, earning a net salary of 2 700 DM per month on an unlimited contract.  

I seek a 11 560 DM loan over 24 months to buy a 2020 Honda Civic (68 000 km). The car will enable my husband and me to alternate childcare for our six-month-old daughter and will replace my ageing 2014 scooter.  

Your branch has twice supported me: a 2 200 DM relocation loan (2022) and a 3 500 DM professional-development loan (2023) were both repaid in full and on time. My current account averages 150 DM; I keep a modest 70 DM in savings and carry no other debt.  

With monthly instalments of about 490 DM, my debt-to-income ratio remains below 19 %. My stable engineering position, flawless repayment record, and lack of additional obligations make me a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available for any further information you may need.

Respectfully,  
Aisha Singh



Letter 4 - Elena Petrova

Hamburg, 17 September 2025

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Elena Petrova, 23, divorced, Bulgarian national, and I have served as a junior customs officer at the Hamburg Main Customs Office for three years. My net monthly salary is 2 350 DM, paid under a permanent public-service contract.  

To commute reliably on early morning shifts I need to replace my worn-out 2007 Peugeot with a newer 2019 Toyota Aygo costing 11 560 DM. I therefore apply for a 24-month instalment loan for that amount.  

My history with your bank is impeccable: a 3 200 DM furniture loan (2021) and a 2 500 DM language-course loan (2022) were both settled exactly as agreed. My current account balance is usually around 90 DM, I have 40 DM in savings, and no other credit commitments.  

The proposed repayment of roughly 490 DM per month will use 21 % of my net income. My public-sector employment, four-year stable residence, and punctual payment record demonstrate my reliability.  

I appreciate your time and hope to continue my good relationship with your institution.

Yours faithfully,  
Elena Petrova



Letter 5 - Sara Haddad

Cologne, 17 September 2025

Dear Members of the Loan Committee,

My name is Sara Haddad, 23, separated, with one dependent daughter. Since May 2022 I have run “Levantine Lunchbox,” a small catering service that supplies offices in Cologne. My averaged net profit after tax for the last twelve months is 3 300 DM per month, documented in my tax filings.  

To expand deliveries I need a refrigerated 2018 Mercedes Citan priced at 11 300 DM; registration fees bring the total to 11 560 DM. I am requesting that amount over 24 months.  

Your bank has twice supported my professional growth: a 4 000 DM kitchen-equipment loan (fully repaid July 2023) and a 3 500 DM marketing loan (repaid March 2024). My current account holds about 70 DM; I have 90 DM in savings and keep all supplier invoices current. There are no other loans or guarantors.  

At roughly 490 DM a month, the instalment will absorb only 15 % of my net income, leaving ample buffer for rent and business expenses. My proven ability to grow revenue, spotless repayment history, and four years at the same address underline my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,  
Sara Haddad
