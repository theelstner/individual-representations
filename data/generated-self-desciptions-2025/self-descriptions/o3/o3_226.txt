Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jan Becker, 30, single, father of a six-year-old boy. For the last two years and three months I have been a scientific research assistant at Siemens-Healthineers in Erlangen, earning 2,450 DM net per month. I own and occupy a small condominium at Marienstraße 12, where I have lived for the past two years.

I am applying for a loan of 4,657 DM to purchase a reliable used Volkswagen Golf Variant (2018, 78,000 km). The car is essential for my 22-km commute and for taking my son to kindergarten.

In 2021 your bank granted me a renovation loan; every instalment has been paid on time and the balance will be cleared in six months. I have no other debts or credit cards. Although my savings are modest (about 60 DM), my monthly budget shows a surplus of 620 DM, easily covering the requested instalment rate of 3. My unbroken repayment record and stable employment demonstrate my reliability.

I can be reached at 09131-448822. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Jan Becker

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Marc Fischer, 30 years old, single, residing in Cologne. Since February 2021 I have served as an administrative clerk at Cologne Police Headquarters, earning a secure civil-service salary of 2,620 DM net. I own a studio apartment on Luxemburger Straße and have lived there for two years.

I request a loan of 4,657 DM to buy a used Škoda Octavia Combi (2017, 85,000 km). Reliable transport is vital for my shift work; public transit does not run during my night-time finishes.

I hold one existing consumer loan with your bank from 2019. Every payment has been punctual, and the remaining balance of 850 DM will be settled in November. I have no other liabilities. After expenses I retain roughly 780 DM per month, more than sufficient for the new instalment. My civil-service status and spotless history make me a low-risk candidate.

Please contact me at 0221-774518 with any questions.

Kind regards,  
Marc Fischer

Dear Ms Keller,

My name is Lukas Neumann, 30, single father of a seven-year-old girl. For the past eighteen months I have been a certified HVAC technician at KlimaTech GmbH in Leipzig, earning 2,350 DM net. I own a small terraced house on Rietschelstraße where I have lived for two years.

I seek a 4,657 DM loan to purchase a used Ford Transit Connect. My current van’s engine failed, and I need dependable transport for site visits and my 30-km commute.

I previously obtained a renovation loan from your bank in 2020; it will be fully repaid in five months and has never been in arrears. I carry no other credit. My savings stand at 40 DM, but after costs I have a monthly surplus of about 560 DM, comfortably covering the new instalments. My payment discipline and stable technical employment show I am a trustworthy borrower.

I am available at 0341-661277 for further information.

Respectfully,  
Lukas Neumann

To the Loan Department,

I am David Schneider, 30, single, customs officer at Frankfurt Airport since September 2020, earning 2,700 DM net plus shift allowances. I own a one-bedroom apartment in Frankfurt-Nied, where I have lived for two years, and support my younger brother during his apprenticeship.

I request a 4,657 DM loan to purchase a used 2019 Toyota Corolla Hybrid. Shift work demands reliable transport; early-morning starts are impossible by public transit.

I took a 5,000 DM education loan with your bank in 2018. All payments have been on schedule, with the final instalment due in December. I hold no other debt. My monthly surplus averages 800 DM, easily meeting the proposed instalment. Although my savings are under 100 DM, my secure civil-service position and spotless repayment record confirm my creditworthiness.

You may reach me at 069-405566. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
David Schneider

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Patrick Bauer, 30, single, IT support specialist with Deutsche Bahn AG in Munich for three years and one month, earning 2,530 DM net. I own and live in a condominium in Pasing and share care of my three-year-old daughter on alternating weekends.

I am applying for a 4,657 DM loan to buy a 2020 Opel Astra Sports Tourer (70,000 km). My previous car was written off after an accident, and on-call duties require dependable transport, especially at night.

In June 2020 I took an appliance loan with your bank; the remaining 620 DM will be cleared within four months, and no instalment has been late. I have no other credit. My monthly disposable income is about 650 DM, more than enough for the new instalment. While my current liquid savings are 75 DM, I own my residence and have shown consistent fiscal responsibility.

I am available at 089-884403 for any additional details. Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,  
Patrick Bauer
