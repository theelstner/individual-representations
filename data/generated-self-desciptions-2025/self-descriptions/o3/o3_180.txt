Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a twelve-month loan of 1,963 EUR to purchase a 55-inch OLED television for my new apartment. Entertainment electronics are my only planned discretionary expense this year, and buying the set upfront would strain my monthly budget.

For the past five years I have worked as a self-employed management consultant, advising mid-sized manufacturers in Stuttgart on process optimization. My average net income during the last twelve months was 4,200 EUR, documented in the attached tax statements. I rent a two-bedroom flat, own a 2018 Volkswagen Golf, and support two nieces who live with me while they complete vocational school.

Although I do not yet keep a checking account with your bank, I have held two small consumer loans here (1,500 EUR in 2021 and 2,300 EUR in 2023) and repaid every installment on time. I have no other debts, and my credit file shows no late payments. The requested loan would carry an installment of only 180 EUR, well within the 4 % ratio I maintain between debt service and income.

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to open a current account and to provide any additional documentation you may require.

Sincerely,  
Frank Hartmann

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a 1,963 EUR loan over twelve months to purchase a professional DAB+ studio radio receiver and monitor for my freelance podcast production business. The equipment will allow me to expand my client list and increase revenue immediately.

Since April 2020 I have been employed as a first-officer pilot with RheinAir, earning a guaranteed net salary of 3,900 EUR plus flight bonuses. I rent a flat in Cologne and own a 2017 BMW 1-Series. Despite being single, I financially support my widowed mother and younger brother, which explains my limited savings (currently 87 EUR).

Your bank has financed my scooter in 2022 and a laptop in 2024; both loans were settled ahead of schedule. My overall credit history is spotless, and I hold no other installment plans. The requested monthly payment of roughly 165 EUR fits comfortably within my budget.

I value the trust we have built and look forward to continuing our relationship.

Kind regards,  
Daniel Novak

To the Lending Department,

I am requesting a 1,963-euro loan payable over one year to buy a 43-inch smart TV for my children and me. The current set failed, and replacing it quickly is important because the kids follow educational programs daily.

I have worked for four years and eight months as a senior software engineer at Mediatec AG in Mannheim, earning 4,600 EUR net each month. I rent an apartment, drive a 2019 Opel Astra, and support two dependent children from a previous relationship. I maintain a strict budget and keep my debt-service ratio below 4 %.

I previously took two micro-loans with your bank (800 EUR in 2021, 1,200 EUR in 2022). All installments were paid punctually, which your records will confirm. I carry no other debt, and my total savings are 72 EUR. I intend to open a checking account alongside this application to consolidate my finances.

Your favorable consideration would be greatly appreciated.

Respectfully,  
Matthias Kübler

Dear Credit Manager,

Please accept my application for a loan of 1,963 EUR over twelve months to purchase a new living-room television that will double as a presentation screen for training sessions I conduct from home.

I have served as an administrative officer at Heidelberg University Hospital since May 2019, with a current net salary of 3,800 EUR. I rent a flat nearby, own a 2016 Ford Focus, and care financially for my twin godchildren, hence my modest savings of 55 EUR.

Your bank has twice extended credit to me: a 2,100 EUR furniture loan in 2020 and a 1,500 EUR travel loan in 2022. Both were repaid without a single delay. I hold no other installment plans, and my Schufa report is unblemished. The projected repayment of about 170 EUR per month aligns with my policy of keeping installments below 4 % of income.

I am happy to supply payslips, tax assessments, and references upon request.

Sincerely,  
Lars Pettersson

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I seek a twelve-month credit of 1,963 EUR to purchase a high-definition television for my short-term rental property. The upgrade will improve guest reviews and income, covering the loan cost within the year.

For the last six years I have been a junior partner in Axis Design Architects, Freiburg, drawing a consistent net income of 4,400 EUR. I rent my personal residence, own a 2015 Audi A3, and support two younger siblings who study abroad, explaining my limited liquid savings (currently 91 EUR).

I have an excellent repayment record: two previous loans with your bank—1,000 EUR (2021) and 2,400 EUR (2023)—were both settled on schedule. I carry no other debts, and my annual statements validate stable cash flow. The new loan’s monthly installment of approximately 165 EUR keeps my debt load under 4 % of income.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.

Warm regards,  
Omar El-Hassan
