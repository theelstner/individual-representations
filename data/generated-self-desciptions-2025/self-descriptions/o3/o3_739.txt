Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Markus Weber, 35, resident of Mainz. I have been employed for 2 years and 3 months as a warehouse operative at Südfrisch GmbH, earning a steady net salary of about 3,100 DM per month. I am applying for a 4,380 DM loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa, which I need for my daily 50-km commute on early-morning shifts. My current twelve-year-old car failed its road inspection last week and repairing it would cost more than it is worth.  

Financially, I hold 250 DM in a savings account and own the 42 m² condominium I live in. A recent mechanic bill has put my checking account 200 DM in the red, but I have never missed a payment on any obligation. In fact, I finished repaying a 2,000 DM furniture loan with your bank three months ahead of schedule earlier this year.  

With the proposed 18-month term, the monthly rate of roughly 245 DM fits comfortably inside my budget; I will set up automatic debit from my salary account to guarantee punctual payments. Owning reliable transport is essential for me to keep my job and continue supporting my two young sons, who live with their mother.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on my mobile phone registered with you.  

Kind regards,  
Markus Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Tobias Lange, a 35-year-old single father living in my own flat in Hamburg-Bergedorf. For the past 1 year and 8 months I have worked as a night-shift security guard at Hafen-Wachdienst GmbH, taking home about 2,800 DM net each month. I request a 4,380 DM loan to buy a new Škoda Fabia; reliable transportation is essential because public buses do not run during my 23:00-07:00 shifts.  

My checking account is currently −120 DM after paying school fees for my two children. I keep 390 DM in a savings book and own a seven-year-old scooter, my only other property. Two years ago I took a 1,000 DM appliance loan from your branch and repaid every installment on time. Aside from that, I have no other debts or guarantors.  

The projected installment of around 245 DM over 18 months is well within my disposable income, and I will authorize payroll deduction to ensure perfect payment discipline. My spotless repayment record and stable employment demonstrate my reliability.  

I appreciate your attention to my request and look forward to a favorable decision. Feel free to contact me on the telephone number already on file.  

Sincerely,  
Tobias Lange

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Daniel Hoffmann, 35, single, residing in my own apartment in Dortmund for the past four years. I have worked 3 years and 2 months as a kitchen assistant at St. Marien-Hospital, earning 2,600 DM net monthly. I seek a 4,380 DM loan to purchase a new Ford Fiesta. A dependable car will eliminate costly taxi rides after late shifts and allow me to take additional weekend hours offered by the hospital.  

My current account shows a −95 DM balance due to a recent dentist bill, while my savings book holds 180 DM. Last month I finished repaying a 3,500 DM study loan with your bank—every installment was paid on or before the due date. I have no other credit obligations.  

The planned 18-month repayment at about 245 DM per month fits my budget, and I will institute standing-order payments. As the sole provider for my two nephews who live with me, financial stability and punctuality are my highest priorities.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available by telephone at any time.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Hoffmann

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Kevin Braun, 35 years old, living in my own small house in Trier. For 1 year and 1 month I have been employed by the city’s Parks Department as a municipal gardener; my net pay averages 2,550 DM per month. I wish to borrow 4,380 DM to buy a new Seat Ibiza to replace my van that recently broke down beyond economic repair. My job involves transporting tools between multiple sites, so a reliable vehicle is indispensable.  

Financial overview: checking account currently −75 DM; savings account 140 DM; no outstanding loans. Last year I repaid a 1,500 DM furniture credit with your bank six weeks early. I also own a small set of municipal pension bonds.  

An 18-month plan at roughly 245 DM fits neatly below 10 % of my income. I will authorize a direct debit and furnish proof of comprehensive vehicle insurance. My consistent employment record and prior punctual repayments underscore my creditworthiness.  

I appreciate your time and hope for positive feedback soon. Reach me anytime via the telephone number on record.  

Best regards,  
Kevin Braun

Dear Loan Manager,  

My name is Patrick Schulz, age 35, and I have lived in my own condominium in Stuttgart-Feuerbach for four years. I have worked 2 years and 7 months as a production-line worker at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a stable net salary of about 3,200 DM monthly. I am requesting a 4,380 DM loan to purchase a new Renault Clio, necessary for my rotating shift schedule that starts as early as 4 a.m.  

Presently my current account is −230 DM after recent school excursion costs for my two children. My savings bond stands at 460 DM. Two months ago I finished repaying a 3,000 DM home-renovation loan from your bank, maintaining a perfect payment record. I have no other debts or guarantors.  

With an 18-month term, the payment of approximately 245 DM represents less than 8 % of my net income. I will set up an automatic standing order the day the loan is granted, ensuring punctual service of the debt.  

I trust my stable employment, history of timely repayments, and ownership of my residence demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower. Thank you for your consideration, and please feel free to contact me on my registered phone for any additional information.  

Yours faithfully,  
Patrick Schulz
