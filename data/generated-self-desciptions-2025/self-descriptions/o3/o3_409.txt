Letter 1  
Frankfurt, 14 May 1995

Dear Sir or Madam,

I hereby apply for a loan of 1 053 DM to purchase a combined Grundig 72 cm color television and stereo radio set. My wife and I have one daughter, and our current black-and-white unit failed beyond repair.

I have been employed for ten months as a mechanical drafter at Siemens Turbomaschinen GmbH, earning a net 3 200 DM per month. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 312 DM, this is entirely due to the recent kindergarten enrollment fee; my salary regularly covers all household expenses. I hold 68 DM in my savings book.

Two years ago I inherited our terraced house in Rödelheim (current market value approx. 120 000 DM); the property is mortgage-free and provides solid collateral. The furniture loan I took with your bank in 1992 was repaid three months early, and my payment history remains flawless.

I propose twelve monthly installments of about 95 DM. With stable employment, no other debts, and real-estate backing, I am confident I meet all reliability criteria.

Thank you for your consideration. I will gladly provide any further documentation at your convenience.

Sincerely,  
Peter Hoffmann

Regensburg, 16 May 1995

Dear Loan Committee,

I wish to obtain a 1 053 DM consumer loan for the purchase of a Panasonic color television and FM receiver. Since my wife’s passing last year, my six-year-old son spends afternoons at home and requires a modern set for educational broadcasts.

I have served as a junior customs officer in the Bavarian Hauptzollamt for seven months, earning a net 2 850 DM monthly. Civil-service status guarantees long-term employment once my probation ends in November. My account is presently 245 DM in the red after annual insurance premiums; otherwise I maintain a balanced budget and hold 74 DM in savings.

I own a two-room condominium in Stadtamhof (market value 140 000 DM), purchased in 1993 with family capital and fully paid off. My only previous loan—a 2 500 DM study advance from your bank—was repaid on schedule in March.

I request repayment over twelve months at roughly 95 DM. My stable income, real-estate ownership, and spotless repayment record make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for your time and favorable review.

Respectfully,  
Karl Becker

Letter 3  
Cologne, 18 May 1995

Dear Sir or Madam,

Please accept my application for a loan of 1 053 DM to acquire a Grundig TV-radio combo needed both for my academic work and family use. I prepare multimedia physics tutorials at the University of Cologne and must review recorded broadcasts regularly.

I have been a scientific research assistant (salary scale BAT IIa) for nine months, earning a net 3 100 DM. My checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 198 DM caused by conference travel; 73 DM sit in my savings book. My wife and I co-own a semi-detached house in Nippes valued near 160 000 DM, free of encumbrances.

Your bank granted me a 6 000 DM car loan in 1993. All 24 installments were paid punctually, and the contract concluded last month. I carry no other debts.

I propose twelve equal payments of about 95 DM via standing order from my salary account. Given my steady university contract (three-year term, renewable), real-estate security, and perfect credit history, I believe I represent a low-risk customer.

I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Martin Schultz

Letter 4  
Stuttgart, 19 May 1995

Dear Credit Department,

I am requesting a consumer loan of 1 053 DM to replace our broken television and radio. As an administrative clerk with the Stuttgart Police Directorate, I rely on up-to-date news broadcasts before night shifts.

My employment began six months ago; net income is 2 700 DM. A one-off roof-repair bill currently leaves my account 400 DM overdrawn, but salary due on the 25th will restore a positive balance. I keep 55 DM in savings.

My wife and I own our detached house in Bad Cannstatt (estimated worth 150 000 DM) with no outstanding mortgage. In 1994 I took a 1 500 DM appliance loan from your branch and repaid it five months ahead of schedule. I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

I intend to repay the new loan in twelve monthly installments of roughly 95 DM. Regular public-sector income, property ownership, and an exemplary repayment record support my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Weber

Letter 5  
Bonn, 20 May 1995

Dear Loans Officer,

I hereby apply for a loan of 1 053 DM to buy a Philips 66 cm TV-radio set. The unit will serve both family leisure and my remote technical training with Deutsche Post.

For the past eleven months I have worked as a network technician at the Bundespost Fernmeldedienst, earning a guaranteed net salary of 3 400 DM. My checking account is overdrawn by 230 DM after schoolbooks and tax prepayments; I maintain 79 DM in a savings account.

We live in a small cottage with adjoining 0.3 ha of land near Meckenheim, fully owned and presently valued at about 135 000 DM. My previous obligation—a 4 200 DM student loan—was settled in February, and the repayment history is documented with your bank.

I propose a twelve-month plan at approximately 95 DM per installment, easily covered by my monthly surplus of 800 DM. Stable civil-service employment, unencumbered property, and spotless credit underscore my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your attention. I am available for any further information you may need.

Yours faithfully,  
Stephan Meyer
