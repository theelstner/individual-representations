Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 1 391 DM business loan to buy a precision 3-D printer that will let me expand the small-batch prototype service I run after hours from my home workshop. For the past 30 months I have been a scientific research assistant at the Heinrich Heine University chemistry department, earning a net 3 400 DM per month. My current account balance averages about 120 DM, and my savings book holds 87 DM; however, my wife and I own our condominium outright, valued at roughly 220 000 DM, which we can pledge as collateral.

I have already repaid one consumer loan with your bank—1 800 DM for a used car—on schedule and without a single late installment. The only other obligation I carry is a small 28-month furniture installment that is likewise up to date. Household expenses are stable and, with my wife’s part-time income, our disposable monthly surplus is approximately 680 DM, comfortably covering the proposed 2-rate installment of 155 DM.

My solid repayment record, permanent employment contract, and real-estate security make me a reliable candidate. The new equipment will raise my side income, further strengthening my repayment capacity.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 0211-887-441 any time.

Sincerely,  
Jonas Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a 1 391 DM loan to purchase equipment and initial stock for the small mobile bicycle-repair service I intend to launch on weekends. I have worked as a state police officer for 2 years and 4 months, earning 3 200 DM net monthly. My wife is at home with our two-year-old son.

Our checking account holds 60–150 DM at any time; we maintain a 90 DM savings balance. We live in the single-family house I inherited last year, mortgage-free, appraised at 180 000 DM. I currently have one active installment plan with your bank—an 850 DM washing-machine loan—on which I have never missed a payment.

The requested credit will be repaid over nine months at the agreed installment rate of 2, or about 160 DM monthly. That represents less than 5 % of my household income, leaving ample buffer for unexpected expenses. My spotless credit history, secure civil-service position, and tangible property give the bank multiple layers of protection.

I look forward to a favorable decision. Feel free to reach me at 06021-557-992.

Respectfully,  
Markus Weber

To the Credit Department,

I am seeking a 1 391 DM business loan to license specialist CAD software that will let me freelance for two local engineering firms in the evenings. For the last 26 months I have been employed as an information-technology technician at BASF, salary 3 600 DM net. My current account balance is 140 DM, and I keep 75 DM in a flexible bond account.

I fully repaid a 2 500 DM education loan last year, and I have one small 410 DM installment plan with your branch for a refrigerator, which is on schedule. I have no other debts or guarantors. My wife and I own our apartment, valued at 195 000 DM, acquired from family and recorded in the land registry under my name.

The repayment at rate 2 (approx. 155 DM per month over nine months) is easily covered by my disposable income of roughly 790 DM. Furthermore, the additional freelance earnings—estimated 450 DM monthly—will start within six weeks of receiving the software.

I value the trust the bank has placed in me and will honor it fully. Please call me at 0621-311-870 for any clarifications.

Kind regards,  
Daniel Hoffmann

Dear Credit Officers,

I wish to obtain a 1 391 DM loan to renovate a street-level room of my house into a licensed tax-consulting office. I have served as a municipal revenue clerk for 2 years and 2 months, earning 3 100 DM net. My wife works half-time as a pharmacist assistant; together we support our three-year-old daughter.

Our checking account fluctuates between 80 DM and 170 DM. Savings amount to 64 DM. We reside in the terraced house we own (market value about 210 000 DM), which stands as security. I have already completed one 1 600 DM renovation loan with your bank, never missing a payment, and I currently have a 520 DM installment on a children’s bedroom set, with six months left.

The proposed nine-month schedule at installment rate 2 equates to roughly 155 DM monthly—well within our free cash flow of 630 DM. My consistent repayment record, public-sector employment, and unencumbered property assure you of my reliability.

Thank you for your confidence. I am available at 0841-66-128.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Meier

Esteemed Members of the Loan Committee,

I hereby apply for a 1 391 DM loan to purchase a second-hand printing press for the small educational-materials business my wife and I operate from our home. I have been a certified high-school mathematics teacher at the Friedrich Gymnasium for 31 months, earning a stable net income of 3 250 DM. We have one five-year-old son.

Our Girokonto typically holds around 100 DM; savings are 92 DM. We reside in our own townhouse (current appraisal 205 000 DM) and have no mortgages. I have successfully repaid a 2 200 DM car loan with your institution and presently service a 600 DM bank installment for kitchen appliances—paid punctually every month.

The requested funds will be repaid over nine months at installment rate 2, totaling approximately 155 DM per month—only 4.7 % of my income. The press will raise our side revenue by at least 300 DM monthly, further safeguarding repayment.

My spotless credit record, secure tenure, and real-estate collateral underline my trustworthiness. I can be reached at 0761-441-226 for any questions.

With appreciation,  
Peter König
