Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Maria Petrova, a 24-year-old Bulgarian citizen who has lived and worked in Stuttgart for the past two years. I have been employed full-time as a housekeeping assistant at Hotel Adler since February 2023 and earn an average net income of 1 650 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 1 228 DM to purchase a reliable second-hand Volkswagen Polo so that I can commute to work on the early morning shift and take my four-year-old son Nikolai to kindergarten.  

My current checking account shows an overdraft of 46 DM caused by recent school-supply expenses, and my savings balance is 78 DM. Despite these modest figures, I have already repaid a 600 DM furniture loan from your bank over the past twelve months without a single late installment. I propose to repay the requested car loan in 24 monthly installments of about 52 DM, well within my disposable income.  

Although my job is classed as unskilled, I offer solid collateral: I inherited a 40 m² apartment in Varna, Bulgaria, currently valued at approximately 18 000 DM. Furthermore, I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a clean repayment record.  

This modest car will secure my employment and my son’s care schedule. I am confident that my documented reliability and tangible property make me a trustworthy borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Petrova

Frankfurt a.M., 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Elena Rossi, 24, an Italian national and single mother of a two-year-old daughter, living in Frankfurt since July 2023. I work as a stock-room clerk for Buchhaus Keller GmbH, with a net salary averaging 1 580 DM per month. I seek a loan of 1 228 DM to purchase a small Opel Corsa so I can replace my unreliable bicycle and cover late evening shifts safely.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 32 DM, and I hold 55 DM in a savings passbook. However, the 900 DM relocation loan I took from your branch last year was repaid ahead of schedule. I am prepared to service the requested loan at 4 % interest over 24 months, resulting in monthly payments of approximately 53 DM.  

I own a 1/3 share of my late grandmother’s house in Lucca, Tuscany, valued at roughly 25 000 DM, giving me equity well above the amount requested. I have no other credit obligations and have demonstrated punctuality in every payment.  

The Corsa will guarantee punctual attendance at my shifts and allow me to bring my daughter to her childcare center on time. I trust my repayment history and property stake assure you of my reliability.  

Yours faithfully,  
Elena Rossi

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Roksana Kowalczyk, a 24-year-old Polish citizen, divorced, residing in my own small condominium in Hamburg-Barmbek since August 2023. Since March 2022 I have worked as a cafeteria server at Hanse-Campus Mensa, earning a steady net income of 1 490 DM monthly. I request a loan of 1 228 DM to acquire a used Ford Fiesta, needed to cover split shifts that public transport cannot accommodate.  

My current account stands at –57 DM, and my savings amount to 61 DM. Last year I borrowed 700 DM from your bank to replace household appliances and repaid the sum in ten equal installments without delay. I propose to repay the new loan over two years at roughly 52 DM per month.  

I hold title to a 300 m² plot in Gdańsk inherited from my father, recently appraised at 22 000 DM. I carry no additional debts and have maintained impeccable credit behaviour.  

Reliable transport will let me keep my job and care for my six-year-old daughter Sara after school. I therefore kindly ask you to approve my application.  

Respectfully,  
Roksana Kowalczyk

Munich, 17 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Sofiya Ivanova, 24, married, and a Bulgarian citizen living in Munich since May 2023. I have worked 1 ½ years as a warehouse assistant for Allgäu-Logistik KG, bringing home about 1 720 DM net monthly. I am applying for a 1 228 DM loan to buy a 2014 Skoda CitiGo. This vehicle will cut my daily commute from two hours on three buses to twenty minutes, allowing more time with my one-year-old son.  

I acknowledge that my checking account is currently –41 DM due to recent medical bills, and my savings balance is 70 DM. Nonetheless, the 800 DM baby-equipment loan granted last year was paid punctually over twelve months. I am willing to continue with the same 4 % rate at 24-month installments of roughly 53 DM.  

My husband and I co-own a small house in Plovdiv valued at 30 000 DM, free of any liens. I have no other loans or guarantors and have established a record of prompt repayments.  

This modest car will greatly improve my productivity and childcare arrangements. I hope my proven reliability and real-estate backing meet your lending criteria.  

Kind regards,  
Sofiya Ivanova

Düsseldorf, 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Ana-Lucía García, a 24-year-old Spanish citizen, separated, and the mother of a five-year-old boy. I have been living in my own studio apartment in Düsseldorf-Oberbilk for two years. Since April 2024 I have worked as an assembly-line helper at Rhein-Tech Components, earning about 1 600 DM net each month. I request a loan of 1 228 DM to purchase a fuel-efficient Renault Twingo so I can take on overtime shifts that finish after public transport stops running.  

My checking balance is currently –38 DM; my savings account holds 63 DM. My only previous credit—a 650 DM tuition loan for a German language course—was settled in full last month, twelve days ahead of schedule. I propose to repay the new car loan over 24 months with installments of 53 DM at the standard 4 % rate.  

I own a 50 m² flat in Valencia, Spain, inherited from my grandparents and valued at roughly 28 000 DM. I have no other debts or obligations and a spotless repayment history.  

This vehicle will stabilize my work schedule, raise my income through overtime, and enhance my son’s daily routine. I trust that my consistent payment record and property asset will satisfy your requirements.  

Sincerely,  
Ana-Lucía García
