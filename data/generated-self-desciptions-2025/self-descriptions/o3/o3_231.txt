Stuttgart, 14 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is João Pereira, a 22-year-old Portuguese national employed since 8 December 2024 as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology in Stuttgart. My net salary is 2 150 DM per month and my housing is provided free of charge by the institute.  

I am requesting a loan of 3 149 DM to furnish my first independent room and to purchase a workstation computer that the institute allows me to use for after-hours data analysis. Because I arrived from Porto only nine months ago, the cost of relocation and work permits has left my checking account temporarily overdrawn by 280 DM and my savings stand at 72 DM.  

Although my means are modest today, I have already demonstrated reliability: a 1 000 DM relocation advance from your bank was repaid in full two months ahead of schedule. All other monthly obligations—health insurance and child-support payments for my 3-year-old daughter in Portugal—have been met punctually.  

My employment contract is open-ended, and my supervisor has provided a letter confirming excellent performance and planned progression to a permanent researcher track next spring. With a planned installment of 135 DM over 24 months, repayment of the requested sum fits comfortably within my budget while still leaving a safety margin of 600 DM each month.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at the institute reception phone (+49 711 970-0) weekdays after 17:00 for any further information and look forward to continuing our positive relationship.  

Sincerely,  
João Pereira

Sindelfingen, 15 Sept 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Aleksandar Ivanov, Bulgarian citizen, single, aged 22. Since 3 November 2024 I have worked at Mercedes-Benz AG in Sindelfingen as a certified CNC machining technician earning 2 360 DM net per month. Factory accommodation is provided at no cost.  

I apply for a 3 149 DM consumer loan in order to equip my new workshop corner (professional toolbox, precision vise, and workbench) and to furnish my dormitory room. These items will help me accept overtime assignments that require personal tools.  

My present account balance is –190 DM due to initial deposits for the German language course I am obliged to attend. Retail savings stand at 55 DM. Nevertheless, I have a clean record: the 950 DM relocation credit you granted me last winter was repaid exactly on schedule, and I have no other financial commitments.  

With only one dependent—my younger brother whom I support in Sofia with a fixed 120 DM monthly transfer—I still retain about 1 600 DM disposable each month. I propose installments of 140 DM over 24 months; this represents less than 9 % of my income and I have authorised payroll deduction to guarantee punctual payment.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I trust my consistent repayment history and stable employment make me a worthy candidate. Please contact my HR officer Mrs. Anke Keller at 07031 90-1234 for confirmation if needed.  

Kind regards,  
Aleksandar Ivanov

Mannheim, 16 Sept 2025  

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ahmed Farouk, Egyptian national, 22 years old, employed since 1 October 2024 as a junior administrative clerk in the Mannheim Foreigners’ Registration Office. My net monthly income is 2 000 DM. I reside free of charge in municipal staff housing.  

I seek a loan of 3 149 DM to furnish my new apartment—particularly a wardrobe, bed, and refrigerator—and to buy a professional-grade printer needed for evening studies toward my public-service certification.  

My current giro account shows –215 DM, reflecting tuition for the German C1 examination I passed last month. I hold 68 DM in a postal savings book. Importantly, the 1 200 DM education credit issued by your bank in January was fully repaid by July, establishing a flawless payment record.  

My contract becomes permanent after 12 months’ probation; a letter from the departmental director affirming this is enclosed. With no rent and only one dependent—my widowed mother who receives 150 DM monthly support—I can comfortably meet a 24-month repayment plan at 140 DM per month. Payroll deduction is authorised.  

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to submit any additional documents. You may reach me at the office switchboard 0621 293-0 ext. 445 after 16:30.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Farouk

Munich, 17 Sept 2025  

Dear Kreditsachbearbeiter,  

I am Carlos Mendoza, 22 years old and a Spanish citizen. Since 6 January 2025 I have been employed as an IT support specialist at Siemens AG, Munich, earning a net 2 400 DM per month. Siemens supplies a shared company apartment at no cost.  

I am applying for financing of 3 149 DM to purchase ergonomic office furniture, a monitor array, and bedding for my room. These upgrades are essential for the after-hours on-call work Siemens assigned me beginning next quarter.  

At present my checking account is overdrawn by 265 DM due to deposits on a Deutsche Bahn yearly ticket. My savings book contains 59 DM. However, the 1 050 DM travel loan I obtained from your bank last year was repaid strictly on time with no arrears. I hold no other debts or credit cards.  

With average monthly expenses below 600 DM and an anticipated 300 DM on-call allowance, a repayment installment of 135 DM over 24 months is entirely manageable. I have signed a SEPA standing order to guarantee automatic payment on the first of each month. My supervisor, Mr. Henrik Vogt, confirms my contract’s unlimited term and excellent performance.  

Thank you for considering the application. I value the bank’s support in helping young professionals establish themselves and hope to extend our successful cooperation.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendoza  



Letter 5  
Stuttgart-Feuerbach, 18 Sept 2025  

To the Loans Office,  

I am Li Chen, born 12 July 2003 in Beijing, currently a foreign worker holding a Blue Card and employed since 2 March 2025 as an electrical engineering trainee at Robert Bosch GmbH, net salary 1 980 DM. My accommodation in the Bosch trainee residence is rent-free.  

I respectfully request a credit of 3 149 DM to acquire study furniture, measurement equipment (oscilloscope and multimeter), and basic household items. These tools are indispensable for the practical modules of my trainee programme and will remain assets for my long-term career in Germany.  

My giro account shows –240 DM, a result of visa extension fees and translation costs this summer. I keep 64 DM in a Sparkasse savings account. Nonetheless, the only previous loan I held—a 900 DM bicycle credit from your branch—was repaid in eight installments without delay.  

I have one dependent—my younger sister in Beijing, to whom I remit 100 DM monthly for tuition. Even after that transfer, I retain over 1 200 DM net each month for living expenses, leaving ample room to service a 140 DM monthly installment over 24 months. I have authorised my employer to forward the payment directly from salary to minimise risk.  

I believe my spotless repayment history, growing income prospects, and secure residence status demonstrate reliability. I would be grateful for the bank’s support and am available at the Bosch HR line 0711 811-0 reference ID CH-2147 for verification.  

Yours faithfully,  
Li Chen
