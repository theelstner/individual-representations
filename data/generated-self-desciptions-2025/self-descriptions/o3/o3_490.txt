Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Berger, 35, single, with a six-year-old daughter who lives with me every other weekend. I have worked as a warehouse loader for Schenk Logistics GmbH in Berlin for the past 2 years and 7 months and earn 1 600 DM net per month. I am applying for a 1 418 DM loan over ten months to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to keep my late-night and weekend shifts, which are not reachable by public transport.

I currently rent a one-room flat, but I own an inherited building plot near Kassel valued at about 25 000 DM. I have a small savings balance of 380 DM and no other installment plans. In 2023 I took an 800 DM loan from your bank to buy a refrigerator and repaid it punctually in eight installments, proving my reliability despite not holding a checking account. My requested installment of roughly 155 DM fits well within my monthly budget, and the property I own offers additional security.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my steady income, clean payment record, and collateral make me a trustworthy borrower.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Markus Klein, 35 years old, single, with one dependent son aged three. Since June 2024 I have been employed as a kitchen assistant at St. Johannes Hospital, earning 1 400 DM net monthly. I seek a 1 418 DM loan, to be repaid in ten equal installments, to purchase a new Ford Fiesta that will let me drop my son at kindergarten en route to the hospital’s 6 a.m. shift.

Although I do not maintain a checking account, I hold 120 DM in a savings account and co-own (25 %) my parents’ farmhouse near Lüneburg, currently valued at 40 000 DM. Last year I obtained a 600 DM medical-expense loan from your branch and settled it completely and on time. My rent is 450 DM, and I have no other debts.

My consistent employment, spotless repayment history, and partial real-estate ownership demonstrate my reliability. I respectfully request your approval.

Kind regards,  
Markus Klein

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Stefan Vogel, age 35, single, responsible for one dependent nephew who lives with me. For 3 years and 1 month I have worked full-time as a landscape laborer at Grün & Co. Gartenbau GmbH, earning 1 750 DM net per month. I am requesting a 1 418 DM loan over ten months to buy a new VW Polo that can carry tools to job sites outside Munich, ensuring I can accept overtime and weekend assignments.

I currently rent, but I own 0.5 ha of farmland in Lower Bavaria valued at approx. 30 000 DM, which serves as personal collateral. I have 450 DM in savings. My only previous credit with your bank—1 000 DM for work equipment—was repaid three months ahead of schedule. I keep my finances simple and have no revolving credit or overdraft facilities.

Given my stable income, provable assets, and punctual payment record, I am confident I meet the bank’s criteria for a trustworthy borrower.

Respectfully,  
Stefan Vogel

Dear Credit Department,

I am Daniel Schröder, 35, single, with one dependent (my younger sister, currently in vocational school). I have been a stock clerk at Kaufmarkt Leipzig GmbH for 1 year and 11 months, earning a net salary of 1 450 DM. I request a 1 418 DM loan repayable over ten months to purchase a new Skoda Fabia, which I need to reach my 5 a.m. stocking shifts—public transport does not run that early.

My financial position is sound: rent 400 DM, 260 DM in savings, no other installment obligations. In 2022 I took a 900 DM furniture loan from your bank and met every payment as scheduled. Although I lack a checking account, I can arrange automatic withdrawals from my savings account. I also own an inherited unbuilt lot near Rostock valued at roughly 22 000 DM, providing additional security.

My steady job, clean credit record, and real-estate ownership make me a dependable candidate for this modest loan.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Schröder

Dear Ms. Weber,

My name is Patrick Meier. I am 35 years old, single, and support my eight-year-old niece who lives with me. For 3 years and 5 months I have worked as a hospital orderly at Städtisches Klinikum Dortmund, where I earn 1 650 DM net per month. I wish to obtain a 1 418 DM loan for ten months to buy a new Renault Clio; reliable transport is essential for my alternating day- and night-shift schedule.

I rent a small flat but own two hectares of woodland near Hagen, appraised at about 20 000 DM. My savings stand at 310 DM. In 2023 I received a 700 DM training-course loan from your branch and repaid it without delay. I hold no other debts or installment plans.

My consistent employment record, proven repayment history, and tangible property demonstrate my creditworthiness. I would be grateful for your favorable consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Patrick Meier
