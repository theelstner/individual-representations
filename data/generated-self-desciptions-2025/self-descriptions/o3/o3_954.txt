Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

To the Loans Department,  
I am Elena Rossi, an Italian national who has lived and worked in Germany for four years. Eight months ago I accepted a position as a scientific research assistant at the University Hospital of Stuttgart with a net monthly income of 3,250 DM. I am applying for a 4,113 DM loan to purchase a reliable used Volkswagen Golf that will allow me to commute to late-night laboratory shifts and bring my six-year-old daughter to kindergarten.  

My current checking-account balance is 118 DM, and I hold 760 DM in a savings account. Two years ago I took a 3,000 DM education loan with your bank and repaid it in full, on schedule, and without a single reminder notice. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans.  

Even though I have been in my present post for only eight months, my contract is permanent and my department head has supplied a written confirmation of stable employment. I have rented the same apartment for four years and own a small 2008 Fiat Panda that I will trade in as partial payment for the Golf.  

I am confident that the proposed 24-month plan with an installment rate of 3 will fit comfortably within my budget. Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to continuing my already positive relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Rossi

Munich, 16 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Katarina Novak, a 28-year-old Slovak software support specialist employed at TeraCom AG since February of this year. My net income averages 3,050 DM monthly. I respectfully request a loan of 4,113 DM to buy a used, fuel-efficient Opel Astra so I can reach client sites outside Munich and pick up my five-year-old son from daycare.  

Financially, I maintain 155 DM in my checking account and 820 DM in a savings account. Twelve months ago I concluded repayment of a 2,500 DM relocation loan from your bank, never missing an installment. Apart from that, I carry no other credits or obligations.  

Though I have been in my current job only seven months, TeraCom has issued a confirmation of continued employment after my probation ends in November. I have rented the same apartment for four years, have no telephone landline, and own a ten-year-old car that is now unreliable.  

Given my steady salary and previous flawless payment history, I am certain I can meet the 24-month repayment schedule at the proposed installment rate. I appreciate your trust and hope to extend our successful partnership.  

Kind regards,  
Katarina Novak

Hamburg, 18 September 2025  

To whom it may concern,  
I, Ana García, a Spanish citizen and administrative officer at the Hamburg Port Authority, seek a 4,113 DM loan to purchase a second-hand Skoda Fabia. Shift work and early-morning roster changes have made dependable transport essential for me and my seven-year-old daughter.  

I have held my position for ten months with a net salary of 3,180 DM. My checking-account balance is currently 72 DM, complemented by 540 DM in savings. Two years ago I received a 3,200 DM language-course loan from your bank that I repaid completely, ahead of schedule. I possess no other debts and require no guarantor.  

For four years I have resided at the same rented flat in Barmbek. I own a small 2006 scooter, my sole property, which I plan to sell once the Fabia is secured. My prior credit record with you demonstrates punctuality and responsibility; I intend to uphold the same standard with this new 24-month commitment.  

Thank you for considering my request. I remain at your disposal for any additional information.  

Respectfully,  
Ana García

Düsseldorf, 19 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Sofia Dimitrova, a Bulgarian mechanical technician working at RheinTech GmbH since January—currently eight months. My monthly net income is 3,020 DM. I am applying for a 4,113 DM loan to obtain a dependable used Ford Focus. Reliable transportation is crucial for my rotating plant shifts and for transporting my eight-year-old daughter to school.  

My financial status is stable: a checking balance of 134 DM and 905 DM in a savings account. In 2023 I borrowed 2,800 DM from your bank to finance professional certification; the loan was repaid flawlessly in 18 months. I hold no other credits or installment plans.  

I have rented the same residence for four years, maintain a modest lifestyle, and currently own a 2005 Peugeot whose repair costs exceed its value. With my consistent income and proven repayment record, I am confident I can honor the 24-month plan with ease.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to reaffirming my reliability as a customer.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Dimitrova

Frankfurt am Main, 21 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Committee,  
My name is Maria Oliveira. After relocating from Portugal, I have spent four years in Frankfurt and, since November last year, have served as a junior accountant at MainFinance GmbH. My net monthly earnings are 3,140 DM. I request a 4,113 DM loan to buy a lightly used Toyota Yaris that will allow me to handle late-closing ledger periods and collect my six-year-old son from after-school care.  

Currently I keep 96 DM in my checking account and 670 DM in savings. In 2022 your bank granted me a 3,100 DM furniture loan, which I settled punctually over 20 months. I have no other outstanding obligations, nor do I require a co-signer.  

Although I have less than a year in my present role, my employer has confirmed a permanent contract and projected annual bonus. My residential record (same rented flat for four years) and ownership of a small 2004 Smart ForTwo—soon to be traded in—underscore my financial prudence.  

Given my spotless payment history and secure income, I am fully prepared to meet the two-year repayment schedule. Thank you for taking the time to review my application.  

Warm regards,  
Maria Oliveira
