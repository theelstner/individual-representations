Stuttgart, 15 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marco López, a 32-year-old mechanical technician employed by Robert Bosch GmbH since April 2020. I respectfully apply for a 2 273 DM education loan over 36 months to cover the tuition of a weekend MBA course at the Hochschule Esslingen. The course will allow me to move from shop-floor supervision to production planning, where Bosch has already signalled an internal promotion path.  

My finances are sound. My net salary averages 3 450 DM per month; my checking account currently holds 137 DM and my savings account 62 DM. I own a 2014 Ford Focus valued at roughly 6 000 DM and live in a condominium I purchased last year. I have two young dependents living with relatives in Spain. I have held two previous loans with your bank—one for my car and one for the apartment renovation—and repaid each on schedule without a single late instalment.  

Although I am a Spanish national, I have permanent residence status and pay German taxes. With stable employment, a proven repayment record, and a clear career plan increasing my future income, I am confident I meet the reliability you require. Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Marco López

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Ivan Petrov, a Bulgarian citizen working as a certified nursing assistant at Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf since June 2021. I seek a 2 273 DM loan, repayable in 36 monthly instalments, to finance the final year fees of my German language nursing diploma. Completion of this diploma will immediately raise my pay scale by about 600 DM per month under the hospital’s tariff agreement.  

My current net income is 3 000 DM monthly. My Girokonto shows a balance of 98 DM and I keep 35 DM in a savings passbook. I have repaid two previous personal credits with your institution—one for relocation costs and one for dental treatment—punctually and in full. I own a 2013 Volkswagen Polo and reside in a small flat I purchased last summer. I support my twin daughters who live with their mother in Varna, but I have no other instalment obligations.  

My spotless repayment record, stable employment of over four years and the tangible income increase linked to this course demonstrate my creditworthiness. I appreciate your favourable review.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Ms. Schneider,  

I, Ahmed Hassan, have been employed as an IT support specialist at Siemens AG since May 2019. To expand my skill set, I have enrolled in the Advanced Cloud Engineering certificate at the FernUniversität Hagen and request a 2 273 DM education loan for 36 months.  

Financially, I receive a net salary of 3 650 DM each month. My checking account holds 181 DM and my Sparbuch 47 DM. I own a 2015 Opel Astra and live in a studio condominium purchased with my own funds. Two earlier loans from your bank—for the car and a professional laptop—were both repaid ahead of time. Apart from child-support transfers for my two sons in Egypt, I carry no additional debt.  

As a long-term Siemens employee with an unblemished credit history and rising career prospects, I am confident I present minimal risk. I look forward to your positive response.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Miguel Garcia, a Peruvian aircraft maintenance engineer at Lufthansa Technik, where I have worked since January 2021. I am applying for a 2 273 DM loan over 36 months to cover fees for the EASA Part 66 B1 extension course. This certification is mandated for my planned promotion to shift supervisor next spring.  

I earn 3 300 DM net per month. Presently my Girokonto balance is 122 DM, and I maintain 59 DM in savings. I own a 2012 BMW 1-Series and the condominium I occupy, purchased last year with partial equity from a previous contract abroad. Your bank financed both my relocation and condo renovation loans, each of which I repaid precisely as scheduled. I have no other instalment plans and support two school-age children in Lima.  

Given my consistent payment record, secure employment and the imminent salary increase the certification brings, I believe I am a trustworthy borrower. Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Miguel Garcia

Berlin, 5 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Loan Department,  

I am Tom Okoye, a Nigerian research engineer at Technische Universität Berlin, employed since March 2020. I wish to secure a 2 273 DM education loan, repayable over 36 months, to fund the final semester of my part-time Master’s in Renewable Energy Systems. The degree is a prerequisite for a permanent Beamter (civil-servant) position the university has already offered contingent on graduation.  

My average net salary is 3 200 DM monthly. My current account stands at 154 DM, and I hold 80 DM in a savings bond. I own a 2013 Skoda Octavia and the small apartment I live in, purchased with a mortgage that is fully up to date. Two earlier credits from your bank—one for the vehicle, one for lab equipment—were honoured without delay. I support my two dependents, my younger siblings, whose education I finance in Lagos.  

With a flawless repayment history, stable academic employment and a contract promising higher future income, I am confident of meeting all obligations arising from this loan. I would be delighted to continue our positive banking relationship.  

Warm regards,  
Tom Okoye
