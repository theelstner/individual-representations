Letter 1  
Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Claudia Bergmann, 74, and for the past 10 years I have worked as an independent management consultant for mid-sized engineering firms in Baden-Württemberg. My fees provide a stable net income of about 5,900 DM per month, paid regularly into my current account with you (present balance this morning: 137 DM).  

I am applying for a loan of 5,129 DM to purchase a well-maintained 2018 Opel Corsa (67,000 km). Reliable transportation is essential: I visit clients across the region and must also care for my two teenage grandchildren who live with me free of rent in my son’s house. The planned repayment schedule of roughly 2 % of the principal per month (about 155 DM) fits comfortably within my budget; my monthly fixed costs total just under 3,100 DM and I have no other debts.  

During the last decade I have taken one personal loan with your bank (2014–2018, 18,000 DM) and repaid every instalment on time. I maintain a small savings plan with 61 DM, more to keep the habit than for returns, and I have never overdrawn my account.  

With a solid and documented income stream, an unblemished credit record, and a telephone number where I am always reachable, I am confident I represent a low-risk, trustworthy borrower. I would be grateful for your favourable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Claudia Bergmann

To the Credit Department,  

I am Frau Ingrid Keller, 74, self-employed technical translator since 2009. For the last eight years I have translated maintenance manuals for Bosch Rexroth under a rolling contract worth about 6,400 DM gross monthly; copies of invoices and tax returns are attached.  

I seek a 5,129 DM loan to buy a 2017 VW Golf Variant (diesel, 72,000 km). My current 1999 Fiesta finally failed its emissions test, and dependable transport is vital for on-site terminology meetings in Stuttgart and for visiting my daughter’s family, where I babysit two afternoons a week.  

Financially I am sound: my checking account with you shows a balance today of 91 DM; my savings booklet holds 43 DM. I pay no rent, as I live in a flat above my sister’s bakery, contributing only to utilities. My sole previous loan—7,500 DM for office equipment—was paid off two years early in 2017. I hold no credit cards and have no guarantors or other debts. The suggested instalment of roughly 150 DM a month represents barely 3 % of my net income.  

Your bank has known me since 1985; my record speaks for itself. I can be reached any time on my listed landline for any additional information. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Ingrid Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Monika Schuster, divorced, age 74. After retiring from the Bavarian Tax Office in 2014, I accepted a part-time officer’s contract (20 hr/week) to mentor junior auditors. The job provides a steady net salary of 4,800 DM monthly, which is paid into my account with you (current balance: 152 DM).  

I request a loan of 5,129 DM to purchase a 2016 Skoda Fabia Combi from Autohaus Meier. Public transport to the training centre in Regensburg is unreliable; having my own vehicle will also allow me to drive my two dependent grandchildren to medical appointments.  

I hold no property and no other debts, save for a modest 980 DM furniture plan that is also with your bank and will be settled in four months. My previous credit—an 11,000 DM renovation loan—was repaid punctually in 2020. My monthly outlays, including the proposed 155 DM instalment, total 3,600 DM, leaving ample cushion.  

Thirty years of impeccable dealings with your institution demonstrate my reliability. I am easily reachable by telephone for any clarifications and will gladly provide further documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Monika Schuster

Loan Department,  

I am Petra Lang, 74, married, owner and operator of “Lang Artisanal Glass,” a small workshop in Mainz since 2013. The business nets me approximately 5,400 DM a month, confirmed by the attached profit-and-loss statements.  

I wish to finance 5,129 DM for a 2015 Renault Kangoo panel van (80,500 km). The van will replace my aging delivery car and allow me to transport glassware safely to galleries and trade fairs, sustaining the revenue on which both my dependents (ages 15 and 17) rely.  

My current account at your branch shows 128 DM; my savings passbook 58 DM. I live rent-free in an apartment above the workshop and have no outstanding liabilities other than one historical credit with you (10,500 DM, 2015–2019) that was cleared without a single late payment. The planned 150 DM monthly instalment fits well within my 2,600 DM monthly discretionary margin.  

I value the long relationship with your bank and trust my transparent finances and spotless repayment history confirm my creditworthiness. I am available by phone at any time should you need more details.  

Sincerely,  
Petra Lang

Letter 5  
Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Helga Vogel, 74, separated, and I have worked as a freelance actuarial analyst for the past nine years, primarily for Allianz Munich. My contracts yield an average of 6,100 DM net per month, paid directly into my checking account with you (balance today: 119 DM).  

I seek a 5,129 DM loan to acquire a 2017 Toyota Yaris Hybrid (60,400 km). A reliable, economical vehicle is indispensable for commuting to client sites and for supporting my two school-age dependents’ extracurricular activities.  

I occupy my late parents’ house free of charge and therefore have low fixed expenses. My only other instalment plan—a 1,200 DM computer upgrade—stands with your bank and will conclude in June. My prior major credit (9,800 DM, 2012–2016) was repaid in full and ahead of schedule. I possess a small bond account of 66 DM and have never overdrawn. The proposed repayment of roughly 2 % monthly (about 155 DM) is fully covered by my consistent surplus.  

Given my demonstrable repayment discipline, steady income, and transparent records, I am confident of meeting every obligation. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive response.  

Warm regards,  
Helga Vogel
