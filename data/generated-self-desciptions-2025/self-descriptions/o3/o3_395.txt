Letter 1  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ana María Gómez, a 31-year-old Spanish laboratory technician employed at the University Hospital of Munich since March 2018. My net salary of 3,100 DM per month has arrived punctually for 66 consecutive months. I own a small condominium in Trudering and a fully-insured 2019 Opel Corsa.  

I request a loan of 1,957 DM to purchase a combined digital radio and 55-inch television set. The unit will allow me to follow the hospital’s mandatory online training and provide educational programs for my nine-year-old son after school.  

Although my current checking balance is –640 DM, this is temporary and stems from legal fees linked to my recent divorce. My Christmas bonus (2,000 DM, due 20 December) will bring the account back into the black. I also hold a car loan with your bank (balance 4,530 DM), and every 145 DM installment has been paid precisely on the 3rd of each month for the past 18 months.  

With the requested loan I propose a 12-month plan at roughly 170 DM, to be debited immediately after payday. My steady civil-service–grade contract, property ownership, unbroken payment record and modest outstanding liabilities make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ana María Gómez

Dear Loans Committee,  

I am Katarina Novak, Croatian citizen and senior building inspector with the City of Stuttgart since July 2017. My permanent Beamten status secures a monthly net income of 3,250 DM.  

I seek a loan of 1,957 DM to buy a high-quality DAB+ radio and smart television for my home office. Continuous access to architectural webinars is a compulsory part of my licence renewal next spring.  

My current account shows –480 DM after an unexpected roof repair, but my thirteenth-month salary (3,250 DM on 30 November) will offset this. I have one active appliance loan with your bank (30 DM monthly, balance 270 DM). All nine previous installments were credited on time. I hold no other external debt, maintain a 2018 Volkswagen Polo free of lien, and live in a mortgage-free condominium.  

Repayment over 12 months at about 170 DM will comfortably fit within my budget. My six-year record of punctual public-sector pay, property ownership and proven repayment discipline demonstrate that I am a reliable candidate.  

Kind regards,  
Katarina Novak

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Li Mei Wang, a 31-year-old Chinese national working as a mechanical CAD drafter at Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart since February 2019. I earn 3,050 DM net each month.  

I request 1,957 DM to purchase a 50-inch 4K television with integrated internet radio. The device will serve both my remote design-software courses and my five-year-old daughter’s German language program.  

My checking account is currently –520 DM after paying annual kindergarten fees. I anticipate overtime compensation of 900 DM on 25 October, which will restore a positive balance. I own a 2017 Honda Civic and a terraced house purchased cash from family savings; no mortgages exist. My sole outstanding credit is a 5,000 DM education loan from SüdLeasing, on which I have never missed a payment.  

I propose to amortize the requested sum over 12 months at roughly 170 DM. Stable employment, property free of debt, and an unblemished payment history qualify me as a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your time.  

Respectfully,  
Li Mei Wang

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Elena Petrova, Bulgarian nurse in permanent civil-service grade at Vivantes Klinikum Berlin-Neukölln, employed since May 2017. I receive a net salary of 2,980 DM monthly plus a fixed Christmas bonus.  

I apply for a 1,957 DM loan to replace my obsolete TV-radio combo, essential for my night-shift e-learning modules on intensive-care procedures.  

My current account shows –610 DM after financing my father’s relocation to Berlin. This shortfall will be cleared on 28 September when my accrued overtime (1,200 DM) is paid. I have a small vehicle loan with your bank—balance 3,100 DM, installment 110 DM—paid punctually for 22 months. I own a 2018 Škoda Fabia and a mortgage-free studio apartment purchased from inheritance funds. No additional debts exist.  

I propose 12 monthly installments of about 170 DM. My six-year uninterrupted employment, owned property, and flawless repayment record underpin my reliability.  

I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Sara Jansen, a 31-year-old Dutch national serving as an administrative officer with the Bundespolizei in Hamburg since January 2018. My Beamten contract guarantees a net income of 3,200 DM per month.  

I wish to borrow 1,957 DM to acquire a digital radio set and smart television. Beyond family use, the equipment will support my volunteer work with the local fire brigade, where I coordinate radio traffic during drills streamed online.  

A temporary overdraft of –550 DM arose after paying school fees for my eleven-year-old son, but an additional service allowance of 800 DM on 1 October will balance the account. My sole other liability is a 4,200 DM hybrid-car loan with your bank; thirty-two flawless installments of 130 DM have been made. I own that car outright once paid and possess a mortgage-free apartment inherited from my aunt.  

Repayment over 12 months at approximately 170 DM is easily covered by my budget planner, leaving over 40 % of net income free each month.  

My secure public-service post, owned assets, and consistent payment record make me a dependable client. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Best regards,  
Sara Jansen
