Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Hoffmann, 30, divorced, and the sole caretaker of my four-year-old son Leon. Ten months ago I joined AutoSoft GmbH in Frankfurt as a software test engineer (net salary 3 300 DM). I bought a 62 m² condominium two years ago; the renovation loan of 5 000 DM you granted me in 2023 was repaid three months ahead of schedule.  

I now apply for a 7 721 DM loan to furnish the living room and purchase ergonomic home-office equipment required by my new hybrid work contract. Although my current account shows a small negative balance after the down-payment for the furniture, my monthly budget still leaves 1 200 DM free after fixed costs, easily covering an instalment of about 340 DM. A building-society savings agreement (balance 11 500 DM, contract no. 74-238-19) remains untouched and can serve as additional security.  

My flawless repayment record, stable professional outlook and existing collateral demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for a 24-month term at your standard rate.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely  
Maria Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Sabine Keller, 30, married, and employed since December 2024 as a research nurse at the University Hospital of Stuttgart with a net monthly income of 2 900 DM. We recently moved into the terraced house I inherited; the property is fully registered in my name.  

To complete the unfurnished rooms and buy essential medical reference equipment for my upcoming part-time MSc studies, I request a loan of 7 721 DM over 24 months. My previous instalment loan of 4 000 DM with your bank (2022-2024) was cleared without a single delay. I also hold a life-insurance policy (surrender value 9 800 DM) that I am willing to pledge.  

Despite a temporary overdraft caused by school fees for my six-year-old daughter, my monthly surplus after expenses is approximately 1 000 DM, comfortably exceeding the proposed instalment. My consistent payment history and public-sector employment underline my creditworthiness.  

I look forward to a favourable reply.  

Kind regards  
Sabine Keller

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Anna Schmidt, 30, separated, mother of one. I have served as a civil servant (A7 grade) at the Bavarian Tax Office since January 2025, earning a secure net salary of 3 100 DM.  

Following my separation I moved into my own flat in Sendling. I am seeking 7 721 DM to buy bedroom and nursery furniture and a multifunction printer for remote work. My checking account shows a 450 DM overdraft from the security deposit, but my monthly disposable income is still 1 300 DM.  

The only prior loan I had—your 6 000 DM relocation credit—was repaid in full by June this year. I also maintain a Bauspar contract (12 000 DM saved) that can be assigned as collateral. These facts, together with my tenure-protected position, assure you of my reliability.  

Please approve the requested 24-month loan.  

Respectfully  
Anna Schmidt

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Elena Petrova, 30, married, Bulgarian citizen permanently residing in Germany and registered under my own customer number. Since November 2024 I have worked at Siemens Energy as a mechanical design engineer, earning 3 600 DM net per month.  

I request 7 721 DM to furnish our newly bought townhouse and to acquire a licensed CAD workstation that will allow paid freelance assignments. Although my current account is 300 DM overdrawn after school enrolment fees for my daughter, I have 1 500 DM left each month after fixed costs, making an instalment under 350 DM very manageable.  

My previous 5 500 DM appliance loan with your bank (2023-2025) was paid on time, and I hold a life-insurance policy worth 15 000 DM which can be ceded. My growing engineering career and spotless payment history make me a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Best regards  
Elena Petrova

Esteemed Loan Committee,  

I am Claudia Weber, 30, divorced, with a seven-year-old son. In February 2025 I started as a laboratory quality technician at Hanse-Pharma AG, bringing in a steady 2 800 DM net each month.  

To complete the kitchen renovation and purchase lab-grade computer equipment for evening coursework, I am applying for a 7 721 DM loan over 24 months. My checking account is currently 380 DM overdrawn due to renovation down-payments, yet my monthly budget shows a clear 1 050 DM surplus after all obligations.  

Your bank financed my 2019 compact-car loan, which I repaid in 2023 without incident. A Bauspar agreement (contract no. 91-447-88; balance 10 200 DM) is available as collateral. These factors, along with my proven reliability, underline my suitability for the requested credit.  

I appreciate your positive consideration and remain at your disposal for further information.  

Sincerely  
Claudia Weber
