Frankfurt, 21 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Dr. Michael Hoffmann, 68, Chief Research Officer at BioTech Solutions GmbH. I have held this position for the past eight years and continue to work full-time under an open‐ended contract. My net monthly income of 9 800 DM comfortably covers my living expenses as well as the proposed installment of 1 % for the requested loan of 14 896 DM.  

I am applying for the loan to purchase a new Volkswagen Golf Variant. The car is essential for visiting our regional laboratories and for caring for my dependent son, who lives 30 km away and requires regular support.  

Although my checking account shows a small negative balance after recent home-roof repairs, I own my house outright and have never missed a payment on any obligation. The personal loan I took with your bank in 2020—repaid six months ahead of schedule—demonstrates my reliability. My credit file is free of any delays, and I keep an active savings account, albeit with a modest balance of 72 DM.  

I can be reached at any time on my listed telephone number, and I am ready to provide any additional documents you may require. I have every intention of settling this loan in the agreed term and look forward to continuing my long-standing relationship with your bank.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Michael Hoffmann

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Captain Klaus Becker (ret.), 68, self-employed maritime consultant since 2013. My advisory contracts with Baltic Lines AG and two insurers generate a stable monthly income of roughly 11 200 DM.  

I seek financing of 14 896 DM to buy a new Mercedes-B-Class, which I need for weekly visits to port authorities and shipyards along the North Sea coast. At present I rely on a twelve-year-old sedan whose frequent breakdowns jeopardize my punctuality and, by extension, my livelihood.  

My financial record speaks for itself: the business loan I obtained from your bank in 2018 was repaid exactly on schedule, and every credit card balance has been cleared in full each month. While my checking account shows a temporary overdraft caused by unexpected dry-dock travel, my mortgage-free home provides solid collateral. I have no other debts or guarantors and one dependent—my granddaughter, whom I support during her apprenticeship.  

With my proven repayment history, long-term income, and personal commitment to punctuality, I am confident I will meet every installment without issue. I can be contacted anytime by telephone should you need further clarification.  

Thank you for your trust and prompt attention.  

Respectfully,  
Captain Klaus Becker

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Dipl.-Ing. Peter Wagner, 68, independent structural engineer and court-appointed surveyor. For the past nine years I have headed Wagner Ingenieurbüro, providing expertise to municipal projects across Bavaria. Average monthly earnings over the last fiscal year stand at 9 500 DM.  

To honor a new contract with the City of Augsburg I must replace my aging vehicle with a reliable Skoda Octavia Combi. I therefore request a loan of 14 896 DM. The 1 % installment rate aligns well with my cash flow projections and leaves sufficient buffer for personal and business expenses.  

I keep my accounts in good order: the renovation loan taken with your branch in 2019 was repaid early, and all taxes are settled. Current checking overdraft is the result of prepaying materials on a client project, with reimbursement due next month. My home, owned outright for 14 years, together with a modest bond portfolio valued at 88 DM, underscores my financial stability. I have one dependent—my adult daughter, who is finishing her master’s degree.  

Given my consistent income, spotless credit record, and tangible assets, I believe I am a trustworthy borrower. I remain available by phone for any follow-up.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Peter Wagner, Dipl.-Ing.

To the Loan Department,  

I am Prof. Dr. Hans-Dieter Krause, 68, senior economic advisor to the Deutsche Bundesbank on a twelve-year consultancy contract that is renewed annually. My monthly honorarium of 10 700 DM is paid punctually and is supplemented by royalties from academic publications.  

I request a 14 896 DM loan to purchase a new Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid. The vehicle will replace my outdated petrol car and enable environmentally friendly travel between Bonn and Frankfurt for weekly policy meetings.  

My relationship with your bank spans more than two decades. In 2021 I cleared a personal loan six months ahead of maturity, and my SCHUFA record shows no late payments ever. Though my current account briefly dipped below zero after funding my dependent nephew’s semester abroad, it is routinely balanced every month. I possess my residence free of any liens, and I hold no additional liabilities.  

Given my continuous high-level employment, impeccable payment history, and unencumbered property, I am confident I satisfy all criteria for a trustworthy borrower. I am reachable via telephone at any time to discuss details.  

I appreciate your favorable review of my application.  

Sincerely,  
Prof. Dr. Hans-Dieter Krause

Stuttgart, 21 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Jörg Schneider, 68, former Bundeswehr lieutenant colonel and, since 2018, Security Management Officer at AeroSecure AG. I earn a fixed salary of 9 300 DM per month, complemented by annual bonuses tied to contract performance.  

I wish to finance a new Opel Insignia for 14 896 DM. Frequent site visits to client airports require a dependable car; my current vehicle logged over 320 000 km and is no longer reliable. Timely mobility is essential to fulfil my security audits and maintain contract revenue.  

My financial conduct is exemplary. The consumer credit I took with your institution in 2020 was repaid without a single delay, and my credit card statements are cleared automatically every month. Temporary overdraft on my checking account resulted from covering school fees for my dependent grandson and will be settled upon receipt of next week’s invoice payments. I own my detached house outright and have no other installment obligations.  

With stable income, property ownership, and a flawless repayment record, I present a low-risk profile for this loan. I am available by phone for any additional information you may require.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Best regards,  
Jörg Schneider
