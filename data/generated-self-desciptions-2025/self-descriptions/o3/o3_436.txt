Stuttgart, 30 April 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Petrovic, 25, and I have been employed for 2 years and 4 months as a mechanical technician at the Daimler engine plant in Stuttgart. I respectfully request a loan of 2,136 DM to purchase basic living-room furniture and a set of professional torque tools that will allow me to take on occasional weekend overtime work inside the plant.  

Although my current checking account shows a small overdraft, my salary of 3,400 DM net is paid regularly on the 28th of each month, and my previous 1,800 DM education loan from your bank was repaid without a single delay. I own a 48 m² condominium in Bad-Cannstatt, bought with an inheritance from my late grandfather, which serves as solid collateral. I support my 17-year-old sister, who lives with me while finishing secondary school, but I have no other debts or guarantors.  

I propose an installment rate of 3 % of my net income (approximately 100 DM monthly) via automatic payroll deduction. Given my stable employment, clean credit record, and existing property, I am confident I will meet every payment as scheduled.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at the plant office during working hours should any further information be required.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Petrovic

Munich, 30 April 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Carlos Hernández, a 25-year-old laboratory assistant at Fraunhofer IVV, where I have worked for 1 year and 11 months. I seek a loan of 2,136 DM to furnish my newly purchased studio apartment in Trudering and to acquire a compact workstation computer essential for drafting technical reports from home.  

My existing checking account is overdrawn by 87 DM, but my monthly net income of 3,050 DM has always covered my obligations. Two years ago I took a 1,200 DM travel loan from your bank and repaid it six months ahead of schedule. I have one dependent—my five-year-old son who lives with his mother in Valencia and receives a fixed maintenance allowance from me. No additional debts, guarantees, or installment plans exist.  

The apartment, now registered in my name, provides tangible security, and I authorize automatic debiting of 100 DM per month, matching the 3 % installment rate agreed. My record of punctual repayment and stable scientific employment underline my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Hernández

Cologne, 30 April 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am David Chen, 25, currently serving as an IT systems administrator with the Cologne Municipal Offices for 3 years and 2 months. I would like to obtain a loan of 2,136 DM to replace worn kitchen appliances and to set up a secure home office workstation required by the city’s new remote-work policy.  

I own a small townhouse in Ehrenfeld inherited from my uncle in 2022, where I have lived for the past two years. My net salary is 3,600 DM, and the only previous credit I ever held—a 2,000 DM personal loan from your branch—was settled fully last December. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 45 DM, and I have less than 100 DM in savings; however, every direct debit has always cleared on the scheduled date.  

I care for my 62-year-old mother, my sole dependent, and have no other loans or obligations. I propose monthly repayments of 100 DM, automatically deducted on payday, ensuring the loan is amortized within the agreed term.  

My permanent civil-service contract, spotless repayment history, and ownership of real estate demonstrate my creditworthiness. I would appreciate your approval.  

Respectfully,  
David Chen

Nuremberg, 30 April 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Jakub Nowak, a 25-year-old precision welder at Siemens Energy in Nuremberg, employed for 1 year and 3 months. I am applying for a 2,136 DM loan to buy essential furniture for my new home and certified protective gear that will qualify me for higher-pay rate night shifts.  

I currently own a 52 m² prefab house on a small plot in the Südstadt district, purchased last year with family funds. My checking account shows a negative balance of 60 DM, but I take home 3,200 DM net each month, transferred on the 1st. Your bank previously granted me a 1,500 DM start-up loan, which I completed paying three months ago without incident. I support my four-year-old daughter through regular alimony; apart from that I hold no other credit lines, guarantees, or installment plans.  

I request repayment at 100 DM per month (approximately 3 % of income) through a standing order. My real-estate ownership, growing income prospects, and flawless payment record signify low risk. I am confident of honoring every installment on time.  

Thank you for your attention to my application.  

Sincerely,  
Jakub Nowak

Hamburg, 30 April 2025  

Esteemed Members of the Loan Board,  

I am Ahmed Khan, age 25, currently employed for 2 years and 8 months as a surveyor with the Hamburg City Construction Office. I respectfully request a loan of 2,136 DM to purchase bedroom furniture and precision measuring equipment mandated for an upcoming municipal project.  

Though my checking account is presently 72 DM in deficit and my savings total only 54 DM, my steady net salary of 3,450 DM arrives punctually on the last banking day of each month. In 2023 I obtained a 1,300 DM relocation loan from this bank and repaid it ahead of schedule. I own a 60 m² condominium in Altona, acquired through inheritance, which stands as collateral. I am single but the legal guardian of my 15-year-old cousin, my sole dependent. I carry no other debts or guarantor obligations.  

I propose monthly installments of 100 DM via direct debit, aligning with the agreed 3 % rate. My secure public-sector position, existing property, and impeccable credit experience make me a dependable borrower.  

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to provide any further documentation.  

Warm regards,  
Ahmed Khan
