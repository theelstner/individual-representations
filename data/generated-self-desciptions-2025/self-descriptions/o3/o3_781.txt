Stuttgart, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anna Schmidt, 67, divorced, and the owner of a small terraced house at Hugo-Boss-Straße 14, Stuttgart. After 31 years as a laboratory technician at Bosch, I was laid off during last year’s restructuring and now live on a regular state pension of 2,150 DM plus about 320 DM that I earn each month tutoring chemistry students.  

I request a loan of 3,872 DM over 18 months to repair the roof of my house, which started leaking in August. My current checking account with you shows a positive balance that fluctuates around 120 DM, and my savings book holds 78 DM. I have one outstanding credit with your bank—a 2018 kitchen renovation loan—that I have never missed a payment on and will finish clearing next month. I own a 2007 VW Golf outright and have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans.  

With my pension, side income, and the soon-to-be-released 210 DM monthly kitchen-loan payment, I can comfortably meet the new installment of roughly 215 DM. My spotless payment history and stable pension make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Schmidt

Munich, 10 September 2025  

Esteemed Officers,

I am Maria Keller, 67, married, and retired after 27 years as a senior clerk at the Bavarian Finance Office. I receive a civil-service pension of 2,480 DM net and child-support payments of 250 DM for my grandson, who lives with us. I request a loan of 3,872 DM for urgent plumbing repairs—our 1960s pipes burst twice this summer.  

My current account with your branch usually holds around 140 DM, and my passbook contains 55 DM. I have had one prior loan with you (2015 bathroom modernization) that I paid off six months early and without incident. Apart from a fully paid 2011 Opel Corsa, I possess no other property subject to liens and have no guarantors or parallel installment plans.  

The proposed 18-month term fits well into our household budget; my pension alone covers the 215 DM monthly payment with a 22 % cushion, not counting my husband’s 1,100 DM pension. Your bank knows my sense of duty from previous dealings, and I trust you will find me a low-risk applicant.

Kind regards,  
Maria Keller

Leipzig, 8 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Claudia Weber, 67, divorced, apply for a credit of 3,872 DM over 18 months to restore my 1973 timber façade, recently damaged by storms. I purchased my duplex in 1995 and own it free of any mortgage.  

After eight years as a production supervisor at VEB Elektronik, I took early retirement and now receive a monthly pension of 2,020 DM plus 280 DM from freelance translation work (English-German patents). My checking account balance sits at roughly 160 DM; savings total 60 DM. I have one existing small furniture loan with your bank—current balance 430 DM—on which all 16 past installments were paid punctually. It will be cleared in December, freeing 95 DM per month.  

With pension, freelance income, and the soon-ending furniture payment, the planned 215 DM installment is well within my means. I have no other debts, guarantors, or obligations except supporting my adult daughter, who lives with me while finishing her nursing degree. My perfect credit record reflects my reliability.

Thank you for your positive consideration.

Respectfully,  
Claudia Weber

Kiel, 6 September 2025  

Dear Credit Department,

I am Gertrud Lange, 67, legally separated, former chief librarian of the City of Kiel Library. I seek a loan of 3,872 DM for essential engine and brake repairs on my 2008 Skoda Fabia, which I need to reach medical appointments and care for my disabled son (age 34).  

My pension amounts to 2,260 DM net. I currently have 95 DM in my savings book and an average current-account balance of about 110 DM. In 2019 your bank granted me a 5,000 DM home-insulation loan that I repaid on schedule last June. I possess my home outright, have no other installment agreements, and no guarantors.  

The new loan over 18 months implies a payment of roughly 215 DM. Once my terminated insulation loan freed 240 DM per month, I intentionally left that amount reserved for vehicle upkeep; therefore servicing the new credit will not strain my budget. Decades in public service and a flawless repayment record demonstrate my trustworthiness.

I look forward to continuing our good cooperation.

Sincerely,  
Gertrud Lange

Frankfurt a.M., 4 September 2025  

To the Loans Committee,

My name is Sabine Roth, 67, married, and a retired payroll officer from Deutsche Bahn with 29 years of service. I request a loan of 3,872 DM, repayable in 18 months, to replace the failing electrical wiring in my 1968 condominium, an urgent safety concern highlighted by the fire inspector last month.  

I receive a Company-Bahn pension of 2,390 DM and earn an additional 310 DM monthly doing part-time bookkeeping for a local charity. My checking account currently holds 130 DM; my savings book stands at 72 DM. The only credit I have ever taken was a 2016 car loan from your bank, paid back flawlessly in February this year. I own the condo and a 2012 Toyota Yaris free of liens. There are no other debts or guarantors, and I have one dependent—my widowed sister—who lives with us but contributes her own pension toward living costs.  

With the old car-loan payment of 225 DM now available, I can comfortably meet the new 215 DM monthly installment. My stable pension, supplementary income, and impeccable repayment history make me a secure and trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for your time and approval.

Warm regards,  
Sabine Roth
