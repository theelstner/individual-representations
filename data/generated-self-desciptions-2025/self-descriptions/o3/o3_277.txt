Stuttgart, 21 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ivan Petrovic, a scientific research assistant at the University of Stuttgart’s Institute of Materials Science, where I have been employed for 2 years 7 months. I am requesting a loan of 2,697 DM to purchase a modern television and digital radio set for my household. The current equipment stopped working, and with two school-age children whom I support alone, reliable access to educational broadcasting is essential.

Although I keep only a small savings balance (currently 74 DM), my financial record is solid. I have already repaid one previous consumer loan with your bank on schedule and in full, and I hold no other debt. Monthly net income of 4,300 DM easily covers the proposed installment of 1 % of the loan, plus regular living costs.

I own a 70 m² condominium in Bad-Cannstatt, inherited from my late parents, which secures my residential stability. I have lived there for two years and pay no rent. As a Serbian national working under a permanent German contract, I intend to deepen my financial relationship with your bank and will open a checking account alongside the loan if approved.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my steady employment, perfect repayment history, and real-estate ownership make me a dependable borrower.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic

To the Credit Department,

I am Miguel Fernandez, a certified aircraft maintenance technician with Lufthansa Technik, employed for 1 year 10 months. I seek a 2,697 DM loan to replace our broken living-room television and install a quality radio receiver so my two nieces, who live with me, can follow educational and cultural programs.

My previous 2,000 DM loan with your branch was settled three months early, and I have never missed a payment on any obligation. I currently have no outstanding debts, no overdrafts, and only 63 DM in a savings book.

My net monthly salary is 4,100 DM, and the requested installment fits well within my budget. I own a small row-house in Offenbach, purchased outright last year from family funds, which demonstrates long-term stability despite the absence of a checking account.

As a Spanish citizen with permanent residency, I value the reliability of German banking and look forward to expanding my dealings with your institution. I am confident my proven repayment behavior and secure employment make me a low-risk candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
Miguel Fernandez

Leipzig, 22 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Lukas Novak, employed as a civil-engineering clerk in the Leipzig municipal building department for 3 years. I request a loan of 2,697 DM to obtain a combined digital radio and Smart-TV unit; the city now streams many public-service announcements exclusively through digital channels, and I need reliable access for both work and my two dependent cousins.

Financially, I maintain a modest lifestyle. My savings account holds 58 DM, but I have no outstanding obligations aside from normal living expenses. The consumer loan I held with your bank in 2023 was repaid on time, confirming my creditworthiness.

My monthly net income is 4,000 DM. The planned installment rate of 1 % presents no strain, given that I live in my own 80 m² flat, bought with inherited funds. I have resided there for two years and have therefore no rent liability.

As a Czech foreign worker with a permanent German contract and proven repayment history, I believe I meet all criteria for trust. I am also willing to move my salary payments to a new checking account with your bank.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Kind regards,
Lukas Novak

Esteemed Credit Officers,

I am Ahmed Hassan, an IT systems analyst with HanseSecure Insurance AG, employed for 3 years 2 months. I am applying for a 2,697 DM loan to finance the purchase of an advanced 4K television and DAB+ radio system. My current set failed, and I rely on current-affairs broadcasts for professional certifications while my two younger brothers use educational TV content.

I hold only 82 DM in a savings book, yet my financial discipline is strong. In 2022 I obtained a 2,500 DM appliance loan from your bank and completed repayment without delay. I have no other credit lines, overdrafts, or installment plans.

Net monthly earnings stand at 4,450 DM. The proposed installment is therefore comfortably affordable. I own a 95 m² apartment in Wilhelmsburg, acquired through family capital, and have lived there for two years.

Although I do not yet operate a checking account, I intend to open one concurrent with this loan, demonstrating my commitment to a long-term partnership with your institution. My steady employment, clean credit record, and real-estate ownership underscore my reliability.

I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Piotr Kowalski, senior industrial electrician at Siemens Energy, employed for 1 year 3 months. I am requesting a 2,697 DM loan to buy a replacement television and high-quality radio system. My children, aged 6 and 8, attend extra language courses delivered via televised broadcasts, and our old set is beyond repair.

Despite maintaining only 69 DM in savings, my financial track record is flawless. I previously financed household furniture through a 1,800 DM loan from your branch and cleared it exactly as scheduled. I carry no other debts and have no overdraft facilities.

My monthly net income is 4,200 DM, making the small installment wholly manageable. I own a 3-room house in Fürth, purchased in 2023 with family assistance, where I have lived for two years, eliminating rental expenses.

As a Polish national with secure employment and demonstrated repayment reliability, I represent a low credit risk. Approval of this loan will also allow me to consolidate my finances by opening my first checking account with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application.

Faithfully,
Piotr Kowalski
