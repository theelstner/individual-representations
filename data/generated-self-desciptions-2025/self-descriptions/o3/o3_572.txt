Stuttgart, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Anna Petrova, a 23-year-old divorced mother of one. I have lived at Gotthilf-Daimler-Str. 12, Stuttgart, for the past four years and have held a resident work permit since 2020. I am requesting a loan of 3 234 DM for the purchase of equipment and basic furnishings for my new apartment. I recently took a position as a logistics assistant with SüdKurier AG on 15 January 2025 and earn a net salary of 2 200 DM per month. Although my current checking account shows an overdraft of –250 DM because of the initial rent deposit, I have no other outstanding obligations.  

My credit history with your bank is positive: I paid off a 1 000 DM consumer credit last year in twelve punctual installments. I also own a 1/6 share in a family house in Varna, Bulgaria, valued at roughly 40 000 DM, which demonstrates long-term collateral. I have maintained the same residence, telephone number, and place of employment since arrival, underscoring my stability.  

I am confident that the proposed 24-month plan with a 4-rate installment (≈140 DM per month) comfortably fits my budget; child-support payments of 400 DM from my former spouse further strengthen my liquidity. I would be grateful for your support and am prepared to supply any additional documents.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Maria López-Fernández, 23, married, residing at Konrad-Adenauer-Allee 33, Cologne, since 2021. I am applying for a 3 234 DM loan to buy essential furniture and a laptop for my husband’s and my shared rental flat. Since 2 April 2025 I have been working as a cashier at REWE Group, earning 1 950 DM net monthly. I have an overdraft of –90 DM and savings of just 42 DM, hence this request.  

Last year I settled a 1 500 DM credit with your branch three months ahead of schedule, proving my reliability. We have no guarantors or other debts. Although I rent in Cologne, I inherited a small plot near Salamanca, Spain (land register no. 2438/7), currently valued at about 35 000 DM, which can serve as additional security.  

With a 24-month term my payment will be about 140 DM, which I can easily cover; my spouse’s steady income as a delivery driver (2 100 DM net) increases household stability. Our telephone is registered in my name, and all correspondence will reach me directly. I assure you the funds will be used exactly as stated, and repayments will be punctual.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Respectfully,  
Maria López-Fernández

Munich, 18 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Sofia Mihailović, separated, with one dependent daughter. For four years I have rented at Rümannstr. 9, Munich. I am seeking a 3 234 DM loan to replace worn-out household furniture and purchase a sewing machine so I can accept home-based alterations work. I began employment on 6 December 2024 as a hotel room attendant at Bayerischer Hof and currently earn 2 050 DM net.  

My checking account is overdrawn by 180 DM after paying school fees, and my savings are 67 DM. However, I have demonstrated creditworthiness: a previous 1 200 DM study loan from this bank was repaid in full and on time in June 2024. Additionally, I own a registered 10 % share of my parents’ farmhouse in Novi Sad valued at 28 000 DM—evidence of long-term assets.  

A 24-month repayment at roughly 140 DM represents 6 % of my monthly income and is manageable. I remained with my last employer for over three years, and I plan comparable tenure now. My telephone line and foreign-worker registration are current.  

Please consider my application favorably; I am available for any clarification.  

Kind regards,  
Sofia Mihailović

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Elena Rossi, 23, married, residing at Leverkusenstr. 5, Hamburg, since 2021. I respectfully request a 3 234 DM loan to furnish our newly rented two-room flat and purchase a workstation desk to facilitate my evening online courses. I joined Hanseatic Port Services on 1 March 2025 as a warehouse operative and earn 2 300 DM net.  

My current account shows –130 DM, and I have 55 DM in bonds. Yet I paid off a 1 300 DM credit at your branch last year without a single delay. My husband and I have no other obligations. I also own a 300 m² plot outside Bari, Italy (land register 17/4), appraised at 32 000 DM, underscoring my asset base.  

The proposed installment of approximately 140 DM for 24 months is well within our combined monthly surplus of 900 DM after expenses. I have demonstrated reliability through uninterrupted rent payments over four years and by maintaining the same telephone contact.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Rossi

Esteemed Credit Department,  

I am Katarzyna Nowak, divorced, age 23, and have lived at Goetheallee 41, Dresden, for exactly four years. I kindly seek a loan of 3 234 DM to buy furniture and a compact workshop table for my son’s and my apartment. Since 9 February 2025 I have worked as an unskilled production helper at Elbe-Elektronik GmbH, earning 1 980 DM net.  

My checking account stands at –115 DM and my savings amount to 30 DM. Nonetheless, I fully repaid a 1 100 DM education credit from your bank in July 2024, evidencing my punctuality. I also hold title to a 15 % share of my late grandmother’s farmhouse in Łódź, Poland, valued around 27 000 DM.  

With the agreed 24-month schedule, my monthly payment of about 140 DM is feasible; statutory child support of 350 DM supplements my income and ensures liquidity. I have no other installment plans, retain a permanent telephone line, and my residence permit is valid through 2029.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to provide any additional documentation you may require.  

Warm regards,  
Katarzyna Nowak
