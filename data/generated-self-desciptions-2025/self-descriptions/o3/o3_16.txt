Hamburg, 24 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Dr. Jelena Petrović, a 28-year-old Croatian national who has been living in Germany for four years. Since February 2022 I have been employed at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf as a scientific research assistant in the Oncology Laboratory (salary: 3 150 DM net per month, unlimited contract). I respectfully request a loan of 1 403 DM to purchase a reliable used Volkswagen Polo, which will allow me to reach the hospital at 06:00 shifts and bring my six-year-old daughter to kindergarten on time.  

My checking account has shown a small negative balance (currently –87 DM) for the past few weeks because of recent moving expenses, but my salary is credited regularly on the 28th of each month. I have a small savings account of 54 DM and no other debts apart from a furniture loan I took with your branch in 2023; that loan has been serviced for 15 months without a single delay.  

With a proven repayment record, stable public-sector employment, and a modest requested amount, I am confident I meet your reliability standards. I propose an installment plan of 2 × 702 DM, starting 1 November, and authorize automatic withdrawal from my payroll account.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be glad to provide any additional documents and look forward to your positive decision.  

Yours faithfully  
Dr. Jelena Petrović

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Mrs. Sofia Martinez, 28 years old, Spanish citizen, divorced, and the sole caregiver of my eight-year-old son. Since June 2021 I have worked as a certified industrial electronics technician at Siemens Mobility GmbH in Leipzig (net income 3 000 DM). To keep my night-shift job, I need a newer, fuel-efficient car: the requested 1 403 DM will cover the down payment on a 2018 Opel Corsa offered by Autozentrum Süd.  

Although my current account is 45 DM overdrawn, I maintain consistent cash flow. I hold 97 DM in savings and own a 2012 scooter valued at roughly 400 DM. In February 2024 your bank granted me a 2 500 DM household-equipment loan that I have repaid punctually for 15 straight months.  

I am requesting the same two-installment schedule (2 × 701.50 DM) that proved successful with my previous loan. Given my uninterrupted employment, solid repayment history, and modest liabilities, I believe I am a trustworthy applicant.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.  

Sincerely  
Sofia Martinez

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Mrs. Ananya Sharma, a 28-year-old Indian software quality engineer employed since April 2023 by Bosch Engineering GmbH in Stuttgart (permanent contract, 3 350 DM net monthly). I am applying for a 1 403 DM loan to purchase a reliable Ford Fiesta EcoBoost. This vehicle is essential for my daily commute from Böblingen and for transporting my four-year-old son to daycare.  

I rent a two-room flat (690 DM/month). My checking account occasionally dips into overdraft, currently –62 DM, and my savings account holds 32 DM. I have one active loan with your bank—the relocation loan of 2 000 DM taken in July 2023—which has been repaid on schedule for the last 15 months. I have no other financial obligations.  

I suggest two equal installments of 702 DM each, to be deducted directly after payday. With steady employment in a blue-chip company and an impeccable repayment record, I trust you will find me a low-risk, reliable client.  

Thank you for assessing my request. I am available at your convenience for further information.  

Respectfully  
Ananya Sharma

Bremen, 27 September 2025  

Dear Ms. Krämer,  

I am Ms. Li-Yun Huang, age 28, married, Taiwanese citizen, and have been a customs officer (civil service grade A7) at the Port of Bremen since January 2022, earning 2 880 DM net monthly. I seek a loan of 1 403 DM to finance a newer Renault Clio, replacing my 2004 model that recently failed its TÜV inspection. Reliable transport is essential for my early-morning rotations and for taking my toddler to the child-minder.  

My giro account is overdrawn by 38 DM due to repair bills. I hold 71 DM in a savings book. In June 2023 your bank granted me a 1 800 DM appliance loan; all 15 installments have been punctually paid via standing order. I have no other debts and no guarantors.  

With a secure civil-service position, a flawless payment history, and the modest size of the requested credit, I am confident of meeting the bank’s risk criteria. I propose repayment in two monthly tranches of 701.50 DM each, starting 30 October 2025.  

Thank you for the opportunity to present my application. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Kind regards  
Li-Yun Huang

Frankfurt am Main, 24 September 2025  

Attention: Retail Lending Section  

I am Ms. Farah Hassan, a 28-year-old Egyptian national, separated, and resident in Germany since 2021. I have been a certified chemical-process operator at BASF SE, Ludwigshafen, since May 2022, earning 3 200 DM net each month. I respectfully request a loan of 1 403 DM for the purchase of a 2019 Toyota Yaris Hybrid to ensure reliable transport for my rotating shifts and for caring duties toward my seven-year-old daughter.  

My current account shows a small negative balance of –59 DM, a result of school-supply expenses. I have 84 DM in savings bonds. I am servicing a 2 300 DM education loan from your branch (granted July 2023) and have met every one of the 15 scheduled payments on time. I rent a two-bedroom flat in Ludwigshafen (720 DM rent) and have no other obligations.  

Given my steady industrial employment, spotless repayment history, and the limited size of the new credit, I believe I am a reliable borrower. I propose to repay in two equal installments of 702 DM via salary deduction.  

Thank you for considering my request. I would be happy to provide payslips, residence permit, or any further documentation.  

With respect  
Farah Hassan
