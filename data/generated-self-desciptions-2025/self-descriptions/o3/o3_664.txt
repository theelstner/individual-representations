Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Josef Novak. For the past eight years I have worked as a precision-mechanics technician at Škoda Transportation’s service depot in Duisburg, where I hold a permanent contract and earn a net €3 100 per month. I am applying for a loan of DM 2 241 to buy new workshop cabinets, a height-adjustable workbench, and safety shelving for my home garage, which I use after hours to produce custom parts that supplement my income.  

Although I do not maintain a checking account, I have twice financed small tools through your bank (DM 1 200 in 2019 and DM 1 500 in 2022) and repaid both agreements several months ahead of schedule. I own my terraced house at Heinrich-Heine-Str. 11, valued by the town at DM 180 000, and I have no other debts. My single dependent—my 16-year-old son Martin—will soon begin vocational school, and the additional income from my evening work will cover his expenses.  

I request an installment plan of DM 56 per month (rate class 4). My steady employment, clean credit record, and unencumbered real-estate ownership make me a reliable borrower. I appreciate your consideration and am prepared to supply any further documentation immediately.  

Sincerely,  
Josef Novak

Esteemed Officers,  

I am Mehmet Demir, a senior customs inspector at the Port of Hamburg. I have served the Federal Customs Service for nine years and currently receive a monthly net salary of €3 450. I respectfully seek a DM 2 241 loan to replace worn furniture and acquire a secure filing cabinet and ergonomic chair for my home study, where I prepare examination material for trainee inspectors.  

During my 21-month history with your institution I have held two small installment contracts, both repaid exactly on time. I hold title to my condominium at Bernhard-Nocht-Straße 28, valued at DM 210 000. Other than a small savings stamp book containing DM 82, I maintain no liquid accounts, yet my payroll is exceptionally stable. I have no guarantors or additional obligations, and my only dependent—my 12-year-old nephew, for whom I am legal guardian—resides with me.  

An installment rate of class 4 aligns comfortably with my budget and leaves ample cushion. My proven payment discipline, civil-service tenure, and real-estate collateral demonstrate that I am a trustworthy applicant. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Mehmet Demir

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Anton Kozlov, request a DM 2 241 consumer loan for the purpose of furnishing a spare bedroom and buying a compact CNC router. For eleven years I have been employed as a certified industrial electrician at BASF Ludwigshafen, earning €3 200 net each month on an unlimited contract.  

I lack a current account because my wages are loaded directly onto a BASF payment card, yet your bank already knows my reliability: the two equipment loans I took out in 2020 and 2023 were repaid without a single late fee. I own my detached house (Land Registry No. 3409/7) outright; it is insured for DM 240 000. Apart from routine household expenses and supporting my 18-year-old daughter through nursing school, I carry no financial burdens.  

A class-4 installment of roughly DM 56 monthly will fit easily within my disposable income while allowing me to expand into small-scale contract milling at home. I am ready to provide employment confirmations or property documents at your earliest convenience. Thank you for considering my application.  

Faithfully,  
Anton Kozlov

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Luís Almeida, senior laboratory assistant at the University Hospital of Cologne. I have held this position for seven years and currently earn €3 050 net. I wish to borrow DM 2 241 to purchase new laboratory-grade shelves, a stainless-steel worktable, and storage chairs for my private workshop, where I tutor medical students on weekends.  

Your bank has financed two prior personal loans for me (DM 900 in 2018 and DM 1 700 in 2021). Both were paid off precisely as scheduled, demonstrating my sense of duty. I possess a registered townhouse at Luxemburger Str. 301 worth approximately DM 190 000 and have no other outstanding liabilities. My only dependent is my 14-year-old son Miguel.  

With a proposed class-4 installment, my monthly obligation would be less than 2 % of my salary—well within safe limits. Despite not keeping a standard checking account, my stable employment, spotless repayment record, and mortgage-free property present minimal risk to the bank. I appreciate your positive consideration and am available for any questions.  

Kind regards,  
Luís Almeida

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Sergey Petrov, a government-licensed heating-systems inspector employed by the City of Munich for the past ten years, drawing a net monthly income of €3 380. I respectfully apply for a DM 2 241 loan to outfit my newly renovated living room with modular bookcases and to acquire a portable combustion analyzer that will enhance my side consultancy business.  

Although I do not operate a checking account, I have held two installment credits with your branch, both concluded in good standing (final payment receipts dated 17 Jan 2022 and 5 Aug 2023). I own my single-family home at Mozartstraße 77, free of encumbrance, assessed at DM 225 000. Apart from supporting my 19-year-old son in technical college, I have no dependents or installment obligations. My savings book holds DM 57.  

The requested amount, repayable at class-4 terms, represents a modest, manageable commitment relative to my secure civil-service salary. My ownership of real estate, impeccable payment history, and decade-long employment certify my reliability. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Sergey Petrov
