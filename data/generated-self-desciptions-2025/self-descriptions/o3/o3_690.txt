Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Fischer, 35, employed as a network technician at Siemens AG in Munich since February 2015 (8 years). I am requesting a loan of 2,753 DM to purchase a 55-inch OLED television and DAB+ radio for my recently renovated condominium.  

Financially, I earn 4,600 DM net per month, own a paid-off 2017 Volkswagen Golf, and hold 420 DM in a savings account with your branch. A previous furniture loan of 6,000 DM was repaid in full last August, and all installments were met on schedule. I have no other debts.  

My sister, Katharina Fischer (teacher, permanent contract), has agreed to act as co-applicant and guarantor. I intend to service the new loan at a 3 % installment rate, which fits comfortably within my monthly budget and still leaves a reserve for my 6-year-old son’s expenses.  

I will open my first checking account with your bank if approved, and I am committed to maintaining the excellent repayment record I have demonstrated. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Fischer

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Daniel Weber, single, 35, and have served as a senior customs officer at Frankfurt Airport since January 2014. I seek a 2,753 DM loan to upgrade my living-room media center with a smart TV, AV receiver, and digital radio unit.  

Income: 4,200 DM net monthly salary, plus a regular annual bonus of about 1,500 DM. Assets: 310 DM in a savings bond and a fully paid 2016 BMW 1-Series. My prior 5,000 DM renovation loan with your bank was cleared three months early this year. I possess no other installment plans.  

My brother, Martin Weber (civil servant with the City of Mainz), will co-sign. A 3 % installment fits easily into my budget; after deductions I retain more than 1,800 DM each month for living costs and my 5-year-old daughter.  

I have proven reliability, own my home for four years, and am ready to open a checking account with you. I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Weber

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Jonas Richter, age 35, single parent to a 7-year-old boy. Since May 2013 I have been a laboratory technician at Bayer Pharma in Leverkusen. I wish to borrow 2,753 DM to purchase a combined radio/TV studio setup that will allow me to continue evening freelance work in educational broadcasting.  

Current financial position: 4,350 DM net monthly wage, savings of 270 DM, and ownership of a 2018 Ford Focus. My only prior liability—a 7,500 DM car loan issued by your bank—was settled in full last December without a single late payment.  

My cousin, Petra Schneider (chartered accountant), acts as co-applicant. The proposed 3 % installment represents less than 8 % of my disposable income, ensuring safe repayment.  

I have lived in my own townhouse for four years, maintain a landline registered in my name, and am eager to establish a current account with your institution. Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Jonas Richter

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Tobias Klein, 35 years old, employed as a mechanical engineering foreman at Bosch Stuttgart since March 2012. I request a loan of 2,753 DM to buy a 4K television and digital radio system for my new home cinema project.  

Monthly income stands at 4,800 DM net; savings amount to 195 DM. I own a 2015 Audi A3 outright. My previous 3,200 DM kitchen appliance loan with your bank was completed exactly on schedule. No other debts exist.  

My mother, Helga Klein (retired municipal clerk, pension 2,000 DM/month), has agreed to co-apply. Planned installments of 3 % can be met comfortably while I continue to provide for my 8-year-old son.  

I have held residence at my own apartment for four years and intend to open a checking account with you upon approval. I trust my flawless repayment history and stable employment demonstrate my reliability.  

Sincerely,  
Tobias Klein

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Patrick Hoffmann, single, 35, and have been a senior postal official with Deutsche Post in Cologne since April 2014. I am applying for a 2,753 DM loan to purchase a high-definition television and digital radio receiver, completing the furnishing of the house I bought last year.  

I earn 4,050 DM net monthly, keep 380 DM in a savings plan, and own a debt-free 2016 Skoda Octavia. My only previous loan—4,500 DM for bathroom remodeling—was serviced through your bank and paid off one month ahead of time.  

My older brother, Lukas Hoffmann (software engineer), will act as co-applicant. The proposed 3 % installment is well within my budget, leaving over 1,600 DM for living costs and my daughter’s childcare each month.  

With four years at my present residence, a stable civil-service contract, and a spotless credit record, I am confident of meeting every obligation. I will also initiate a checking account with your bank once the loan is approved.  

Thank you for your attention.  

Best regards,  
Patrick Hoffmann
