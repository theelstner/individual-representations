Bremen, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Andreas Müller, 39 years old, single, and the father of a seven-year-old boy who lives with me every other weekend. For the past five years I have worked as a forklift operator at EuroPort Bremen, earning a steady net income of 3,150 DM per month. I own a small terraced house in Gröpelingen that I inherited from my parents; the mortgage is down to 42,000 DM, paid punctually through this bank for the last four years.

I am requesting a loan of 3,398 DM to purchase a 2019 Opel Corsa. My 1998 Polo finally failed inspection, and reliable transport is essential for my night shifts as public buses stop running before my shift ends. Although my checking account currently shows a negative balance of 450 DM after school-holiday expenses with my son, my salary will cover the overdraft and the proposed monthly installment of 140 DM without strain. I maintain two small installment plans with your bank, both serviced on time; the combined payment history stands at 42 on-time debits.

I have no other guarantors, but the house offers solid collateral and my employer can confirm my continued appointment. With nearly five years of faultless payroll deposits and property insurance held at this branch, I believe I have demonstrated reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace during office hours should any clarification be needed.

Sincerely,
Andreas Müller

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

I, Sebastian Koch, age 39, respectfully apply for a 3,398 DM auto loan. I have been employed for four years and eleven months as a night-shift picker at DHL’s Köln-Eifeltor distribution center, bringing home 2,880 DM net each month. My ownership of a two-room condominium in Kalk—current market value about 145,000 DM—confirms long-term stability; the unit is mortgage-free thanks to an early inheritance settlement.

The loan will finance a nearly new VW Up! to replace my bicycle commute. After a recent back injury my doctor advised against daily cycling. Public transit is impractical at 3 a.m. when my shift ends. The vehicle is crucial for continued employment and for transporting my nine-year-old niece, for whom I have legal guardianship.

Though my current account shows a 120 DM overdraft and my savings total only 66 DM, my fixed costs are modest: 480 DM condo fees, 390 DM groceries and utilities, and 210 DM school expenses. This leaves over 1,700 DM monthly, more than sufficient for the projected 140 DM installment. I have two existing micro-credits with your bank—both down to their final six payments—documented as never in arrears.

My consistent salary, debt-free property, and spotless repayment record attest to my creditworthiness. I look forward to demonstrating the same reliability on this new facility.

Kind regards,
Sebastian Koch

Dear Banking Team,

I am Markus Lang, 39, single parent of an eleven-year-old daughter, and a maintenance worker for the Munich Municipal Parks Department since June 2019—six years and three months. My net monthly pay averages 3,420 DM paid via standing order into my account here.

I request a 3,398 DM loan to acquire a 2020 Skoda Fabia Combi. The city reassigned me to a new park in Feldmoching, beyond tram service. Reliable transport will guarantee my punctual attendance and enable weekend custody visits to my daughter’s mother in Rosenheim.

My checking account temporarily sits 580 DM below zero due to summer school fees, and my savings are minimal. However, I own a small plot with a two-room cottage in Freimann valued at about 220,000 DM. The property is fully insured and carries no liens after I refinanced an earlier renovation loan, which I have repaid punctually for 38 months.

I already hold two modest consumer loans with your branch—furniture and plumbing—which I service at 110 DM combined per month, never once missing a payment. My overall debt-to-income ratio remains under 25 percent, leaving ample room for the additional 140 DM car installment.

I appreciate your consideration and am confident my employment record and real-estate collateral will satisfy your lending criteria.

Respectfully,
Markus Lang

To the Credit Department,

My name is Tobias Richter. I am 39 years old, unmarried, and provide financial support for my six-year-old son. Since May 2020 I have worked as a stagehand at the Staatstheater Stuttgart, netting approximately 2,820 DM monthly. I live in and own a modest farmhouse in Bad Cannstatt—current loan balance 48,600 DM—always paid on time through this bank.

The requested 3,398 DM will be used to purchase a 2018 Ford Fiesta. Theatre schedules often end after the last S-Bahn, and taxi costs are eroding my budget. Ownership of a car will cut these expenses, ensuring I remain available for overtime calls, which add roughly 320 DM to my monthly income.

Temporary overdraft of 310 DM on my account arose from replacing a broken boiler last month; the insurance payout is due next week and will cover it. My two existing credits here—for the boiler and home insulation—stand in good order with 29 consecutive on-time debits. Outside this bank I keep a small 2,100 DM credit card balance, paid well within limits.

Given my steady employment, verified overtime income, real-estate equity, and unblemished repayment history, I trust the bank will find my application solid.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,
Tobias Richter

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Heiko Schneider, 39, single, with custody of my eight-year-old nephew. For the past four years and seven months I have worked as a night porter at the Hotel Atlantic Kempinski in Hamburg, earning 3,020 DM net plus tips. I reside in a two-floor townhouse in Altona, market-valued at 180,000 DM; only 39,000 DM remain on the mortgage, serviced via automatic debit from my account here.

I seek a loan of 3,398 DM to buy a 2021 Renault Clio. My previous vehicle was written off after an accident; swift replacement is crucial for my 23:00-07:00 shifts, for school runs, and for grocery deliveries to my elderly mother. Taxi costs already exceed the projected 145 DM monthly loan installment.

Presently my account shows an overdraft of 190 DM owing to textbook purchases, and my savings balance is 72 DM. I have two active loans with you—kitchen appliances and roof repair—totaling 87 DM per month, both impeccably serviced for over two years. My only other debt is a small consumer credit at Karstadt, paid down to 600 DM.

Stable hospitality employment, consistent deposits, valuable property, and a spotless payment record make me a reliable borrower. I am reachable through the hotel’s reception desk for further information.

With thanks for your consideration,

Heiko Schneider
