Frankfurt, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ionel Petrescu, a 29-year-old Romanian metal-shop assistant who has lived in Frankfurt for the past two years. Since March 2023 I have been employed full-time by Heller Metallbau GmbH, earning a net salary of 2 300 DM per month plus regular overtime. I am applying for a loan of 3 590 DM to purchase basic furniture and a used computer so I can prepare vocational-school homework in the evenings and provide a proper study corner for my two daughters, ages six and eight, who live with me.  

I currently own a small condominium (17 m² equity paid) that I bought with the help of a Bausparvertrag and a life-insurance policy pledged as collateral. Although my checking account is 720 DM overdrawn, I have never missed a payment on my previous micro-loan with your bank, which I fully repaid in April 2024. Apart from an overdraft and normal household bills, I carry no other debt. My savings account holds 65 DM; however, my co-applicant and cousin, Dragoș Bălan, has agreed to guarantee the new loan.  

Regular employment, documented repayment discipline, and a stable residence make me a reliable borrower. The proposed installment of 184 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget, leaving a 28 % buffer after fixed expenses. I kindly ask you to consider my request so that I may improve my family’s living conditions and continue building a sound credit record in Germany.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ionel Petrescu

Munich, 5 July 2025  

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  

I am Paolo Ricci, an Italian warehouse porter with Dachser SE in Munich since February 2022. I respectfully request a 3 590 DM loan to equip my recently purchased studio with kitchen cabinets, a washing machine, and a child’s bunk bed for my two sons, who stay with me every second weekend.  

Financially, I receive a steady net income of 2 450 DM plus a holiday bonus. My only open credit with your bank—a 1 200 DM bicycle loan taken in 2023—was repaid punctually in May 2024. My Girokonto is overdrawn by 460 DM due to moving expenses, and my savings balance is 42 DM. I also hold a building-society contract worth 6 000 DM, not yet allocated.  

My brother-in-law, Marco Ferraro, permanent resident and technician at BMW, has agreed to act as co-applicant. With his backing and my spotless payment history, I am confident of meeting the planned 24-month installment of roughly 190 DM.  

Granting this loan will allow me to stabilise my household, focus on my job, and continue integrating successfully. I appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Paolo Ricci

Stuttgart, 28 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Samuel Mensah, a Ghanaian CNC-machine helper employed by Bosch Rexroth AG since October 2021. I am applying for a 3 590 DM personal loan to buy ergonomic bedroom furniture and a second-hand lathe for a part-time craft venture I operate on weekends.  

Income: 2 380 DM net monthly. Obligations: none besides rent contribution and utilities; I co-own my flat via a Bausparvertrag started in 2020 and have life-insurance cover of 15 000 DM. My current account shows a negative balance of 815 DM, incurred when my old mattress had to be replaced urgently. I finished repaying a 900 DM education loan with your bank in December 2023 without delay. Present savings: 71 DM.  

My cousin and flatmate, Kofi Owusu (electrical mechanic, Daimler Truck), will serve as guarantor, strengthening the application. The proposed repayment of 180 DM per month is well within my disposable income, and my long-term plan is to convert the weekend venture into a certified trade, improving both my earnings and Germany’s skilled-labour pool.  

I have always honoured my financial commitments, and I look forward to doing the same with this loan.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Samuel Mensah

Hamburg, 1 June 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Artur Šimek, a 29-year-old Latvian dock labourer at Hamburger Hafen und Logistik AG since January 2022. I respectfully request a loan of 3 590 DM to furnish my newly acquired cooperative apartment and to purchase basic tools for evening vocational training in ship mechanics.  

I earn an average net wage of 2 600 DM, including shift allowances. My checking account is currently 680 DM in the red after paying relocation costs. I have a modest savings balance of 58 DM and a building-society savings contract with accrued capital of 5 400 DM as future down-payment.  

In July 2024 I fully repaid a 1 000 DM relocation advance from your bank ahead of schedule. I have no other installment obligations. My elder brother, Juris Šimek, a permanent resident and IT specialist with Otto, stands ready as co-applicant.  

Given my steady income, proven repayment discipline, and additional collateral through my Bausparvertrag and guarantor, I am confident of settling the planned 24 installments of approximately 185 DM. Granting this loan will help me complete my home and advance my qualifications, ultimately strengthening my earning power.  

Thank you for your positive consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Artur Šimek

Düsseldorf, 9 June 2025  

Dear Lending Officer,  

My name is Carlos Almeida, a Portuguese hotel kitchen aide employed by Maritim Hotel Group since April 2023. I seek a 3 590 DM loan to purchase essential furniture, a refrigerator, and a used laptop for language courses and my children’s school projects.  

I take home 2 150 DM monthly, plus meal allowances. Apart from a 300 DM overdraft, I am debt-free; I cleared my prior 1 100 DM consumer loan with your bank in January 2025 as scheduled. My savings stand at 74 DM, but I maintain a 10 000 DM life-insurance policy earmarked for my dependents.  

My cousin, Pedro Silva, a master electrician and German citizen, has agreed to co-sign the loan. Our combined creditworthiness, my stable employment record, and documented punctual repayments make me a reliable applicant. The proposed rate of roughly 190 DM per month leaves me with ample margin after fixed expenses.  

By approving this loan, you will enable me to stabilize my household and focus fully on progressing to a qualified cook position—a step that will raise my income and strengthen my future relationship with your bank.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Almeida
