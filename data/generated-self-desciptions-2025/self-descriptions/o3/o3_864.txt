Stuttgart, 11 Sept 2025  

Dear Loans Committee,

My name is Anna Hoffmann, 35, divorced, with one eight-year-old son. I have been employed for ten months as an administrative officer at the City of Stuttgart, earning a net salary of 3,100 DM per month. I request a loan of 2,439 DM over 24 months to replace the radio and television that were damaged during my recent move.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn by 220 DM, I own a condominium in Bad Cannstatt that I inherited last year and on which only 28 % of the original mortgage remains. I keep a savings balance of 72 DM and have no other installment obligations. The car loan I obtained from your bank in 2021—8,000 DM over 36 months—was repaid punctually last May, demonstrating my reliability.

The requested loan would add a monthly payment of roughly 115 DM, which fits comfortably into my household budget; my fixed costs, including the existing mortgage, amount to 58 % of my net income. I am therefore confident of meeting each installment in full and on time.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship and am available by telephone at 0711 / 295 44 63 for any further information.

Sincerely,  
Anna Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Isabelle Krämer, 35 years old and married, with one dependent daughter. Since January I have worked as a radio-frequency engineer at Siemens Mobility, earning 4,200 DM net per month. I wish to finance 2,439 DM to purchase professional-grade radio and television equipment that will allow me to take on freelance testing contracts from home.

My current account shows a negative balance of 180 DM after recent renovation expenses, and I hold 64 DM in a savings account. I own, together with my husband, a single-family home in Bergedorf valued at approximately 280,000 DM, of which only 54,000 DM remains mortgaged. Our credit record is flawless; a 12-month furniture loan taken last year was settled two months ahead of schedule. We have no other debts or guarantors, and this would be my second credit with your bank.

The new income from side contracts is projected at 600–800 DM monthly, more than covering the expected 115 DM installment. Combined with my salaried position, this ensures sufficient liquidity and a low risk profile.

I have enclosed payslips, property documents, and the previous loan clearance certificate. Please feel free to call me at 040 / 88 73 19 02.

Thank you for your trust and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Isabelle Krämer

Dear Credit Department,

I am Melanie Schulz, 35, separated, and mother to a nine-year-old boy. I have been working as a laboratory technician at BioChem AG for nine months, earning a steady net income of 2,850 DM. I request a 2,439 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new television and radio set for the furnished apartment I rent out on the ground floor of my house.

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 95 DM, mainly due to school expenses. I have 51 DM in a savings account. Nevertheless, I own my residence, purchased in 2018; only 32,000 DM of the original mortgage remains. In 2020 I took a 5,000 DM kitchen loan with your bank and repaid it on schedule, which is reflected in my credit history.

Rental income of 750 DM monthly supplements my salary, leaving ample room for the projected 115 DM installment. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and household expenses stay below 60 % of my combined income.

I value the support your bank has shown me and hope to deepen this relationship. All relevant documents are attached, and I am reachable at 0341 / 92 11 557.

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,  
Melanie Schulz

Dortmund, 15 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Officers,

My name is Katharina Becker, 35 years old and married. For the past six months I have served as a financial clerk at Deutsche Post AG, earning a net 3,000 DM. I seek a 2,439 DM loan to purchase an educational smart-TV and digital radio to support my son’s distance-learning programme.

My checking account stands at −140 DM after unexpected medical bills for my child. Savings are minimal at 88 DM, yet my husband and I own our home in Aplerbeck, valued at 310,000 DM with just 60,000 DM outstanding on the mortgage. Your records show I fully repaid a 3,600 DM study loan in 2022, confirming my punctuality.

The requested loan would require about 115 DM monthly, comfortably below the 30 % debt-service threshold on my income. We have no other installment commitments, and my spouse’s income is reserved for household expenses, adding further stability even though he is not listed as guarantor.

I appreciate your consideration and would be pleased to clarify any point by phone at 0231 / 71 44 909.

With appreciation,  
Katharina Becker

To the Credit Committee,

I am Laura Schneider, 35, divorced, with custody of my ten-year-old daughter. After graduating from the police academy, I have served eleven months as a police officer for the State of Bavaria, earning 3,350 DM net. I am applying for a 2,439 DM loan to install an in-car digital radio and replace our aging television at home.

My checking account is presently −160 DM, while my savings account holds 67 DM. However, I own a small townhouse in the Südstadt district, purchased during my marriage; only 41,000 DM of the mortgage remains. In 2019 I completed repayment of a 6,000 DM education loan with your bank, never missing an installment.

The new loan’s estimated 115 DM monthly payment fits easily within my budget, which allocates just 55 % of income to fixed costs. I have no other debts, and my stable civil-service position offers long-term job security.

Enclosed are pay statements, mortgage details, and my prior credit clearance. I am available at 0911 / 37 55 122 should you need further information.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing a dependable partnership with your institution.

Sincerely,  
Laura Schneider
