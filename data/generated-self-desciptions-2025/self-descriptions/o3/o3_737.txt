Letter 1 – Sofia Ivanova

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Sofia Ivanova. I am 29 years old, Bulgarian, and have lived at Rosenheimer Strasse 87, 81667 Munich for the past two years with my six-year-old son. After my seasonal housekeeping contract at Hotel Prinz ended four months ago, I registered with the Jobcenter and receive 1 450 DM unemployment benefit plus 350 DM child support. My checking-account balance averages 150 DM.

I request a 3 990 DM loan over 36 months to buy a refrigerator, stove and washing machine for the apartment I purchased last month through a subsidised “Eigentum für Alleinerziehende” programme. Two years ago I took an 800 DM furniture loan with your branch and repaid every instalment on the due date. I have no other debts or guarantors.

Starting 1 October, I have a signed contract as a train–cleaning operative with Deutsche Bahn (1 730 DM net). Including the benefit transition, my monthly income will comfortably cover the projected 135 DM repayment. My excellent repayment record, stable residence, and forthcoming employment make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Sofia Ivanova



Letter 2 – Ana Gómez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ana María Gómez, a 29-year-old Spanish divorcee living at Urbanstrasse 14, 70190 Stuttgart, together with my four-year-old daughter. My present account with you shows a positive balance of around 90 DM at month-end.

I wish to borrow 3 990 DM for 36 months to replace broken household appliances in my flat (fridge-freezer, cooker, vacuum cleaner). Although I have been unemployed since July when my warehouse-picker contract at Keiper GmbH expired, I receive 1 380 DM unemployment insurance and 400 DM maintenance payments from my former husband. My monthly budget leaves 220 DM free after fixed costs.

In 2022 I repaid a 1 200 DM relocation loan with your bank three months ahead of schedule. I hold no credit cards, overdrafts or other loans. My long-term plan is to retrain as a forklift driver; I begin the IHK course in January, already financed through the Arbeitsagentur.

My clean repayment history, consistent income and prudent budgeting support my ability to meet the expected 140 DM instalment. I would be grateful for your positive response.

Kind regards,
Ana María Gómez



Letter 3 – Maria Nowak

To the Credit Department,

My name is Maria Aleksandra Nowak, 29, Polish citizen, separated, resident at Escher Strasse 201, 50739 Cologne since August 2021. I respectfully apply for a 3 990 DM consumer loan over 36 months to purchase essential domestic appliances (energy-efficient washer-dryer, oven and water heater).

I am currently between jobs after my temporary assignment as a packaging assistant at Rewe Logistik ended six weeks ago. I receive 1 260 DM Arbeitslosengeld I and 300 DM child allowance for my eight-year-old son. My checking account, held with your Neumarkt branch, seldom falls below 120 DM. Two years ago I took a 900 DM medical-bill loan from you and repaid every instalment exactly on schedule.

I have no other borrowing, no overdraft, and pay my rent from a fixed transfer. From November I will start a confirmed six-month contract as a night-shift sorter with DHL (net pay 1 800 DM), which provides additional repayment security. The proposed monthly instalment of roughly 135 DM fits comfortably within my forecast budget surplus of 290 DM.

Given my proven reliability and forthcoming employment, I trust you will view me as a low-risk applicant.

Thank you very much.

Respectfully,
Maria A. Nowak



Letter 4 – Laila Ahmed

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Laila Fatima Ahmed, a 29-year-old Moroccan national, married but currently living alone with my five-year-old daughter at Hanauer Landstrasse 412, 60314 Frankfurt. I have banked with you since moving to Germany two years ago; my Girokonto normally holds about 180 DM.

I request a 3 990 DM loan repayable over 36 months to equip our flat with a washing machine, dishwasher and child-safe cooker. My previous 1 000 DM emergency-dental loan with your bank (2021) was settled in full last March.

I have been unemployed since February following the closure of the café where I worked as a kitchen helper. I currently receive 1 320 DM unemployment benefit and 280 DM family allowance. My husband, who works overseas, sends a documented 400 DM monthly transfer. Including these funds, my budget allows for a 150 DM instalment while maintaining a 15 % safety margin for unexpected expenses.

My spotless repayment record, consistent inflows, and permanent residence underpin my credibility as a borrower. I look forward to your favourable reply.

Warm regards,
Laila Fatima Ahmed



Letter 5 – Elena Petrova

Esteemed Members of the Loans Panel,

My name is Elena V. Petrova, 29, Romanian citizen, widowed, and resident at Bürgerweide 11, 20535 Hamburg for exactly two years. I am applying for a 3 990 DM personal loan over 36 months to buy essential household appliances: refrigerator, washer, tumble-dryer, and an induction hob. These will make our home safer for my seven-year-old son, who has asthma and needs clean clothes daily.

My Girokonto balances around 100 DM because I prioritise paying bills promptly. In 2020 I took a 700 DM school-books loan from your branch and never missed a payment. I am debt-free elsewhere.

Since June I have been registered as job-seeking after my seasonal job as a harbour cleaner ended. I receive 1 410 DM unemployment compensation and 350 DM orphan’s support. The employment agency has already scheduled me for a three-month forklift-licence course beginning next month, after which I have a written job offer from HHLA with a net salary of 1 950 DM.

Even under current income, the forecast instalment of 140 DM represents less than 8 % of my household cash flow. My consistent payment history, stable residency, and the secured future job demonstrate my credit-worthiness.

Thank you for taking the time to review my request.

Sincerely,
Elena V. Petrova
