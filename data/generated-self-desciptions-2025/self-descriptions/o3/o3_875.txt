Frankfurt, 02 June 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sofia Hernandez, a 24-year-old Spaniard working in Germany as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Frankfurt. I have been employed there for eight months with a net monthly salary of €2,380. Last year I purchased a small condominium in Offenbach valued at €128,000, for which I took a €6,000 renovation loan from your bank. All twelve installments to date have been paid punctually.

I now request an additional loan of €874 to buy a refrigerator and washer-dryer for my apartment. Because I arrived in Germany only a year ago, I have not yet opened a checking or savings account, but my salary is transferred to a prepaid payroll card supplied by my employer and I maintain careful spreadsheets of every expense. I have no other debts, pay my mortgage reliably, and support one child who lives with me.

Owning my home, having a steady research position, and an unblemished repayment record with your bank show that I am a trustworthy borrower. The requested amount is modest, and at the agreed installment rate of four months I can comfortably cover the payment from my regular income.

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to supply any further documentation you may need.

Sincerely,  
Sofia Hernandez

Hamburg, 04 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Mei Zhang, divorced, 24, and employed as a junior customs officer at the Port of Hamburg Authority since September 2024. My net income averages €2,150 per month. I own a small terraced house in Harburg valued at €115,000, purchased with family funds from China; therefore there is no mortgage on the property.

In January I concluded a €1,200 personal loan with your bank to furnish my daughter’s bedroom and have already repaid five installments on schedule. I now apply for a further €874 to replace the broken cooker and dishwasher. With no other liabilities, a monthly household budget surplus of about €800, and living in my own mortgage-free home, I can repay the loan within four months without difficulty.

Although I do not yet have a German checking account—my wages are paid onto a payroll debit card—my prior perfect payment record proves my reliability. I respectfully request your approval.

Kind regards,  
Mei Zhang

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Anna Petrova, a married Bulgarian confectioner working at Café Mohrenplatz in Munich since August 2024. I earn €2,000 net per month plus occasional bonuses. Last summer my husband and I bought a 42 m² studio in Pasing for €122,000; the title is solely in my name and the mortgage is already covered by family savings.

In October I received a €2,000 moving loan from your branch and have paid all installments promptly. I am requesting €874 to purchase an energy-efficient oven and small freezer that will allow me to prepare pastry orders from home and supplement my salary. With no other debts, one dependent toddler, and an average monthly surplus of €650, I can repay the new loan over four equal installments.

Although I have no current account yet, I keep a detailed ledger and transfer payments from my prepaid salary card. I hope my spotless repayment history and ownership of real estate demonstrate my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Respectfully,  
Anna Petrova

To the Lending Department,

I am Fatima El-Khouri, a 24-year-old Syrian engineer employed for nine months as an assistant site inspector with the Stuttgart Municipal Works Office, earning €2,420 net each month. I purchased a small duplex in Bad Cannstatt for €130,000; the mortgage is serviced through a family trust, leaving my monthly housing costs minimal.

In February this year you granted me a €1,500 credit for relocation expenses; the six installments made so far have all been on time. I now seek a loan of €874 to buy a washer-dryer and vacuum cleaner for my new home. My budget allows for repayments of up to €300 monthly, well within the proposed four-month term.

I do not yet maintain a German checking account because my residency permit was issued only last year; wages are loaded onto a Comdirect salary card. Nevertheless, my consistent payment record, stable public-sector job, and property ownership make me a low-risk applicant. I attach my employment contract and payslips for verification.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Fatima El-Khouri

Cologne, 07 June 2025  

Dear Ms. Schneider,

I am Laura González, a separated 24-year-old registered nurse at St. Marien Hospital, Cologne, where I have worked since July 2024. My net salary is €2,300 per month. Last year I invested my savings and a family inheritance in a small bungalow in Porz valued at €118,000, which I now own outright.

In December I obtained a €900 loan from your bank to cover licensing fees for my German nursing registration; all payments have been executed precisely on schedule. I am applying for €874 to replace an obsolete boiler and purchase an induction hob for my kitchen. With no other debts or installment plans and an average monthly surplus of €780, repayment over four installments poses no strain.

I acknowledge that I still lack a traditional checking account; however, my wages are deposited on a hospital-issued debit card from which I make SEPA transfers. My proven repayment discipline, secure healthcare employment, and unencumbered property attest to my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available at the branch anytime for further discussion.

Warm regards,  
Laura González
