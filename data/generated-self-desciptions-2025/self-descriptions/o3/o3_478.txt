Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Daniel Popescu, a 24-year-old Romanian citizen working in Frankfurt since April 2023 as a certified electronics technician at Siemens Energy. I am applying for a DM 2 569 loan over 39 months to purchase a 2017 Volkswagen Polo with 68 000 km. Reliable personal transport will cut two hours from my daily commute and let me pick up my six-year-old niece from school when my sister works late.  

Financially, I earn a net DM 2 950 per month and have repaid my existing small appliance loan with your bank—DM 1 200—six months ahead of schedule. I set aside DM 140 each month and currently hold DM 820 in my savings book. I own a modest studio apartment purchased from my savings last year. Apart from the planned car loan I carry no other debt, leasing, or credit-card balances.  

My employment contract is open-ended, my probation period is over, and my team leader can confirm my performance. I request an installment of DM 80 (rate 4) which fits comfortably within my budget. Though I do not yet maintain a checking account, I am ready to open one with your bank so all salary and installments flow through a single institution.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my work number 069-87 11 301 or in person at any time you suggest.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Popescu

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Carlos Mendes, a Portuguese biomedical laboratory assistant employed by the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf since June 2022. To improve my mobility and assume weekend on-call duties, I seek a DM 2 569 loan for a used 2015 Opel Corsa.  

Monthly net income: DM 3 120. Savings balance: DM 940. I have one prior credit with your bank—DM 2 000 for relocation costs—repaid in full and on time last February. I own a small condominium (19 m²) bought with family support; there is no mortgage. I support my widowed mother who lives with me, hence one dependent. I neither possess credit cards nor any other installment plans.  

With a repayment term of 39 months and an installment of roughly DM 80, my debt-to-income ratio remains below 3 %. Stable employment, an unblemished repayment record, and modest living costs underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your favorable review and look forward to building a broader banking relationship with you.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendes

Respected Loan Officer,  

My name is Ahmed Khan, age 24, originally from Pakistan and presently employed as a CNC machinist at Robert Bosch GmbH since January 2024. I request a DM 2 569 consumer credit to purchase a 2016 Ford Fiesta (75 000 km). Dependable transport is essential for the rotating early shift that starts at 5 a.m., when public buses are infrequent.  

Income: DM 2 780 net per month. Savings: DM 610 in a Sparkasse account. Existing credit at your branch—DM 1 500 for vocational tools—has been serviced punctually for 18 months, with seven remaining installments. No other debts or guarantees. I reside in a small house I inherited from my late uncle; the property is mortgage-free.  

The proposed installment rate of 4 equals DM 80 monthly, well within my disposable income even after child support for my four-year-old son. My supervisor can attest to my permanent contract and strong attendance record.  

I value punctuality, both at work and in financial obligations, and I am confident you will find my application meets your lending standards.  

Thank you for your time.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Ms. Schneider,  

I am Luka Ilić, a Serbian customs documentation clerk at Fraport AG, employed since November 2021. I seek a DM 2 569 loan over 39 months to acquire a 2014 Skoda Fabia Combi. The car is needed to cover split shifts at the airport and to transport my nephew, whom I support, to speech-therapy appointments.  

Current net salary: DM 3 010. Savings held: DM 780. I successfully closed a DM 1 800 study loan with your bank in July 2025, never missing a payment. My living situation is secure; I own a modest cottage bought in cash from inheritance funds. There are no other borrowings, credit cards, or guarantors connected to me.  

The planned repayment of DM 80 a month represents just 2.6 % of my income, assuring comfortable service of the debt. A permanent contract, four years at the same residence, and a spotless credit record highlight my reliability.  

I would be delighted to discuss any details you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Luka Ilić

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Piotr Nowak, 24, a Polish national working as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Bahn AG since May 2023. I respectfully request a DM 2 569 loan to purchase a used 2018 Renault Clio. The vehicle will enable me to cover multiple DB offices in Brandenburg and to take my younger brother, for whom I am legal guardian, to weekend rehabilitation sessions.  

I earn DM 3 200 net per month. I hold DM 930 in a Bundesbank savings bond and have never overdrawn any account. My previous credit with your institution—DM 2 200 for professional certification—was settled three months early this June. I own my apartment outright, purchased from savings before relocating to Germany. No other liabilities exist.  

With a 39-month term and DM 80 monthly installment (rate 4), I will maintain a comfortable surplus of over DM 1 500 after fixed expenses. My department head can verify my unlimited contract and strong performance metrics.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to continue my positive relationship with your bank.  

Best regards,  
Piotr Nowak
