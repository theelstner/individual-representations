Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Carlos Mendes, 63, Portuguese national residing in Berlin since 2019. I am applying for a five-year loan of 13,756 EUR to purchase a new Volkswagen ID.3 that will enable me to visit clients outside the city in my work as an independent management consultant.

I have run Mendes Strategy GmbH for the past eight years and currently invoice an average of 7,800 EUR net per month. After taxes my disposable income is roughly 5,300 EUR. My only fixed credit obligation is a 430 EUR education loan with Bankia in Madrid, never in arrears. The proposed instalment of about 280 EUR for the requested loan is well within my budget.

Although I do not yet hold a current account with your bank, I have had a small equipment loan with you since 2020 and have honoured every payment on time. I live rent-free in a company flat and have one dependent—my 22-year-old son at university.

My steady income, clean payment record and the fully insured vehicle to be pledged in your favour make me a reliable borrower. Tax returns, contracts and statements are available on request.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to building a broader banking relationship with you.

Sincerely,
Dr. Carlos Mendes



Dear Lending Committee,

I am Mr. Ashok Sharma, 63, single, proprietor of Sharma Healthcare Supplies in Hamburg. I respectfully request a 13,756 EUR, 60-month loan to purchase a new Ford Transit Connect essential for delivering medical consumables to my customers.

For nine years I have managed the company, generating an audited net profit of approximately 64,000 EUR per year. My personal net income is about 5,000 EUR monthly. I service a 210 EUR/month stock-financing line at Volksbank and have a three-year equipment loan with your bank opened in 2021, always paid on schedule. The proposed car loan instalment of around 280 EUR fits easily into my cash flow.

I live rent-free in an apartment above my warehouse and support one dependent, my widowed sister. Aside from normal household costs my obligations are modest.

Though I do not keep a current account with you, my spotless repayment history, strong earnings and the collateral value of the vehicle provide ample security. Balance sheets and tax assessments are enclosed.

Thank you for your confidence.

Kind regards,
Ashok Sharma



Dear Credit Department,

My name is Peter Weiss, 63, single, Lieutenant Colonel (ret.) of the Austrian Air Force and, for the past seven years, Security & Compliance Manager at SkyPort Cargo GmbH in Munich. I seek a 13,756 EUR loan over 60 months to buy a new Audi A3 e-tron needed for commuting and transporting my 14-year-old niece, of whom I am legal guardian.

My gross salary is 96,000 EUR; 5,400 EUR net arrives in my Raiffeisen account each month. I pay 420 EUR monthly on a mortgage with Erste Bank and hold a small 5,000 EUR personal loan from your bank taken in 2022, serviced flawlessly. Housing is provided by my employer, so I incur no rent.

With fixed costs under 1,200 EUR, the planned 280 EUR instalment is easily affordable. In addition, I receive a lifelong officer’s pension that supplements my salary.

My disciplined payment record, documented income and the fully insured vehicle as collateral make me a safe credit risk. Payroll statements and pension certificates can be supplied immediately.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Peter Weiss



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Michael O’Connor, 63-year-old Irish software architect employed for the past eight years by EuroGrid AG in Leipzig. I am requesting a 13,756 EUR loan, repayable over 60 months, to purchase a new Tesla Model 3 that complies with our firm’s sustainability goals for client visits.

My net income averages 6,100 EUR per month (gross 120,000 EUR annually). I hold a 12,000 EUR education loan with Santander (260 EUR/month) and a 2,000 EUR consumer credit with your bank opened in 2021, both serviced without delay. I live rent-free in a company apartment and support one dependent—my daughter finishing her master’s degree.

The projected instalment of about 275 EUR is comfortably within my disposable income. Though I have no current account with you, my high, stable earnings and perfect repayment history demonstrate reliability. I will set up automatic debit and provide all supporting documents.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Yours faithfully,
Michael O’Connor



Dear Loans Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Hakim, 63, Egyptian-German citizen, founder and managing director of NileTech Engineering GmbH in Düsseldorf. I request a 13,756 EUR, 60-month loan to buy a new Mercedes-Benz C-Class for site visits and to transport my 11-year-old grandson, who lives with me.

NileTech has produced audited post-tax profits averaging 70,000 EUR annually for the past decade. My personal net income is 5,800 EUR per month. I carry a single machinery lease with Commerzbank at 350 EUR/month and maintain a 7,500 EUR bridge loan from your bank issued in 2020, paid punctually.

I reside rent-free in a family-owned home, keeping fixed costs low; the planned 280 EUR car instalment is well covered. I have never missed or delayed a payment, and the vehicle will be registered as collateral in the bank’s favour.

I trust the enclosed financial statements and insurance confirmations demonstrate my creditworthiness. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Ahmed El-Hakim
