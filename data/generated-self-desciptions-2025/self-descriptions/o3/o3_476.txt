Frankfurt, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, age 33, married and father of a six-year-old son. I have been employed for 3 years as a scientific research assistant at Fraunhofer-IGD, earning a net salary of 3 200 DM per month. I respectfully request a loan of 1 245 DM, repayable over 18 months, to purchase a combined digital radio/television set for my family.

My current checking balance is 152 DM and my savings account holds 84 DM. I maintain one small furniture loan at another bank, always paid on time, and one minor loan with your institution that will be fully settled in four months. All installments, including the proposed one (4 % of my income), are comfortably covered by my salary after household expenses.

I own our apartment in Offenbach and a 2019 Opel Corsa, giving me stable collateral. Although I do not have a landline, you may reach me through my employer’s switchboard and my direct supervisor, Dr. Meier, who has enclosed a reference confirming my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my good relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Carlos Ortiz, a married 33-year-old industrial electrician working at MAN Truck & Bus SE for the past 2 years. My net monthly income is 3 050 DM. I apply for a loan of 1 245 DM over 18 months to upgrade our living-room entertainment system so my wife can enjoy Spanish satellite channels and our daughter can use educational TV programs.

My checking account currently shows 97 DM; my savings book, 56 DM. I have one modest auto loan at Sparkasse (remaining balance 860 DM) and one small instalment plan with your bank, never in arrears. All my obligations, including the requested loan, would keep my total instalment ratio below 20 % of net income.

We own our condominium in Giesing and a 2020 Seat Ibiza, which attest to our financial stability. Enclosed are employment and salary confirmations as well as a reference from my union representative, Mr. Schmid, attesting to my punctual, responsible character.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I will be pleased to provide any further information.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Ortiz

Esteemed Credit Board,

My name is Ivan Petrov, a widowed foreign worker aged 33, employed since February 2023 as a certified CNC machinist at Bosch Rexroth AG, earning 3 400 DM net monthly. I respectfully seek a loan of 1 245 DM for 18 months to purchase a modern smart TV and DAB-radio set for my son and me.

I keep about 124 DM in my checking account and 78 DM in a savings bond. An earlier study loan with Deutsche Bank—rated “critical” after a temporary delay during my wife’s illness—was brought current and closes in December. I also have a small consumer loan with your branch; payments have never been missed. The new installment will represent 4 % of my income and leave ample buffer.

I reside in my own townhouse in Bad Cannstatt, share no other debts, and possess a fully paid 2018 VW Golf. Though I lack a home telephone, my plant manager, Mr. Krämer, is available for verification and has provided the attached recommendation.

I appreciate your consideration and assure you of timely repayment.

Faithfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Hamburg, 9 September 2025  

To the Lending Department,

I am Marko Kovács, 33, married, living in our owner-occupied flat in Altona with my wife and our eight-year-old daughter. For the last 1 year and 7 months I have worked as a customs documentation officer at HHLA, earning 2 900 DM net monthly.

I apply for a loan of 1 245 DM, term 18 months, to replace our outdated television and install a quality radio system so my family can follow news from Hungary and Germany alike. My current account balance is 68 DM; savings stand at 42 DM. I have one small renovation loan with another bank (current balance 1 100 DM) and one existing loan with your bank; both are serviced punctually. The added installment keeps my overall repayment load at 17 % of net income.

Our paid-off 2017 Skoda Octavia and flat provide tangible assets. Though I do not maintain a telephone, my supervisor, Ms. Thomsen, confirms my reliability and can be contacted during office hours.

Thank you for evaluating my request. I am committed to honoring every repayment.

Respectfully,  
Marko Kovács

Düsseldorf, 8 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Nikola Jovanović, age 33, married, with one dependent son. I have been a logistics coordinator at Henkel AG for 2 years and 3 months, earning a steady net salary of 3 150 DM. I seek a loan of 1 245 DM for 18 months to acquire an energy-efficient TV-radio combo; our current set failed and repair costs exceed replacement value.

Present balances: checking 183 DM, savings 95 DM. My credit file shows a previous mobile-phone contract classified “critical” after late fees two years ago—settled in full. I also have a small home-improvement loan with your bank, paid without delay. Including the requested loan, my combined installments equal 18 % of monthly income, well within safe limits.

Ownership of our townhouse in Benrath and a 2021 Renault Clio demonstrate financial stability. Although I lack a landline, HR at Henkel (contact: Frau Weber) will verify employment and character.

I appreciate your trust and look forward to continuing a mutually beneficial relationship.

Sincerely,  
Nikola Jovanović
