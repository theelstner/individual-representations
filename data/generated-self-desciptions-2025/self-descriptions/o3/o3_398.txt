Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Kovács, a 55-year-old divorced Hungarian citizen who has been living in Stuttgart for the past four years. I am applying for a loan of 2 578 DM to purchase basic furniture and a laptop so that I can begin my new position as a shift-planning supervisor at DHL on 1 July.  

Until last year I worked for twelve years as Operations Manager at TransDanube Logistics in Budapest, earning a steady net income of 4 200 DM per month. Unfortunately the branch closed and I have been registered as unemployed since June, which explains the current overdraft of 360 DM on my checking account and the lack of savings. During this time I have never missed a payment on my previous 1 800 DM consumer loan with your bank, which was completed in February.  

Starting next month my net salary will be 3 800 DM. I propose a fixed monthly instalment of 90 DM over 30 months, well within the 3 % service rate indicated. My housing is free in exchange for caring for my sister’s child, so my disposable income will quickly cover both living expenses and repayment.  

My long employment record, the recent job contract already signed, and my impeccable repayment history should demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Sincerely  
Maria Kovács

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Dr. Leila Farouk, a 55-year-old Egyptian national, legally resident in Germany since 2019 and separated. I request a loan of 2 578 DM to equip the treatment room in the dental practice that I will be co-leasing in Kassel from September.  

From 1993 to 2022 I owned “Farouk Dental Care” in Alexandria. After selling the clinic I moved to Germany to join my daughter, a master’s student in Munich. I am currently registered unemployed while my German licence recognition is finalised (expected in August), explaining the temporary overdraft of 420 DM and my limited savings of 78 DM.  

I previously held a 50 000 EGP commercial loan with Banque Misr, fully repaid in 2021 without delay. Likewise, the 1 200 DM consumer credit I took from your bank last year for language courses is being serviced punctually and will be cleared in November.  

My future net income, based on a signed partnership agreement, is projected at 5 000 DM per month. I can therefore meet an instalment of 100 DM over 30 months comfortably. My free accommodation in my sister’s house further secures liquidity.  

I trust my professional standing and spotless credit record qualify me for this modest loan and thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards  
Dr. Leila Farouk

To the Credit Department,  

I am Carmen Ruiz-Meier, 55, married, and a Spanish foreign worker residing in Hamburg since 2019. I am seeking financing of 2 578 DM to furnish the unfurnished apartment that my family will move into next month.  

For fifteen years I served as Senior Accountant at Grupo Calima in Madrid, earning 3 700 DM monthly. After relocating to Germany to follow my husband’s research post, I was laid off due to the move and am presently registered as unemployed; my balance is therefore 210 DM overdrawn and my savings stand at 55 DM.  

I have, however, never defaulted: my 2 500 € mortgage in Spain and the 1 000 DM education loan with your bank (repaid in April) were both serviced on time. I start a part-time bookkeeping role at HanseMarine GmbH on 15 June with net pay of 2 000 DM.  

With rent-free accommodation provided by the university, my household budget easily supports a 90 DM monthly repayment over 30 months. My accounting background and history of punctual payments should reassure you of my reliability.  

Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Respectfully  
Carmen Ruiz-Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Anna Petrova, a 55-year-old divorced Bulgarian citizen who has lived in Frankfurt for four years. I am applying for a 2 578 DM loan to buy essential household equipment and a workstation desk.  

I retired as a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Bulgarian Army in 2021 after 28 years of service, where I managed logistics budgets of up to 3 million BGN. Since moving to Germany I have been studying German full-time; the stipend ended in March, leaving my account 300 DM in the red and savings of only 60 DM.  

Despite the tight interim finances, I repaid a 2 000 BGN car loan at UniCredit Bulbank and a 1 500 DM relocation credit from your bank without a single late instalment. As of 1 August I have a signed contract with Rhein-Secure GmbH as a security consultant, net salary 3 500 DM.  

Because I live rent-free in a service apartment, I can allocate 100 DM monthly over 30 months to clear the requested loan. My military record, proven budgeting skills, and clean credit history underscore my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully  
Anna Petrova

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am Helena Novak, a 55-year-old widowed Croatian entrepreneur with permanent residence in Cologne since 2020. I request a credit of 2 578 DM to purchase display shelves and a cash register for the market stall I will reopen in July.  

From 2000 to 2020 I owned “Novak Handcrafted Gifts” in Zagreb, employing six staff and generating annual turnover of 120 000 € until the pandemic forced closure. My subsequent unemployment led to a current overdraft of 390 DM and minimal savings of 44 DM, yet I maintained every payment on my previous 2 200 DM training loan with your bank, settled last month.  

I have secured a permit and a prime spot at the Cologne Old Town Market and expect average net earnings of 2 800 DM per month, based on conservative sales projections. Living rent-free with my brother and supporting only one dependent grandson, I can comfortably meet a 95 DM monthly instalment over 30 months.  

Two decades of profitable self-employment, a spotless repayment record, and detailed sales forecasts testify to my creditworthiness. I would be honoured to continue my banking relationship with you through this loan.  

Sincerely  
Helena Novak
