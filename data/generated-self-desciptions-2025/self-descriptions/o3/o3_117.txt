Stuttgart, 24 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Thomas Bauer, 47, senior mechanical technician at Daimler Truck AG, where I have been permanently employed for nine years. I am applying for a loan of €3,578 over 48 months to purchase professional-grade radio and television equipment. This hardware will allow me to launch a small online talk-show about classic cars, an activity that will generate side income while showcasing German engineering.  

Financially, my net salary is €3,400 per month. I own a detached house in Leonberg, valued at €480,000 and mortgage-free since last year. I have one dependent—my 11-year-old son—and no guarantors or other installment plans beyond a €1,200 consumer loan already held with your bank, which I have serviced punctually for 16 months. My credit obligations outside your institution amount to €6,000, with payments up-to-date.  

Although I do not yet keep my current account with you, I am prepared to do so, and my stable employment, real-estate ownership, and spotless repayment record demonstrate reliability. The requested loan’s monthly rate of approximately €95 comfortably fits within my budget, representing less than 3 % of my net income.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Martin Schneider, 47, single, and systems administrator at the Munich City Treasury Office for ten years. I seek a €3,578 loan, repayable over 48 months, to replace the outdated TV broadcasting monitors in my home-based e-learning studio, which I run evenings and weekends. Upgrading the monitors is essential to keep my courses on municipal IT security compliant with current streaming standards.  

My gross annual salary is €66,000; net monthly income is €3,200. I live alone with my 17-year-old nephew, whom I support. I own a two-bedroom condominium in Schwabing valued at €390,000; only property taxes apply. Besides a €4,500 installment loan with Sparkasse (current balance €1,100), I hold a €2,000 overdraft facility that has never been drawn. Your bank granted me a small consumer loan last year, which I have repaid on time each month.  

I maintain meticulous payment records, proven by employer references and the enclosed SCHUFA statement. Moving my salary account to your institution is planned upon approval. The projected €95 monthly installment falls well below the 40 % debt-service rule and will not strain my budget.  

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply any additional documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Martin Schneider

Leipzig, 24 June 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Alex Grünwald, certified automotive electrician with BMW Leipzig, employed there for eight consecutive years. I request a €3,578, 48-month loan to purchase a high-definition workshop TV and diagnostic radio receiver set used for continuing-education tutorials that BMW streams internally. Owning the equipment at home will let me study after shifts and qualify for a master technician program, raising my long-term earning power.  

I earn €3,050 net monthly, own a 120 m² townhouse (market value €310,000) with no liens, and have one dependent—my 12-year-old daughter. My credit record shows one micro-loan (€1,500) with your bank, paid punctually for the past 20 months, and a €5,800 car loan at Volksbank in good standing. No other debts exist.  

Despite not yet holding a checking account here, I will transfer my salary if my application is successful. Stable employment, property ownership, and consistent on-time payments underscore my reliability. The new installment of roughly €95 represents three percent of my net income, easily affordable.  

Thank you for your time and favorable judgment.  

Respectfully,  
Alex Grünwald

Bremen, 24 June 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Jens Vogel, 47, laboratory technician at Fraunhofer IFAM, where I have served for twelve years. I wish to finance €3,578 over 48 months to install a specialized radio-frequency television receiver that will allow me to monitor aerospace-composite testing streams broadcast from our partner sites. Access at home expedites my report writing and qualifies for employer reimbursement once the equipment is operational.  

My net monthly income is €3,600, supplemented by an annual research bonus of about €2,000. I own a mortgage-free apartment in Bremen-Nord currently valued at €350,000 and live there with my 14-year-old son. Other obligations include a €2,800 educational loan at Deutsche Bank, paid down from €10,000 without a single late installment, and a €1,000 revolving line with your bank, also spotless.  

Although I have no checking account with you yet, I am willing to consolidate banking services. My long, uninterrupted employment, property assets, and exemplary repayment history demonstrate that I am a low-risk borrower. The monthly payment of about €95 is fully covered by my discretionary income.  

I would be grateful for your approval and remain available for questions.  

Sincerely,  
Jens Vogel

Hamburg, 24 June 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Patrick Weiß, 47-year-old customs officer at Hamburg Hafen, serving the Federal Customs Administration for eleven years. I request a €3,578 loan repayable over 48 months to acquire a professional-caliber television and digital radio set. The equipment enables me to complete the distance-learning modules required for my promotion to Chief Customs Inspector, which are delivered via encrypted broadcast.  

My secure civil-service salary is €3,280 net per month. I own a small terraced house in Barmbek worth approximately €330,000; it has been debt-free since 2019. I support my 15-year-old niece who lives with me. My only current credit is a €1,400 renovation loan with your bank, serviced flawlessly for 18 months. External credit consists of a €5,200 personal loan at Volksbank, also paid on schedule.  

I keep detailed financial records and can provide payslips, property deeds, and a positive SCHUFA report. I am ready to open a checking account with you so installments can be debited directly. The expected €95 monthly payment equals under 3 % of my income, ensuring comfortable servicing.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.  

Best regards,  
Patrick Weiß
