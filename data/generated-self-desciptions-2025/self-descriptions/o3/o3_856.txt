Dear Loan Committee,  

I wish to apply for a 10 875 EUR, 36-month loan to purchase a new Volkswagen Caddy that will replace my 18-year-old van. Reliable transport is essential for taking my two sons to school and for commuting to my job as a certified mechanical technician at Bosch Thermotechnik, where I have worked continuously for eight years.  

Although my credit file shows two late-paid installments in 2019, I have maintained a perfect repayment record on my two existing loans with your bank since then. My net income is 3 400 EUR per month, and, after household expenses, I can comfortably meet the projected 325 EUR monthly installment. I own my detached house outright and can offer the current vehicle (insured value 7 000 EUR) as additional collateral.  

I have no checking account because I have always used my Bosch salary card and a savings passbook, but I am ready to open an account with you as part of this application. My stable employment, owned property, and responsible conduct over the past five years testify to my reliability. I would be grateful for your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am requesting a 10 875 EUR loan, repayable over 36 months, to purchase a new electric Renault Mégane for daily travel between my home and the Finanzamt Hamburg-Süd, where I have served as a senior tax inspector for ten years. As a single father supporting my twin daughters, dependable transportation is crucial.  

My monthly net salary is 3 650 EUR. Apart from two small ongoing loans with your bank—both serviced punctually since 2020—I have no other debts. A brief payment delay in 2018 was due to a medical emergency and has been fully resolved. I own my condominium (market value approx. 240 000 EUR) and maintain full-coverage life insurance that can be pledged as secondary security.  

Though I currently manage my finances through a prepaid card rather than a checking account, I am prepared to open one with your institution immediately. My long public-service career, stable income, and clean record over the past five years make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Salvatore Moretti

To the Credit Department,  

I hereby apply for a 10 875 EUR vehicle loan for 36 months. I need a reliable new Škoda Octavia to replace my aging car, ensuring punctual arrival at Julius-Maximilians-University, where I have worked as a senior laboratory assistant in the Biochemistry Institute for nine years.  

My average monthly net pay is 3 100 EUR, and my expense plan leaves a surplus of 1 050 EUR—ample to cover the proposed 315 EUR installment. I acknowledge a delayed payment on a furniture loan in 2017; since then, my two current loans with your bank have been serviced on schedule. I own my townhouse (no mortgage) and have comprehensive car insurance that can be assigned to the bank.  

Because the university pays me through a payroll card, I have never opened a checking account; I would welcome doing so at your branch. My stable employment, home ownership, and demonstrated repayment discipline underpin my reliability.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am seeking a 10 875 EUR, 36-month loan to acquire a new Toyota Proace for both family and duty travel. I serve as a customs officer at Munich Airport and have held this position for seven years. Dependable transport is indispensable given my rotating shifts and responsibility for two dependent nephews living with me.  

My net monthly income is 3 200 EUR. The planned 320 EUR repayment fits within my budget, leaving a 900 EUR safety margin. I recognize a past delay in 2018 during a family relocation, yet my two active loans with your bank have since been paid without a single reminder. I own my single-family home (insurance value 210 000 EUR) and a classic motorcycle that can be listed as assets.  

I do not yet have a checking account; my salary is loaded onto an AirportPay smart card. Opening an account with you will streamline my finances and further strengthen our relationship. I believe my public-sector employment and asset base prove my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Best regards,  
Viktor Novak

Esteemed Lending Team,  

I write to request a 10 875 EUR loan over 36 months to buy a new Ford Transit Connect, vital for my commute and for transporting my children to extracurricular activities. I have worked for twelve years as a certified track-maintenance engineer with Deutsche Bahn Infrastruktur.  

My current net salary is 3 550 EUR. After all monthly expenses, I retain about 1 100 EUR, comfortably covering the projected 330 EUR payment. While I experienced a brief repayment delay in 2016 after a temporary work stoppage, I have since maintained an impeccable record on my two outstanding loans with your bank. I own my duplex home and a fully-insured camper van, providing tangible security.  

I have managed personal finances with a wage card and a small savings booklet (<100 EUR balance) but am ready to open a full checking account at your branch. My long-term employment, substantial equity, and clean repayment record for the past nine years testify to my reliability.  

I look forward to your favorable response and to expanding my banking relationship with you.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Santos
