Frankfurt am Main, 18 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ivan Petrov, a 28-year-old Bulgarian tool-and-die maker employed with Siemens AG in Frankfurt for 5 years and 2 months. I am applying for a loan of 2,284 DM over 24 months to purchase a new 55-inch smart television and accompanying audio receiver for my recently purchased condominium.

Although I do not hold a current account, I have managed my finances responsibly through cash budgeting and a small savings passbook (present balance: 74 DM). I own a 2016 VW Golf, have lived at my address for two years, and support one child who stays with me on weekends.  

In 2022 I took a 3,000 DM furniture loan with your bank and repaid it six months ahead of schedule, demonstrating my reliability. My net monthly income of 3,150 DM easily covers the planned instalment rate of 4 (≈105 DM per month) alongside my other obligations, of which there are none.

I respectfully request your consideration and am available at the number on file for any additional information.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am José Luis Hernández, single, 28, employed as a certified CNC technician at BMW’s Munich plant since June 2020 (4 years 3 months). I seek a 2,284 DM, 24-month loan to buy a high-quality television set for my new apartment, where I have lived for two years.

My gross salary is 4,000 DM per month; after taxes I net 2,650 DM. I keep less than 100 DM in a small savings book and handle daily expenses in cash, hence no current account. I own a 2015 Opel Astra, have no other debts, and support my younger brother while he studies—my sole dependent.

In 2021 your bank granted me a 1,500 DM consumer loan that I repaid precisely on schedule, earning a perfect payment record. With stable employment, owned housing, and a clear history, I am confident of meeting the agreed instalments of approximately 105 DM.

Thank you for considering my application.

Kind regards,  
José Luis Hernández

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, age 28, single, resident in Germany since 2016 and registered as a skilled automotive electrician at Daimler Truck AG, where I have worked for 6 years 7 months. I request a 2,284 DM loan for 24 months to purchase a home-cinema television system that will also serve as a language-learning aid for my son.

Despite not maintaining a checking account, I operate within a strict budget and currently hold 62 DM in a savings book. I possess a 2014 Ford Focus and have owned my townhouse in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt for two years. My net monthly income of 2,900 DM leaves ample room for the projected monthly instalment.

In 2020 I took a 2,200 DM renovation loan with your institution and repaid it four months early, confirming my reliability. I have no guarantors or other credit lines.

I look forward to a positive reply and am happy to provide any supporting documents.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Hamburg, 25 Sept 2025  

To the Loan Approval Team,

I am Marko Novak, a Croatian national, 28 years old, employed for 4 years 11 months as a certified harbor crane operator at HHLA in Hamburg. I wish to finance a 2,284 DM high-definition TV and satellite receiver over 24 months.

I own a cooperative apartment acquired in 2023 and a 2017 Skoda Octavia. I manage daily finances in cash and have a savings balance of 81 DM; thus no checking account exists in my name. My monthly take-home pay is 2,750 DM, and I have no outstanding liabilities apart from the previous 2,500 DM appliance loan from this bank, fully settled last year.

Given my consistent employment, timely repayment record, and modest living costs, the monthly instalment of roughly 105 DM will be comfortably met.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Marko Novak

Berlin, 26 Sept 2025  

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Dariusz Kowalski, age 28, single father to a six-year-old daughter. I have been an IT support specialist at Deutsche Bahn in Berlin since May 2019, totaling 5 years 4 months of steady employment. I am requesting a 2,284 DM loan, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a smart television and soundbar for educational and entertainment use at home.

I own my condominium in Lichtenberg and drive a 2015 Renault Clio. I keep 53 DM in a savings book and operate without a current account, preferring prepaid and cash transactions. My net salary is 3,000 DM per month, and I hold no other installment plans.

In 2022 I obtained a 1,800 DM computer equipment loan from your bank; all payments were made on or before their due dates. This spotless record, coupled with stable income and minimal fixed expenses, assures my capacity to meet the planned 4-rate instalments.

I appreciate your consideration and am reachable by telephone at any time.

With best regards,  
Dariusz Kowalski
