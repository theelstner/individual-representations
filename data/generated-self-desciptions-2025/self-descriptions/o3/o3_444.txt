Cologne, 15 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Max Berger, 29, single, with a four-year-old daughter. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the University of Cologne for 2 years and 3 months, earning a steady net salary of 3 800 DM. I request a loan of 2 629 DM over 20 months to buy a used delivery van so I can expand the weekend catering service I run beside my full-time job.  

My current checking account stands at 180 DM and my savings book holds 80 DM. I own a small 55 m² flat and a 2014 Volkswagen Golf. I already have two small installment contracts with your bank that are being paid punctually; a single late payment six months ago—caused by an unexpected kindergarten fee—was cleared within the same month.  

Because my employment is secure, my debt-to-income ratio is low, and I have never defaulted, I believe I am a reliable candidate. All installments will be paid automatically from my payroll account, and I can provide salary slips and employment confirmation on request. You can reach me anytime at 0221-651234.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Max Berger

Munich, 14 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Lukas Hoffmann, 29, single, legal guardian of my 13-year-old brother. For the past three years I have been employed as a technical draftsman at Siemens AG with a net monthly income of 3 300 DM. I seek a 2 629 DM loan for 20 months to fund an advanced CAD certification course and purchase a professional laptop, both essential to secure my upcoming promotion.  

My checking balance is currently 90 DM; my savings account holds 20 DM. I reside in my own 42 m² condominium and drive a 2016 Ford Focus. I maintain two existing credits with your bank and have repaid 68 % of them. A single delayed installment in May 2024, due to an emergency car repair, was settled the following payday.  

With a stable career path, property ownership, and automatic payroll deduction available, I am confident I will meet every payment on time. I can be contacted at 089-771122.  

Kind regards,  
Lukas Hoffmann

Stuttgart, 13 Sept 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Daniel Fischer, 29, municipal clerk for the City of Stuttgart for 1 year 8 months, earning 3 100 DM net. I wish to borrow 2 629 DM for 20 months to cover notary fees and basic renovation of an apartment I recently inherited.  

At present my current account shows 45 DM and my savings balance is 60 DM. I live in my own apartment (acquired in 2022) and own a 2012 Opel Corsa. I have two ongoing loans from your bank—both on schedule. One installment was late last December because of a short payroll delay; it was paid in full within ten days.  

My public-sector job, modest expenses, and willingness to set up direct debit assure you of timely repayment. I am available at 0711-443322 for further questions.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Fischer

Hamburg, 12 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Jonas Keller, a 29-year-old single father of a five-year-old boy. For 2 years 6 months I have worked as a skilled metalworker at the Bosch turbine plant, earning a stable 3 250 DM net monthly. I request a 2 629 DM, 20-month loan to buy a portable CNC tool kit that will let me start a small evening workshop, increasing my income.  

My checking account shows 130 DM; my passbook savings stand at 70 DM. I own a 2008 Mercedes A-Class and have lived in my own 48 m² flat for three years. I maintain two active credits with your bank (for a washing machine and a holiday), both current. A delayed payment from October 2023 resulted from a two-week plant strike and was immediately rectified.  

I offer automatic deduction from my wage account and can supply employment proof. Reach me at 040-558877. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Jonas Keller

Frankfurt am Main, 11 Sept 2025  

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Philip Mayer, 29, single, guardian of my three-year-old niece. For 3 years 2 months I have served as an IT support technician for Deutsche Bahn, earning a net salary of 3 600 DM. I am applying for a 2 629 DM loan, repayable over 20 months, to consolidate recent medical bills and cover my niece’s kindergarten fees until year-end.  

My current account holds 110 DM and my savings account 10 DM. I live in my own 50 m² condominium and drive a 2015 Skoda Fabia. I currently have two credit lines with your bank, both serviced punctually. The only lapse—during a hospitalization in April 2024—was settled before the next billing cycle.  

With stable employment, modest living costs, and direct payroll transfer available, I am confident of meeting every obligation. You may reach me anytime at 069-660099.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Philip Mayer
