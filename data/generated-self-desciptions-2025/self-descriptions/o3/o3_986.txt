Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Miguel Alvarez, 30, a Spanish national working in Bremen as a certified forklift driver for Hanse-Logistik GmbH since May 2020 (net income 2,150 DM). I am applying for a loan of 2,028 DM over 24 months to buy a child’s bedroom set and a used washer-dryer for the flat I recently bought.  

Although I have no current account with your bank, I service two instalment loans you granted me in 2023 (together 5,400 DM). All payments have been booked on or before the due date. My only other credit is a 600 DM mail-order account that will be cleared next month.  

Assets include a building-society savings contract (Bausparsumme 7,500 DM, paid‐in 1,200 DM) and a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 4,300 DM. I keep less than 100 DM in a postal savings book because most of my earnings go toward the mortgage on my 32 m² condominium (430 DM / month) and support for my six-year-old son who lives with me. Despite a single late payment four years ago—now fully settled—my record since has been spotless.  

My steady work history, ownership of my home, and existing life-insurance assignation provide solid security. I respectfully request your favourable consideration and look forward to deepening my banking relationship by opening a current account once the loan is approved.  

Thank you for your time.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Andrei Petrovic, 30, a Croatian kitchen porter employed by Atlantic Hotel GmbH since March 2019 (net income 1,980 DM). I wish to finance 2,028 DM worth of basic furniture—sofa, wardrobe, and desk—for the small flat I purchased last year.  

I currently handle two running loans with your institution (total balance 3,900 DM). Statements show a perfect payment history. Outside your bank I still owe 800 DM to Möbel-24, which is being reduced by 50 DM monthly.  

Because I send part of my wages to my eight-year-old daughter in Split, I hold only 70 DM in savings. Nevertheless, I have maintained a BHW Bausparvertrag (contract value 10,000 DM, deposits up to date) and hold a Zurich Leben policy worth 5,000 DM that I am willing to pledge.  

Though I have no phone and no current account yet, my employer will confirm stable, full-time employment (six-day rota). I have lived at the same address for two years and never missed a rent-or-loan instalment. Your continued trust will help me furnish my flat and concentrate on advancing to commis-chef next year.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to a positive reply and to moving my salary payments to your bank.  

Kind regards,  
Andrei Petrovic

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Jamal N’Doye, 30, Senegalese, single father of a seven-year-old boy. I have worked for DHL Paketzentrum Dortmund as a night-shift sorter since June 2018, earning 2,020 DM net per month. I seek a 2,028 DM loan over 24 months to acquire a computer workstation and ergonomic chair that will allow me to start a part-time online-trading activity from home.  

I already repay two consumer loans with you (6,200 DM original amount); both are in good standing. An earlier overdraft at another bank caused a “critical” note in 2020, but it was paid in full and closed. No other instalment plans exist.  

Assets:  
• Building-society savings contract, paid-in 1,500 DM  
• Life insurance (AXA), surrender value 4,900 DM  

Because most of my income goes to my mortgage (460 DM) and childcare, my liquid savings remain under 100 DM, yet my payment discipline is documented. The requested instalment of roughly 100 DM fits comfortably within my budget.  

My stable employment, owned residence, and assignable life policy make me a low-risk borrower. Approving this loan will help me improve my earning capacity, which ultimately strengthens my ability to meet all obligations to the bank.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Jamal N’Doye

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I, Marek Novak, 30, a Polish construction helper at Bau-Team Sachsen GmbH since April 2019 (net pay 1,890 DM), hereby apply for a 2,028 DM credit payable over 24 months. The funds will cover essential tools and a solid wardrobe for my recently renovated studio apartment.  

My relationship with your bank began two years ago with a 3,000 DM consumer loan, followed by a 2,500 DM bicycle loan; both accounts are current, never overdue. I have no guarantors or additional debts apart from a 1,200 DM store card, cleared by December.  

Although I keep less than 100 DM in savings, I own the flat I occupy and hold a Bausparvertrag (contract value 8,000 DM) plus a life-insurance policy worth 6,100 DM, which can be ceded as collateral.  

Being a foreign worker without a telephone or current account might seem atypical, yet five years of uninterrupted employment and two years at the same residence prove my stability. Your continued support will let me upgrade my equipment, increasing my productivity and earnings, thereby further reducing the bank’s risk exposure.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to your favourable answer.  

Sincerely,  
Marek Novak

Dear Lending Manager,  

I am Chen Wei, 30, Chinese national, employed full-time as a steward at Rhein-Klinik Catering Services since February 2020. My net salary is 2,000 DM. I request a loan of 2,028 DM for 24 months to buy a quality sofa bed, dining set, and shelving for the condominium I purchased last year.  

Two existing loans with your bank (home appliance and e-bike, total outstanding 4,700 DM) have been paid punctually for 18 months. I additionally hold a 900 DM hire-purchase contract at another retailer, serviced without delay.  

While my cash reserve is only 80 DM, I contribute regularly to a Debeka Bauspar plan (target 9,500 DM) and own a life-insurance policy with a current paid-up value of 5,400 DM, which I am willing to assign as security. Housing costs are limited to my mortgage payment of 450 DM, leaving ample room for the new instalment.  

My steady four-plus-year employment, property ownership, and flawless recent repayment record demonstrate reliability. Approval of this modest loan will help me create a stable home for my five-year-old son, strengthening my commitment to remain in Cologne and continue banking with you.  

Thank you for your consideration and for the excellent service I have enjoyed thus far.  

Warm regards,  
Chen Wei
