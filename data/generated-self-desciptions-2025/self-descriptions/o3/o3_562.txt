Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a loan of 2,964 DM to purchase a reliable used Opel Astra Kombi that will allow me to commute to the University of Hohenheim, where I have worked as a scientific research assistant in the Department of Agronomy for the past eight years. My current employment contract is unlimited, and my net salary of 4,300 DM per month comfortably covers my living expenses and those of my two teenage children.  

Although my checking account is presently overdrawn by approximately 600 DM due to school fees paid in advance, I have never missed a payment on my existing furniture credit with your bank, which will be fully repaid next May. I have no other debts, own no property, and live rent-free in a university flat, which keeps my fixed costs low.  

With an agreed term of 24 months and installments of about 124 DM, the requested loan fits easily into my monthly budget. My steady employment, clean credit record, and past punctuality with your bank underline my reliability. I would therefore be grateful for your positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Frank Keller

Dear Loan Committee,  

For twelve years I have served as a master electrician at the BLG Logistics terminal in Bremen, earning a secure net income of 4,800 DM per month. To reach early-morning shifts that public transport does not cover, I require a dependable second-hand Volkswagen Caddy. I respectfully request a loan of 2,964 DM over 24 months.  

My payroll is routed through my checking account with your bank, which is currently 350 DM in the red after dental costs for my younger daughter. I repay 170 DM monthly on an existing small renovation loan with you—always on time and due to finish in seven months. Apart from that, I have no liabilities or guarantors.  

Because I live rent-free in a company apartment and have maintained continuous employment since 2013, my disposable income will comfortably absorb the new installment of roughly 124 DM. My spotless repayment history demonstrates that you can rely on me.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Michael Richter

Dear Banking Team,  

I have worked as a senior postal clerk with Deutsche Post for nine years (permanent contract, net salary 4,050 DM). To continue weekend custody visits to my two children, I need a used but economical Ford Focus. I therefore ask for a 2,964 DM car loan, payable over two years.  

My Girokonto shows a negative balance of 420 DM after school clothing purchases, yet I have never defaulted on any obligation. A 3,600 DM consumer loan taken with you in 2022 is being repaid punctually at 150 DM per month and will be cleared in four months. I carry no further debt and reside without rent in my brother’s annex, which limits my fixed outgoings.  

The projected installment of about 124 DM will leave more than 1,600 DM surplus each month, assuring smooth repayment. My stable income, long employment, and flawless credit history confirm my trustworthiness.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Thomas Weiss

Dear Sir or Madam,  

For over eight years I have been a pharmaceutical laboratory technician at BioPharm GmbH, currently earning 4,600 DM net per month. I am seeking a 2,964 DM loan to buy a certified used Skoda Fabia Combi, which will replace my aging motorbike and ensure safe transport for my sons, aged 14 and 11.  

While my Giro account shows an overdraft of 480 DM after unexpected medical bills, I hold no savings account and no property. My only active credit—a 5,000 DM bank loan for professional training—has been serviced flawlessly since 2021 and will be settled in December. I have no other obligations.  

Living rent-free in my parents’ former house keeps my fixed costs minimal, and the planned 24-month installment of 124 DM represents less than 3 % of my monthly income. My proven repayment discipline, long-term employment, and stable family environment underline my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Andreas Bergmann

Dear Credit Officer,  

I have been employed for ten years as a station supervisor with Deutsche Bahn, with a permanent contract and a net monthly salary of 4,250 DM. To maintain shift flexibility, I wish to purchase a used Renault Kangoo and am requesting a loan of 2,964 DM over 24 months.  

My checking account currently shows an overdraft of 530 DM because I paid the annual music tuition for my elder daughter. I have one remaining bank loan—1,800 DM for household appliances—on which I have never missed a payment; it will be fully repaid in March 2026. I possess no other debts, assets, or guarantors, and I live rent-free in railway staff housing.  

With a monthly surplus of roughly 1,900 DM after all expenses, the new installment of about 124 DM fits easily into my budget. My decade-long uninterrupted employment and impeccable repayment record substantiate my creditworthiness.  

I would be pleased to discuss my application in person and thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
Jürgen Hoffmann
