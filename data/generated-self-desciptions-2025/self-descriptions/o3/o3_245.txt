Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a DM 1,185 business loan to buy a refurbished 3-D printer for a side prototyping service I launched last year. I have been employed for 2 years and 3 months as a scientific research assistant at the Alfred Wegener Institute, earning a net DM 3,200 per month. My only dependent is my six-year-old daughter.

Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I already have two small installment loans here (DM 650 and DM 900) and have never missed or delayed a payment. My personal credit record outside your bank is likewise spotless. I own the condominium in which I live; its appraised value is DM 92,000 and it is mortgage-free, giving you tangible collateral. My savings are modest (DM 74), but my stable salary and low fixed costs enable me to service the requested loan comfortably: I propose a 12-month schedule with DM 105 monthly installments.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to strengthening my banking relationship with you and am happy to provide any additional documents.

Sincerely,  
Maria Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a DM 1,185 loan to purchase starter inventory for an online specialty-tea shop I am opening next month. For 1 year and 8 months I have worked as a senior filing officer at the Hamburg City Hall, earning DM 2,850 net. My husband remains in Bulgaria, so I support our four-year-old son alone.

I have no checking account at your branch yet, but both consumer loans I hold with you (balances DM 410 and DM 780) have been repaid on schedule for 14 months. I own a small townhouse valued at DM 105,000 with no liens, which underscores my long-term stability. Apart from a DM 90 emergency fund, I hold no significant savings, yet my monthly budget leaves DM 600 after all expenses, far above the DM 105 installment I request for this twelve-month facility.

My consistent repayment history and secured property make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Alina Petrova

Dear Credit Committee,

I am applying for a DM 1,185 loan to upgrade kitchen equipment for the Vietnamese-fusion catering business I run on weekends. I have been a laboratory technician at MedTech GmbH for 3 years, earning DM 3,050 net. I am separated and care for my five-year-old son.

Your bank currently holds two loans in my name (original totals DM 500 and DM 960), and I have paid every installment early. Outside obligations are limited to a DM 220 monthly cooperative fee. I reside in and own a mortgage-free studio apartment worth DM 86,000. Though my liquid savings are only DM 52, my steady income covers the planned DM 105 monthly repayment with ample margin.

My proven payment discipline and real-estate collateral make me a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to a positive response.

Respectfully,  
Sophia Nguyen

Dear Ms. Schneider,

Please accept my request for a DM 1,185 loan to finance licensing and marketing for my newly registered translation agency. For the past 1 year and 11 months I have served as a junior customs officer at Munich Airport, earning DM 2,970 net. I am divorced and support my seven-year-old daughter.

I hold two performing loans with your bank (current balances DM 240 and DM 630) and retain no other debt. My condominium, purchased with inheritance and valued at DM 98,000, is unencumbered. Besides a small DM 80 savings balance, I maintain a disciplined budget that will comfortably cover a 12-month repayment plan of DM 105 per month.

Given my public-sector position, clear repayment record, and property ownership, I trust you will view my application favorably. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Carla Rossi

Dear Lending Department,

I hereby apply for a DM 1,185 loan to buy refurbished laptops for a weekend coding-course business I am launching for immigrant women. I have been employed for 1 year and 4 months as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Lufttechnik AG, with a net monthly income of DM 3,120. I am married, and we have a two-year-old son; my husband is still abroad and does not yet contribute financially.

Your institution already finances two small obligations of mine (DM 600 and DM 820), both serviced without delay. Apart from these, I carry no debt. I live in a mortgage-free apartment that I own, valued at DM 93,000. My liquid savings are DM 67, but my monthly surplus after expenses is DM 740, allowing me to meet a DM 105 installment over twelve months with ease.

My steady employment, perfect payment history, and real-estate collateral confirm my reliability. I look forward to partnering with your bank as I expand my entrepreneurial activity.

Warm regards,  
Hana Kim
