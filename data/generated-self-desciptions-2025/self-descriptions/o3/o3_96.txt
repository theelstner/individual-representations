Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Hans Grüninger, a master tool technician with Daimler Truck AG in Stuttgart. I have been with the company for eight years and earn a steady net income of 4 800 DM per month. I am requesting a 1 318 DM loan, repayable over twelve months, to complete the down-payment on a new Volkswagen ID.3 that will replace my 17-year-old Opel Astra. Reliable transportation is essential because I work rotating shifts that begin before public transit operates.  

Financially, I keep my checking balance between 100 DM and 150 DM to avoid idle funds, and I hold 12 600 DM in a Sparkasse savings account. My current mortgage is in its final five-year tranche and is serviced punctually through payroll deduction. A small 2019 renovation loan with your bank was repaid three months early, demonstrating my repayment discipline. I have no other debts or guarantees outstanding.  

With real-estate collateral, a long and stable employment record, and a history of honoring every credit obligation, I trust you will consider me a low-risk borrower. I am comfortable with the proposed installment of roughly 115 DM, which represents less than 3 % of my net monthly income.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Hans Grüninger

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dieter Klein, senior clerk in the Würzburg Land Registry Office, where I have served for ten years with civil-service status (Besoldungsgruppe A8). My net monthly salary is 3 950 DM. I request a 1 318 DM loan over twelve months to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e for commuting and for transporting my 12-year-old son to school and sports.  

My financial situation is sound. I own my residence outright, valued at approximately 320 000 DM, and maintain 8 000 DM in savings bonds. My checking account seldom exceeds 180 DM because I transfer surplus funds to a higher-interest account. I previously financed a kitchen remodel with your bank in 2020 and repaid the balance on schedule last December. I have no open installment plans or guarantor obligations.  

Given my secure public-sector position, unblemished repayment history, and conservative budget—this loan’s installment would be roughly 110 DM, under 3 % of my income—I believe I meet your criteria for a trustworthy borrower.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Markus Feld, laboratory research assistant at BASF SE in Ludwigshafen, employed since 2016 with a current net income of 4 300 DM per month. I am applying for a 1 318 DM twelve-month loan to help finance a new Peugeot e-208. The vehicle is vital for my daily 46-kilometre commute, especially for early-morning sample deliveries that cannot be delayed.  

I maintain 1 200 DM in my checking account and 10 500 DM in a Festgeld savings product. I possess no consumer debts other than a mortgage taken in 2005, which is serviced without issue. My previous 2018 personal loan with your bank (for solar-panel installation) was repaid two months ahead of schedule.  

With home ownership, a solid savings cushion, and a spotless repayment record, I trust you will view this request favourably. The monthly installment of about 110 DM is well within my budget and will be managed via automatic transfer.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Markus Feld

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Ralf Behrendt, senior conductor with Deutsche Bahn, based in Kassel, and have been in continuous service for fifteen years. My average net income, including allowances, is 4 100 DM a month. I seek a 1 318 DM loan over twelve months to finalize the purchase of a new Škoda Fabia, replacing a high-mileage company lease that is being returned.  

Financial overview: checking balance ranges around 120 DM; savings with Volksbank amount to 6 400 DM; no outstanding loans except a 1999 mortgage that is current. My prior credit with your bank—a 2017 bathroom modernization loan—was settled exactly on schedule. I carry no other installment obligations and have never acted as guarantor.  

Home ownership, consistent railway employment, and punctual repayment history underscore my reliability. The expected monthly payment of 110 DM is less than one week’s salary, which I will service through standing order.  

I would appreciate your favourable approval.  

Sincerely,  
Ralf Behrendt

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Thomas Berger, IT systems specialist at Deutsche Telekom in Bonn, employed for twelve years with a secure net salary of 5 200 DM per month. I am applying for a 1 318 DM, 12-month loan to supplement my cash payment for a new Renault Zoe. The electric car aligns with my employer’s sustainability program and will replace my 2006 petrol Golf.  

My current account seldom exceeds 160 DM, as surplus funds are directed to a savings account holding 11 800 DM. I own my detached house, mortgage balance 38 000 DM, serviced flawlessly since 1998. In 2021 I completed, ahead of schedule, a 2 500 DM loan from your bank for roof repairs. I have no other debts or guarantees.  

Given my long-term employment, strong savings, property collateral, and impeccable credit record, I am confident of meeting the monthly repayment of roughly 110 DM without strain.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Warm regards,  
Thomas Berger
