Frankfurt, 15 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Mehmet Kaya, a 52-year-old Turkish citizen who has worked as a forklift driver with Lufthansa Cargo at Frankfurt Airport for the past nine years. I am applying for a loan of 2 315 DM to purchase a new colour television and radio set for my home.  

Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn, I have always met my financial obligations. In 2021 I took a 4 000 DM roof-repair loan from your branch and repaid every instalment on time and in full. My net income is 3 100 DM per month, and with no other debts or guarantors, the proposed instalment rate of 3 will fit comfortably into my budget.  

I own the condominium in which I have lived for four years, giving the bank an additional layer of security. My only dependent is my 17-year-old daughter, whom I also support punctually. I may not have significant savings, but my stable employment record, real-estate ownership, and spotless repayment history demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Kaya

To the Credit Committee,  

I am José Alvarez, single, 52, and have been a night-shift security guard at the Siemens South Campus for eight years. I respectfully request a 2 315 DM consumer loan to buy a combined radio/television system so my 15-year-old son and I can follow educational programming from home.  

My prior 2 500 DM consumer credit with this bank (granted in 2019) was settled six months ahead of schedule. I currently earn a steady 2 850 DM net per month, own the town-house where I have resided for four years, and hold no other instalment plans.  

Though my checking balance is temporarily negative and my savings account stands at only 63 DM, my real-estate equity and consistent salary ensure that I can meet the requested instalment rate of 3 without difficulty. My track record of punctual repayment and long-term employment underpin my suitability as a borrower.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
José Alvarez

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Piotr Nowak. For ten years I have worked as a janitor at the Kreuzberg Municipal School, where I earn 2 700 DM net each month. I wish to obtain a 2 315 DM loan to purchase a satellite television and digital radio that will allow my son and me to access news from both Germany and Poland.  

In 2020 I repaid a 3 000 DM renovation loan with your bank without missing a single instalment. I live in a small flat that I own outright and have occupied for four years. Apart from one dependent—my 13-year-old son—I have no financial obligations.  

My current account shows an overdraft, and my savings are modest (41 DM), yet my real-estate asset, decade-long employment, and flawless credit record attest to my reliability. The planned instalment rate of 3 represents less than 9 % of my monthly income, which I can comfortably accommodate.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Nowak

Esteemed Members of the Lending Team,  

I, Ivan Petrovic, a 52-year-old Croatian national, have been employed on the assembly line at Volkswagen AG for twelve years. I seek a 2 315 DM loan to acquire a modern television set with integrated radio so that I can follow professional training broadcasts offered by the company.  

My previous 5 000 DM car-repair credit with your institution (2018-2022) was honoured without delay. Presently I earn 3 250 DM net per month, possess no other instalment contracts, and hold clear title to the detached house where I have lived for four years.  

While my checking account is 270 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is only 52 DM, the combination of stable income, valuable property, and an unblemished repayment history makes me a low-risk applicant. The requested instalment rate of 3 fits well within my monthly budget, leaving ample margin for unforeseen expenses.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrovic

Hamburg, 24 June 2025  

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Samuel Ndlovu, 52 years old, and have served as a maintenance technician for the Hamburg Housing Cooperative for eight years. I hereby apply for a 2 315 DM loan to purchase a high-definition television and radio, which will assist both my German-language studies and my 14-year-old daughter’s school projects.  

In 2019 your bank granted me a 3 500 DM heating-system loan that I repaid exactly as scheduled. My net monthly income is 2 900 DM, and I hold clear ownership of my terraced house, occupied continuously for four years. I maintain no other credits, guarantors, or instalment obligations.  

Although my current account shows a minor overdraft and my savings balance is only 37 DM, my long-term employment, spotless payment record, and real-estate collateral demonstrate my creditworthiness. The instalment rate of 3 represents a manageable share of my income.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that, once again, I will prove to be a dependable customer.  

Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Ndlovu
