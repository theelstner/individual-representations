Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ana Marquez, a 31-year-old Spanish national living in Berlin for the past four years. I have been employed as a certified geriatric nursing assistant at St. Joseph Senior Center since December 2024 (net income €2,100). Because the late shifts start before public transport runs, I need a reliable vehicle; I have found a well-maintained 2017 Opel Corsa for €2,901 and request a ten-month loan for this amount.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account, I have managed my finances with a prepaid debit card and have never overdrawn. I fully repaid a €1,000 education loan last year and am currently paying down a €600 relocation credit from your bank—every installment has arrived early. Rent is €720, and I have no other debts.  

I own a small apartment in Seville inherited from my parents, which underscores my long-term stability. As a divorced mother of one five-year-old daughter, dependable transport is essential for both work and childcare. My employer can confirm my contract and punctual salary payments; I am happy to supply payslips, tax registration and property deeds.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my proven repayment record, steady income, and tangible collateral make me a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Ana Marquez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Lijuan Chen, 31, a Chinese research laboratory technician employed at BioPharm GmbH in Munich since February 2025. My net salary is €2,400, and I have lived at my current address for four years. I seek a €2,901 loan over ten months to purchase a 2016 VW Golf to ensure punctual arrival for 6 a.m. laboratory shifts.  

My credit history is spotless: a €1,200 laptop loan from your bank was repaid three months ahead of schedule. I carry no other debts, have one three-year-old son, and my husband’s income covers household expenses, leaving my salary fully available for loan installments of approximately €290 per month.  

I do not yet keep a German checking account—wages are paid onto a company card—but I intend to open one with your institution if this application is approved. As additional security, I can present the deed to four hectares of family farmland in Jiangsu Province, China.  

I value punctuality and scientific precision in my work and finances alike, and I am confident you will find me a reliable customer. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Lijuan Chen

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Silvia Rossi. For ten months I have served as an administrative clerk at the Frankfurt City Council, earning €2,350 net monthly. As a separated mother to a seven-year-old boy, I need dependable transportation to shuttle between school and the office; hence my request for a €2,901 loan to buy a 2015 Ford Fiesta.  

I have rented my current flat for four years and maintain a perfect payment record. Last year your bank granted me a €500 furniture credit; all payments have been executed on the agreed dates, and the balance will be cleared in December. I hold no other liabilities and spend only 32 % of my income on fixed costs.  

Although I do not operate a checking account, I control spending via a payroll card and keep meticulous spreadsheets. I also own a 20 % share of my family’s house in Naples, providing long-term security.  

Please find attached my employment confirmation and recent pay slips. I trust my steady municipal position and spotless repayment history demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower.  

Kind regards,  
Silvia Rossi  
c/o Frankfurt City Council, Kleyerstr. 22, 60326 Frankfurt

Dear Loans Officer,  

I am Katarina Petrova, 31, working as a certified dental assistant at SmileBright Clinic in Hamburg since January 2025 with a net income of €2,000. Public transport does not cover my split-shift hours, so I plan to purchase a used 2015 Škoda Fabia priced at €2,901. I request financing for ten months.  

My financial conduct is verifiable: a €700 relocation loan from your bank was settled exactly on schedule last June, and I previously repaid a Bulgarian student loan without incident. Current monthly commitments (rent €750, kindergarten €210) leave ample room for the proposed €290 installment.  

While I rent in Germany, I own a 600 m² plot near Varna registered in my name. I currently manage funds through a prepaid Mastercard but intend to move to a full current account with you.  

As a divorced mother of a four-year-old girl, reliability is my highest priority, both professionally and financially. I am confident the documents enclosed will confirm my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Warm regards,  
Katarina Petrova

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Maria Velásquez, 31 years old, Colombian citizen and foreign-trade compliance officer at GlobalTrade Logistics in Bremen since April 2025. My net monthly salary is €2,600. I apply for a €2,901 loan, repayable in ten months, to purchase a 2016 Toyota Yaris essential for my daily 35-km commute and evening childcare duties.  

Your bank previously extended a €1,200 language-course credit, which I repaid one month early. Apart from my current rent of €820, I carry no fixed obligations. I allocate a maximum of 28 % of income to living costs, ensuring sufficient liquidity for the planned installments.  

Though I lack a local checking account, my employer pays wages onto a SolarisPay card, and statements confirm a consistent positive balance. As additional reassurance, I co-own a family coffee farm in Antioquia valued at approximately €40,000, free of liens.  

Married with a two-year-old son, I have a strong incentive to maintain an impeccable repayment record. I enclose employment verification, residence permit, and farm ownership certificates for your review.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a favorable response.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Velásquez
