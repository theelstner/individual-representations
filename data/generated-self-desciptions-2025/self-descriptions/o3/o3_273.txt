Frankfurt, 03 May 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Anna Schneider, 37, divorced with one daughter. I request a loan of 1 402 DM to buy a child-safe bedroom set and a compact computer so my daughter can study at home.

Employment and income  
• Scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt, employed 5 years, net salary 2 950 DM.  
• Permanent contract; public-sector pay scale.  

Assets and liabilities  
• Savings book at Frankfurter Sparkasse: 820 DM.  
• Car: 2019 Opel Corsa, fully paid (≈5 000 DM).  
• One small appliance loan at Volksbank (outstanding 660 DM, 55 DM/month).  
• One education loan with your bank, always on time.  

I have no checking account; my salary is booked to my savings account and all bills are paid by standing order. A past “critical” notice from my divorce was settled in full two years ago, and I have never missed a payment since. Rent, car insurance and the 55 DM installment leave me with more than 1 500 DM free each month, so a 120 DM repayment over 12 months is easily affordable.

My department head, Prof. Dr. Breuer, will confirm my reliability. I am reachable at my registered landline (069-55 21 47).

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a long-term relationship with your bank.

Sincerely  
Dr. Anna Schneider

Hamburg, 04 May 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Constanze Müller, age 37, married, and a senior customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority. I apply for a loan of 1 402 DM to equip my home office with an ergonomic desk and secure filing cabinet required for remote inspections.

Employment and income  
• Civil-service status, 6 years in post, net salary 3 280 DM.  

Assets and liabilities  
• Savings book at Hamburger Sparkasse: 910 DM.  
• 2020 VW Polo, fully paid.  
• One personal loan at Hansebank (balance 1 120 DM, 95 DM/month).  
• One study loan with your bank (payments current).  

We rent the same Altona flat for 4 years. My salary is transferred to my wife’s account; I do not yet keep a checking account myself. All obligations are paid via standing orders. With fixed costs of about 1 400 DM, a 120 DM monthly installment is no burden.

My public-sector tenure and flawless payment history make me a reliable borrower. I can be reached at 040-712 99 83 for any further information.

Kind regards  
Constanze Müller

Cologne, 05 May 2025

To the Credit Department,

I am Elena Petrova, 37, separated and mother of one. I request 1 402 DM to replace worn-out living-room furniture and purchase a washing machine damaged during my recent move.

Employment and income  
• Laboratory technician at Bayer HealthCare, Leverkusen, 5 years, net salary 2 620 DM.  

Assets and liabilities  
• Savings at Stadtsparkasse Köln: 765 DM.  
• 2019 Ford Fiesta, value ≈4 800 DM.  
• Appliance loan at Kreissparkasse (remaining 540 DM, 45 DM/month).  
• One credit with your bank, always punctual.  

A 2021 divorce briefly created a “critical” entry, cleared in February 2022; since then my record is spotless. I have rented the same Cologne flat for 4 years. With rent and existing installments I still keep over 1 300 DM free each month, enough to cover a 120 DM repayment schedule.

I intend to open a checking account with your bank if the loan is approved. Reach me at 0221-879 61 54.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully  
Elena Petrova

Stuttgart, 06 May 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Sabine Hoffmann, 37, married with one child. I apply for a loan of 1 402 DM to purchase a bunk bed, storage units and a study desk for my son.

Employment and income  
• Insurance claims clerk at Allianz, 5 years, net salary 3 040 DM.  

Assets and liabilities  
• Savings at BW-Bank: 870 DM.  
• 2021 Škoda Fabia, no financing.  
• Consolidation loan at LBBW (balance 980 DM, 82 DM/month).  
• One credit with your bank, payments up to date.  

No checking account yet; all standing orders go from my savings book. A minor arrear in 2019 (utility bill) is the only “critical” note on record, settled immediately. Our family has rented the same Bad-Cannstatt apartment for 4 years. Fixed charges leave about 1 500 DM monthly surplus, so a 120 DM installment is comfortable.

Please contact me at 0711-226 14 82 if additional documents are required. I appreciate your positive decision.

Sincerely  
Sabine Hoffmann

Düsseldorf, 07 May 2025

Respected Credit Committee,

I am Teresa Alvarez, 37, divorced, and an official translator for the District Court of Düsseldorf since June 2019. I seek a loan of 1 402 DM to purchase professional audio equipment and a lockable bookcase for court-mandated home hearings.

Employment and income  
• Court translator, 6 years’ tenure, net salary 2 780 DM.  

Assets and liabilities  
• Savings at Stadtsparkasse Düsseldorf: 935 DM.  
• 2022 Renault Clio, paid in full.  
• Personal loan at Commerzbank (balance 730 DM, 61 DM/month).  
• One credit with your bank, never in arrears.  

We have lived in the same rented flat for 4 years. A 2020 separation triggered a short-term critical entry, resolved within two months; no issues since. After rent and fixed costs I keep about 1 300 DM free monthly, enough to service a 120 DM repayment over 12 months.

I value punctuality and transparency and will gladly provide any further evidence of solvency. Feel free to reach me at 0211-379 44 29.

With best regards  
Teresa Alvarez
