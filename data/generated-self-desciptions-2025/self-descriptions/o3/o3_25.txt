Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Stefan Popescu, a 44-year-old Romanian national who has lived in Stuttgart for the past four years. I respectfully request a loan of 1,804 DM to buy a reliable 2017-registered Opel Corsa so I can commute to my new workplace.

I have been employed for nine months as a scientific laboratory technician at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a net 3,400 DM per month. My checking account averages 120 DM, while my Bausparvertrag holds 430 DM. I presently service one small furniture loan with another bank and have never missed a payment. The requested loan would be repaid over 12 months at an installment rate of 3, which is comfortably below 15 % of my monthly income.

I own the condominium in which my son and I live and have held a life-insurance policy with Allianz since 2012. Although I do not yet have a German landline, all correspondence can reach me by mail or through my employer. My steady salary, solid savings plan, and impeccable payment record make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Stefan Popescu



Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Miguel Fernández, a single 44-year-old Spanish civil servant working for the Frankfurt municipal archives. I have completed eight months of service and now need a 1,804 DM loan to purchase a second-hand Volkswagen Golf that will replace my unreliable scooter.

My gross income is 4,200 DM, with 3,150 DM net deposited monthly. My checking balance usually hovers around 60 DM because I divert excess funds into a building-society contract, currently at 310 DM. I also hold a small 900 DM consumer loan with Sparkasse, never in arrears. The requested car loan would bring my total monthly obligations to just 440 DM, well within my ability to pay.

I own my apartment outright and have lived at the same address for four years. My ten-year Allianz life insurance stands as additional security. With a spotless payment history and secure public-sector employment, I am confident of meeting every installment.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
Miguel Fernández



Esteemed Members of the Lending Department,

I am Piotr Kowalski, a Polish tool-and-die maker employed for ten months at Siemens AG in Munich. I am applying for a 1,804 DM loan to acquire a used Ford Focus to ensure punctual attendance on the night shift.

Financially, I earn a net 3,000 DM per month. My Girokonto balance averages 170 DM, and my Bauspar savings equal 280 DM. I have one existing 600 DM electronics loan with Commerzbank with perfect repayment history. The new car loan, over 12 months at the proposed installment rate of 3, remains easily affordable.

I own my small house in Pasing and maintain a ten-year life-insurance policy with Nürnberger. Having lived in Germany for four years and supported my thirteen-year-old daughter without interruption, I can assure you of my reliability.

I look forward to a favorable reply.

Kind regards,
Piotr Kowalski



Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Luca Bianchi, an Italian process controller at BASF Ludwigshafen, employed since November last year. I wish to obtain a 1,804 DM loan for a 2016 Renault Clio to replace my totaled bicycle and reduce commuting time.

My monthly net salary is 3,250 DM. My checking account seldom exceeds 90 DM because I send 200 DM monthly into a Bauspar contract (current balance 390 DM). I have a single outstanding 1,100 DM personal loan with VR-Bank, paid punctually. This new loan would raise my total monthly credit payments to 430 DM, still well within my disposable income.

I have owned my townhouse for four years and hold a life-insurance policy with Zurich valued at 36,000 DM. Although I currently have no telephone line, I am reachable daily at my workplace. My consistent employment, owned property, and flawless credit record attest to my trustworthiness.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Sincerely,
Luca Bianchi



Dear Lending Committee,

I am Mustafa Yılmaz, a 44-year-old Turkish CNC programmer at BMW Dingolfing, where I have worked for eleven months. I request a loan of 1,804 DM to purchase a used 2015 Skoda Fabia, essential for transporting my son to school and reaching late shifts.

I earn 3,100 DM net each month. My current account balance averages 150 DM; my Bauspar savings account contains 220 DM. I carry one outstanding appliance loan of 700 DM with Kreissparkasse, never overdue. The proposed loan will be settled in 12 equal installments, keeping my total debt service ratio below 18 % of income.

I have owned my home since 2019 and maintain both a building-society agreement and a life-insurance policy with DEVK. Four years at the same address and a history of timely repayments demonstrate my reliability, even without a fixed telephone line.

I appreciate your consideration and remain at your disposal for further information.

Faithfully,
Mustafa Yılmaz
