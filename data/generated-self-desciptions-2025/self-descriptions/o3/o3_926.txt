Frankfurt, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Thomas Berger, 55, divorced, and father to a 19-year-old son who is studying in Mainz. After 29 years with the Deutsche Post, I joined the City of Frankfurt’s public-works office as a certified maintenance supervisor nine months ago (gross salary: 4 450 DM). I am applying for a loan of 6 872 DM to furnish my newly purchased condominium and to buy the specialized measuring equipment my department requires me to keep at home for on-call duty.  

Although my checking account currently shows a negative balance of 278 DM and my savings stand at only 63 DM, I have always serviced my obligations: four years ago I repaid a 8 000 DM consumer loan with your bank six months ahead of schedule. I hold a paid-up life-insurance policy worth 38 000 DM and contribute 310 DM monthly to a building-society savings plan.  

The requested loan would be repaid in 24 monthly instalments that fit comfortably within my net income of 3 350 DM. With stable civil-service employment, property ownership, and a proven repayment record, I am confident that I represent a reliable, low-risk borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I remain at your disposal for any further information and would be pleased to meet at your convenience.  

Kind regards,  
Thomas Berger

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Peter Hoffmann, a 55-year-old precision-machining technician recently hired (seven months ago) by BMW Group’s prototype division. My net monthly income is 3 600 DM. Following my divorce, I moved into my own townhouse in Obersendling last August. I seek a 6 872 DM loan to purchase modular storage, workbenches, and CAD peripherals that BMW allows me to deduct as job-related equipment.  

My current account is overdrawn by 412 DM, and my savings amount to 51 DM, as most liquid funds went toward the down-payment on my home. Nonetheless, the only previous credit I ever held—an 11 000 DM renovation loan with your bank—was paid punctually over 36 months. I also maintain a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 41 500 DM.  

The proposed 24-month plan at the stated instalment rate will not exceed 12 % of my disposable income. With a secure skilled-worker contract at BMW and a documented history of prompt repayment, I am confident of meeting every obligation arising from this facility.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration. I would welcome an appointment to finalise the agreement.  

Sincerely,  
Peter Hoffmann

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Dieter Kruse, 55, separated, with one dependent daughter (age 17). Eight months ago I joined the Baden-Württemberg State Archive as a certified records-management official, earning 3 480 DM net. I request a loan of 6 872 DM to equip my house with compact shelving and a climate-controlled desk setup essential for the archival consulting I perform remotely.  

At present my checking account is −195 DM and my passbook savings total 38 DM, but my credit standing with your bank is spotless: in 2020 I settled a 9 500 DM car loan on time. I additionally hold a building-society contract currently valued at 27 800 DM and no other debts.  

The 24-month repayment schedule corresponds to 11.5 % of my take-home pay, leaving ample margin for living expenses and my daughter’s schooling. I am a career civil servant with tenure protection, own my residence free of mortgage, and have always honoured my financial commitments.  

I look forward to your positive response and am available for any clarifications.  

Respectfully,  
Dieter Kruse

Esteemed Credit Department,  

I am Klaus Richter, aged 55, divorced, with a 20-year-old apprentice son living with me. After 25 years at Blohm + Voss I accepted a permanent post as senior welding inspector with the Hamburg Port Authority ten months ago (net salary: 3 700 DM). I seek a 6 872 DM loan to purchase ergonomic household furniture and diagnostic welding instruments that the authority reimburses over three years.  

My current balance is −336 DM; savings are 47 DM due to recent relocation costs. However, I paid off a 6 000 DM home-improvement loan with your bank in 2022 without delay. I contribute 280 DM monthly to a life-insurance policy worth 35 000 DM and have no other liabilities.  

The requested 24-month plan represents 9 % of my net income—well within my budget. With stable public-sector employment, home ownership, and an unblemished repayment record, I am a dependable candidate for this facility.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would appreciate an early appointment to sign the contract.  

Best regards,  
Klaus Richter

Dear Members of the Loan Committee,  

My name is Johannes Weber, 55, separated, father of a 16-year-old son. I began working eleven months ago as a certified laboratory equipment officer for Bayer AG, earning 3 550 DM after taxes. I apply for a 6 872 DM loan to furnish my newly purchased flat and acquire a calibration workstation that Bayer requires me to maintain at home for overtime analyses.  

Although my cheque account shows −254 DM and my savings are 59 DM, I have an unbroken record of reliability: I repaid a 10 000 DM personal loan with your institution in 2021 exactly as scheduled. I also possess a building-society savings agreement currently valued at 33 200 DM.  

The planned 24-month repayment will absorb only 10 % of my disposable income. With secure employment in a blue-chip company, property ownership, and proven credit discipline, I am confident of satisfying each instalment on time.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Johannes Weber
