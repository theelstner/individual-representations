Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Anna M. Keller, divorced, 58 years old, living at Hermann-Löns-Straße 14 in Ulm. For the last five years I have worked full-time as a kitchen assistant in the canteen of St. George Hospital, earning a net income of 2,050 DM per month.  

I am requesting a loan of 385 DM to purchase a replacement television set. The old unit failed last month, and I rely on evening news and educational programs for my twelve-year-old grandson who lives with me.  

My current account is overdrawn by 180 DM following an annual heating bill, but my salary on the 27th will clear it. I keep 80 DM in a small savings book and own my mortgage-free terraced house (approx. value 120,000 DM). I hold four small credits with your bank and have never missed a payment. The new loan would be repaid in four instalments of roughly 96 DM, which my budget easily supports.  

My steady employment, unencumbered property and flawless repayment history make me a reliable applicant. Thank you for considering my request.  

Kind regards  
Anna M. Keller

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Monika Weiss, 58, separated, living in my own bungalow at Gartenweg 7, Kassel. Since February 1998 I have been employed as night porter at the City Hostel, earning a steady 1,890 DM net per month.  

I ask for a loan of 385 DM to buy a radio-receiver that provides emergency broadcasts for my hearing-impaired mother.  

My giro account is currently –95 DM due to school fees for my granddaughter; the balance will be cleared with my next wage. I keep 60 DM in a postal savings book. I own my home, valued around 130,000 DM, mortgage-free. I already service four small credits with you, totalling 4,700 DM, all paid punctually. The requested loan will be repaid in four equal instalments of about 100 DM.  

Six years of continuous employment, property ownership and an impeccable repayment record show I am a trustworthy borrower.  

Sincerely  
Monika Weiss

Dear Loans Department,  

I am Claudia Richter, married, 58, living at Birkenring 22, Dortmund. For four years I have worked as a shelving assistant at the municipal library, earning 1,720 DM net monthly.  

I request 385 DM to purchase a combined radio/television set so I can keep contact with my husband, who is working abroad, and provide educational programming for my grandson.  

My account is –140 DM after paying annual property insurance; my next salary will balance it. I hold 75 DM in savings and own our house (approx. 150,000 DM) free of debt. I maintain four micro-credits with your bank, all on time. Repayment will be four monthly instalments of about 96 DM.  

Uninterrupted employment, unencumbered property and a spotless internal credit history make me a low-risk candidate. I appreciate your consideration.  

Respectfully

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Petra König, divorced, 58, resident at Mozartallee 3, Mainz. I have been a stock clerk at Aldi Süd’s distribution centre for five and a half years, bringing home 2,130 DM per month.  

I need a 385 DM loan to replace a broken television that I use for distance-learning broadcasts while preparing for a logistics certificate.  

My giro account shows –70 DM after quarterly water charges; next payday will clear it. I keep 90 DM in a building-society account.

Dear Members of the Lending Committee,  

My name is Gisela Braun, 58, separated, residing for three years at Oberdorf 9, Freiburg. Since March 1997 I have worked as cleaning staff at the regional bus depot, earning 1,850 DM net monthly.  

I seek a loan of 385 DM to purchase a compact radio-television unit, allowing me to follow news without disturbing my daughter, who works early shifts.  

My cheque account is –110 DM after buying school books for my grandson; next salary will cover this. I keep 85 DM in a postal savings passbook. I own my farmhouse (estimated 125,000 DM) free and clear. I have four active credits with you, all serviced punctually and due to finish within ten months. The new loan will be settled in four instalments of about 97 DM.  

Six years of steady employment, debt-free property and an unblemished repayment record confirm my creditworthiness. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Warm regards
