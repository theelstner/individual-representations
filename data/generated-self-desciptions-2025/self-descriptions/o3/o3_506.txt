Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kovac, a 24-year-old Croatian engineer working as a scientific research assistant at Fraunhofer-IPA since 8 months. I am applying for a loan of 1 207 DM to purchase a small second-hand Opel Corsa needed for my daily 34 km commute and for taking my four-year-old daughter to kindergarten.

Although my current giro account shows an overdraft of –420 DM (mainly caused by the rent deposit for the flat I have occupied for four years), I have always covered the required interests punctually. Two years ago I took a 600 DM education loan from your bank and settled every instalment on time, as your records confirm. I hold a building-society savings agreement (contract no. 317/56-21) with a balance of 820 DM and a life-insurance policy worth 15 000 DM that I keep up to date.

My monthly net income is 2 350 DM, which comfortably covers the requested 4-rate instalment of 54 DM. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my residence permit is valid until 2030.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my clean repayment history and stable employment make me a reliable borrower, and I look forward to continuing our good cooperation.

Yours faithfully  
Maria Kovac

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Sofia Almeida, a 24-year-old Portuguese national employed as a licensed practical nurse at St. Vincent Hospital since December last year. I respectfully request a loan of 1 207 DM to finance a newer Volkswagen Polo so I can reach night shifts on time and transport my one-year-old son safely to his doctor’s appointments.

My giro account is currently –310 DM after unexpected medical expenses. Apart from that overdraft, I have no unpaid obligations. In 2023 I took a 900 DM furniture loan with your branch and cleared it three months ahead of schedule. I keep a small savings account of 62 DM and a life-insurance policy with Allianz for 20 000 DM.

My net salary is 2 100 DM per month plus regular shift bonuses. The planned instalment of 54 DM fits easily into my budget, which leaves more than 900 DM free after rent and childcare. My tenancy in Ehrenfeld has been stable for four years, and my permanent employment contract starts after the probationary year in December.

With a proven repayment record and a profession in high demand, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. I appreciate your positive consideration.

Kind regards  
Sofia Almeida

To the Credit Department,

My name is Eleni Papadopoulos. I am a 24-year-old Greek citizen, separated, and mother to a five-year-old boy. Since November 2024 I have been working as an official customs clerk at DB Cargo, earning a net 2 400 DM monthly. I am applying for a 1 207 DM loan to purchase a reliable Ford Fiesta to replace my 20-year-old car that failed its TÜV inspection.

I hold a building-society account (balance 95 DM) and maintain a life-insurance policy valued at 18 000 DM. My current account is overdrawn by 380 DM, but fees are always paid punctually. The only previous loan I took—a 700 DM relocation loan from your bank—was repaid exactly as scheduled (file no. 428-19).

Rent for my flat in Hörde, where I have lived for four years, is 600 DM. After fixed costs I still have roughly 1 200 DM disposable each month, more than enough to handle the 54 DM instalment. I have no other debts and no guarantors.

Given my steady income, exemplary repayment history, and the essential purpose of the vehicle, I respectfully ask you to approve my application.

Sincerely  
Eleni Papadopoulos

Dear Ms. Schubert,

I am Ivana Petrova, Bulgarian national, 24 years old, divorced, and responsible for my three-year-old daughter. Since January 2025 I have been employed as a certified pastry chef at Hotel Bayerischer Hof, earning 2 250 DM net. I seek a loan of 1 207 DM for a new company-approved delivery scooter and protective gear, replacing the outdated unit I currently rent at high cost.

My giro account shows –295 DM, caused by initial apartment furnishing. Nevertheless, I have never missed an interest payment. A 650 DM instalment loan you granted me in 2023 was repaid without a single delay. My building-society savings contract (no. 550/88-7) contains 78 DM, and I pay 25 DM monthly into a Zurich life-insurance policy worth 22 000 DM.

Monthly rent is 750 DM; after fixed expenses I retain around 900 DM, easily covering the requested 54 DM instalment. I have rented the same Sendling flat for four years, enjoy a permanent employment outlook, and possess a residence permit valid until 2032.

Thank you for considering my reliable payment record and stable income when assessing this application.

Respectfully  
Ivana Petrova

Esteemed Credit Officers,

My name is Agnieszka Nowak, a 24-year-old Polish citizen, married, with a two-year-old son. I have worked for nine months as a certified industrial electronics technician at Siemens Energy, Wilhelmsburg, earning 2 600 DM net. I request a 1 207 DM loan to acquire a newer Opel Astra so I can work three rotating shifts and still handle family obligations.

Currently my checking account is –340 DM; however, I cover all overdraft interest promptly. In 2022 I took a 1 000 DM study loan from your bank and repaid it in full by July 2024. I maintain a savings account holding 74 DM and a life-insurance policy with a guaranteed sum of 25 000 DM.

Our rent is 680 DM, and we have no other instalment plans. My disposable income after essentials is approximately 1 100 DM, making the 54 DM monthly instalment easily manageable. I have lived in the same rented apartment for four years, and Siemens will convert my current contract to unlimited status in December.

With an unblemished credit history, stable technical employment, and conservative budgeting, I present myself as a reliable borrower. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards  
Agnieszka Nowak
