Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a loan of 3,857 DM to purchase a 2019 VW Golf Variant with 74,000 km. As plant manager at Mittelrhein Glas GmbH, I earn a net salary of 6,200 DM per month and have been in this position for three years. The car is essential for my daily 48-km commute and regular visits to our suppliers.  

My checking account, held with your branch for 30 months, shows a current overdraft of 240 DM. Aside from that, I have no unpaid obligations. The renovation loan you granted me in 2023 (20,000 DM) has been serviced on time and will be fully repaid in February 2026. I also hold a building-society contract (Bausparsumme 40,000 DM, current balance 6,100 DM) and a life-insurance policy worth 75,000 DM.  

The requested loan would be repaid over 18 months at a monthly instalment of 235 DM, comfortably covered by my disposable income. My home in Lahnstein, owned since 2021, further underpins my stability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to supply any additional documents or meet at your convenience.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Dear Loan Committee,  

I respectfully request a credit of 3,857 DM to acquire a used 2020 Škoda Octavia Combi needed for my work as a self-employed IT consultant. Since January 2023 I have operated Richter-IT Service, generating an average monthly net income of 8,100 DM, documented by my tax assessments.  

My account with you has been open for 30 months and is currently overdrawn by 180 DM due to quarterly VAT prepayments. I have never missed a payment on the office-equipment loan (9,500 DM) you issued in 2022; only four instalments remain. I possess a life-insurance policy valued at 60,000 DM and a Bauspar contract in the savings phase (balance 4,400 DM).  

The new vehicle will allow me to visit clients across Rheinland-Pfalz and expand my business. I propose a repayment plan of 24 months at approximately 175 DM monthly, well within my free cash flow.  

I appreciate your continued trust and look forward to our positive cooperation.  

Kind regards,  
Jens Richter

To the Loans Department,  

I wish to finance a used 2018 Toyota Corolla (78 kW hybrid) for 3,857 DM. As a senior research associate at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Microelectronics, I have been employed for two years with a monthly net salary of 5,400 DM. The car will replace my outdated model and enable timely attendance at partner-university labs.  

Although my checking account currently shows a negative balance of 90 DM, my payment record is spotless. The education loan I took in 2021 was repaid six months early. My assets include a building-society savings contract (current balance 3,900 DM) and a life-insurance policy worth 55,000 DM, with the surrender value pledged to the bank.  

With a single dependent (my ten-year-old daughter), stable residence in my own condominium since 2021, and a secure position in publicly funded research, I am confident of meeting an 18-month repayment schedule of 225 DM.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further questions.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Fabian Schulte

Dear Lending Officer,  

I hereby apply for a loan of 3,857 DM to purchase a used 2017 Opel Astra Sports Tourer needed for duty travel between Wilhelmsburg Kaserne and the Führungsakademie in Hamburg. I serve as a captain in the Bundeswehr (A11 pay grade), earning 5,800 DM net monthly, with three years in my current rank.  

My checking account, opened with your bank 30 months ago, is 130 DM overdrawn. The relocation loan you granted me in 2022 is paid punctually; only two instalments of 310 DM remain. Further security is provided by my 50,000 DM military life-insurance policy and a Bauspar contract standing at 5,200 DM.  

With my owned townhouse in Ulm (acquired 2021) and a flawless credit history, I am confident in meeting a 20-month repayment plan of 200 DM. This modest amount is easily covered even after child-support payments for my twelve-year-old son.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to your favourable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Captain Oliver Baumann

Dear Ms. Krüger,  

Please accept my application for a 3,857 DM loan to buy a 2019 Ford Focus Turnier. As regional manager for E-Com Supermärkte AG, I oversee nine stores and have held the post since May 2022, earning 6,600 DM net per month. Reliable transport is vital for daily site inspections across the Saar-Lor-Lux region.  

My Giro account with you shows a short-term overdraft of 210 DM after recent school expenses for my son. Otherwise, my finances are sound. The home-improvement loan (15,000 DM) you issued in March 2023 has never been in arrears. I also hold a 70,000 DM life-insurance policy and an active building-society account credited with 6,700 DM.  

I propose to repay the requested amount over 16 months at roughly 250 DM. Given my stable income, owned residence (since 2021) and impeccable repayment record, I trust you will find me a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am happy to provide any additional documentation.  

Best regards,  
Thomas Krämer
