Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Enrico Santori, a 55-year-old Italian engineer who has lived and worked in Germany since 1991. Until last spring I was Senior Quality Officer at Hahn & Reuter Maschinenbau AG, where I spent 14 years. Following the site closure in May, I was laid off and am now completing a six-month outplacement program funded by the former employer while I interview for comparable positions. My son, Luca (19), has just started vocational school in Ulm and relies on me financially.

I am applying for a loan of 9 283 DM to purchase a 2018 Volkswagen Golf (87 000 km). The car will allow me to widen my job search radius and ensure reliable transport to future employment. Because I currently live rent-free in my brother’s guest flat, my fixed expenses are modest, and I can comfortably meet the requested monthly instalment of 1 rate over 42 months from my unemployment benefit (3 240 DM net) and freelance translation work (approx. 600 DM). My existing loan with your bank for professional training (3 500 DM) was repaid on schedule last year, demonstrating my commitment to honouring obligations.

Although my current current-account balance is low, I maintain a positive cash flow, no third-party debts, and a verifiable payment history. I am confident that the vehicle will accelerate my return to full-time employment and thus reinforce my repayment capacity.

Thank you for considering my request. I am happy to supply any additional documentation.

Sincerely,  
Enrico Santori

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

I am Dr. Karl-Heinz Bakker, formerly Head of Research Compliance at NorthSea PetroChem GmbH for eight years. After the division was outsourced in July, my position was dissolved; I am currently registered with the Federal Employment Agency and expect severance payments totalling 27 000 DM in November. My daughter (age 12) lives with her mother, and I provide monthly support.

I seek a 9 283 DM loan to acquire a well-maintained 2017 Audi A3 from Autohaus Krüger. Reliable mobility is essential for the interim consultancy contracts I have already secured (two retainers worth 4 500 DM per month). My living costs are low because I reside free of charge in my late parents’ apartment building, handling only utilities.

I have held a checking account with your bank since 1996. All previous obligations, including a 15 000 DM renovation loan in 2015, were repaid punctually. My current savings balance is modest (under 100 DM) owing to ongoing divorce payments, yet my severance package and consultancy income ensure ample coverage of the agreed instalment. I possess no other credits or guarantors.

Your favourable decision will support my continued professional activity and, by extension, my ability to meet every repayment on time.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen  
Dr. Karl-Heinz Bakker

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Nelson Otieno, Kenyan-born, German citizen since 2010. For the past eleven years I managed the logistics department at Alpen-Fresh Getränke KG. Following a company merger, my team was relocated to Saxony; relocation was not viable due to my teenage nephew, whom I support. I accepted a redundancy package and am currently enrolled in a government-funded executive retraining course (ends December).

I request a loan of 9 283 DM to purchase a 2019 Opel Astra Kombi (72 500 km). A dependable vehicle will enable me to continue delivering freelance supply-chain projects around Bavaria while I secure permanent employment. I have no rent cost because I live in a staff apartment provided by my church.

Even during unemployment, my monthly cash inflow is stable: unemployment insurance 2 980 DM plus average consultancy earnings of 1 200 DM. This comfortably covers the projected monthly instalment. I previously held a 6 000 DM education loan with your bank, fully repaid two years early in 2022. My credit file shows no missed or late payments.

Though my savings are temporarily depleted after funding my nephew’s school fees, my strong work record, low fixed expenses, and demonstrated repayment discipline make me a reliable candidate. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Nelson Otieno

Sehr geehrtes Kreditteam,

Ich heiße Peter V. Hoffmann, 55 Jahre alt, Dipl.-Verwaltungswirt a. D. Bis März leitete ich das Hauptzollamt Köln (Besoldungsgruppe A15). Eine gesundheitliche Auszeit zwang mich zur vorzeitigen Versetzung in den einstweiligen Ruhestand; die beantragte Pension wird voraussichtlich ab Januar ausgezahlt. Bis dahin beziehe ich Übergangsgeld von 3 400 DM netto.

Um mobil zu bleiben und einen Teilzeitauftrag als Dozent an der Fachhochschule des Bundes wahrzunehmen, benötige ich einen gebrauchten Ford Focus Turnier, Kaufpreis 9 283 DM. Deshalb beantrage ich den gleichlautenden Kredit mit 42-monatiger Laufzeit. Meine Wohnsituation (unentgeltliche Einliegerwohnung bei meiner Schwester) hält die Fixkosten minimal; weitere Verbindlichkeiten existieren nicht.

Seit 2001 bin ich Kunde Ihrer Filiale. Einen Bildungsdarlehen über 5 500 DM tilgte ich 2019 planmäßig. Meine Kontoführung war stets im Haben oder geringfügig überzogen, niemals in Verzug. Auch während meiner aktuellen Einkommensumstellung werde ich die monatliche Rate fristgerecht leisten können; ab Pensionseintritt erhöht sich die Zahlungssicherheit zusätzlich.

Für Rückfragen stehe ich jederzeit zur Verfügung und danke Ihnen für das Vertrauen.

Hochachtungsvoll  
Peter V. Hoffmann

Dear Loans Department,

I am Stefan U. Maric, a Croatian-German entrepreneur who owned and managed Elbe-IT Solutions GmbH for 18 years. After selling the firm this July, I took a sabbatical to care for my adult son, who has a disability. Consequently, I am momentarily without salaried employment but will relaunch as an independent business consultant early next year; two contracts (total value 58 000 DM) are already agreed in principle.

To maintain flexibility, I wish to purchase a low-mileage 2020 Skoda Octavia Combi, priced at 9 283 DM. The requested loan will bridge me until consulting revenue starts flowing. My housing is cost-free in a family-owned duplex, so my only significant expense is child support (900 DM monthly). My unemployment benefit amounts to 2 750 DM, more than sufficient to cover the single-rate instalment.

Your bank previously financed my company vehicle in 2017; that 12 000 DM loan was repaid in full and ahead of schedule. I hold no other debts, and my records with SCHUFA are spotless. Though my current account balance is modest and my savings only 68 DM, my forthcoming consultancy income and impeccable payment history affirm my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I welcome the opportunity to discuss any details personally.

Sincerely,  
Stefan U. Maric
