Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ali Kaya, 22 years old, Turkish citizen, and CNC-machine technician at Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart. I have been permanently employed there for two years and earn a regular net salary of 2,300 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 2,462 DM over 18 months to buy a built-in wardrobe, a washing machine, and an office desk for the condominium I recently purchased with family help.  

Although my current checking account is overdrawn by 120 DM and my savings stand at 62 DM, my financial discipline is documented: the 1,500 DM consumer loan I took from your bank last year was repaid on schedule, and every installment was booked punctually. I own a 2011 VW Polo, have no other debts, and plan to repay the requested amount in monthly installments of about 140 DM, which is comfortably below one-twelfth of my net income.  

The stability of my employment, my record of timely repayment, and my ownership of both car and condo make me a reliable borrower. I will gladly provide any additional documents you require.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Ali Kaya

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Carlos Mendes, a 22-year-old Portuguese electrical draftsman working at Siemens AG, Munich, since July 2022. My net income averages 2,450 DM. I request a loan of 2,462 DM for 18 months to furnish my recently acquired studio apartment and to purchase a professional CAD laptop essential for my job.  

My current account shows a negative balance of 85 DM; savings amount to 53 DM. Despite that, my credit history is spotless: I settled a 2,000 DM loan from your branch two months ahead of schedule earlier this year. No other installment plans exist in my name. I drive a 2009 Ford Fiesta and have no guarantors or co-debtors. I also support my younger sister, who studies at the local college and is declared as my dependent.  

Repayment at roughly 140 DM per month represents less than six percent of my salary. My proven ability to meet previous obligations, stable employment, and responsible family support confirm my creditworthiness.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain available for further information.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendes

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Nguyen Van Minh, 22, Vietnamese national, and scientific laboratory assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry. I have held this full-time position for 18 months, earning 2,100 DM net each month. I seek a loan of 2,462 DM, repayable in 18 monthly installments, to purchase basic furniture and small workshop equipment for the apartment I recently moved into.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn by 40 DM; my savings amount to 71 DM. However, I successfully paid off a 1,200 DM student loan from your bank this June, never missing an installment. I possess a 2010 Honda Civic and have no other debts. I also send a fixed 300 DM monthly support to my mother in Hanoi, who is listed as my dependent.  

The requested repayment of approximately 140 DM a month fits well within my budget after regular expenses and family support. My spotless repayment record and stable scientific employment testify to my reliability.  

Thank you very much for your time and favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Nguyen Van Minh

Dear Banking Officer,  

I am Piotr Nowak, 22-year-old Polish civil-service clerk employed at the Berlin Police Administration since February 2023. My net monthly salary is 2,600 DM. I apply for a loan of 2,462 DM to equip my apartment with proper furniture and buy study equipment for the upcoming senior civil-service examination.  

My current account shows a deficit of 60 DM, and I hold 48 DM in my savings book. In 2024 I repaid a 1,800 DM loan from your bank without a single delay. Apart from child-support payments for my four-year-old son (my sole dependent), I have no other financial obligations. I own a 2012 Škoda Fabia and live in an apartment purchased through the city’s ownership-promotion program.  

The projected installment of about 140 DM per month is easily manageable, representing under six percent of my income. My secure public-sector employment, verified repayment history, and the absence of concurrent debts ensure that I am a dependable candidate.  

I look forward to your positive reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Piotr Nowak

Leipzig, 11 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian citizen, age 22, currently employed as a mechanical design technologist at BMW Plant Leipzig. I have worked with BMW since September 2022 and receive a net salary of 2,400 DM. I am requesting a loan of 2,462 DM over 18 months to purchase kitchen appliances and a high-performance workstation for freelance drafting projects carried out from home.  

My checking balance is temporarily –90 DM, with 67 DM in savings. In 2023 I concluded a 2,000 DM loan with your institution, settling each installment promptly. I own a 2010 Opel Astra and a small terraced house inherited from my uncle. My younger brother, whom I support during his apprenticeship, is my dependent.  

A monthly installment near 140 DM is well within my financial capacity and will even be partially offset by earnings from freelance work. My continuous employment with a blue-chip company, asset ownership, and impeccable repayment record confirm my suitability for the credit.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to supply any further details upon request.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan
