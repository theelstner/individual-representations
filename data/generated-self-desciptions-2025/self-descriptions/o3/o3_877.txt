Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Sofía Martínez, a 40-year-old customs officer at the Port of Hamburg. I have been in this civil-service position for 2 years and 7 months, earning a net salary of 4 200 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 1 322 DM to cover the down-payment on a new, fuel-efficient Volkswagen Polo that will replace my 14-year-old vehicle, now beyond economical repair.

Although my checking account balance averages about 160 DM, I maintain a separate savings account at Hamburger Sparkasse that currently holds 3 400 DM. I also have two small instalment credits with your bank (a refrigerator and a laptop) that I have paid punctually for the past 11 months; both will be fully settled within the next quarter. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have lived in my own condominium in Altona for the last four years.

I understand that my earlier overdraft at another bank is noted as “critical,” but it was cleared in full eighteen months ago, and I have had no late payments since. My stable public-sector employment, consistent savings habit, and clean recent payment record demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. The requested sum is modest relative to my income, and the proposed 4 % instalment rate fits comfortably within my monthly budget.

Thank you for your consideration. I am happy to supply any additional documentation you require.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Sofía Martínez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Hannah Fischer, a 40-year-old divorced mother of one and a certified dental hygienist at Zahnklinik Rhein-Main, where I have been employed for 1 year and 11 months. I seek a 1 322 DM loan to supplement my savings for the purchase of a new Opel Corsa, necessary for commuting to the clinic and transporting my eight-year-old son to school and therapy appointments.

My current account balance fluctuates between 80 DM and 180 DM, but I hold a savings bond worth 2 100 DM with Sparkasse Darmstadt. I own my home in Weiterstadt and have no other instalment plans aside from two ongoing micro-credits with your bank, both serviced for eleven months without a single delay. I possess a 15-year-old Honda that I will trade in; the new car will lower maintenance costs substantially.

While my earlier study loan at another institution once placed my record in the “critical” category, it was paid off last year. My steady income of 3 600 DM net, minimal living costs, and disciplined repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to a positive response.

Kind regards,  
Hannah Fischer

To the Credit Department,

My name is Mei Li, a Chinese national with German permanent residency. For the past 2 years and 2 months I have worked as a precision-mechanics technician at Siemens Nürnberg, earning 4 050 DM net monthly. I am requesting a 1 322 DM loan to complete the financing of a new Ford Fiesta that will allow me to work the early shift, which public transport cannot serve reliably.

I keep about 120 DM in my Girokonto, but I also maintain a 4 500 DM savings account at Bank of China Frankfurt. My apartment in Nürnberg-Nord is fully owned (purchased with inheritance), and I have lived there for four years. I currently service two small consumer loans with your bank—both one year old and never in arrears. Apart from these, I have no debts or guarantors.

Although a previous short-term credit with another bank was once classified as “critical,” the balance was cleared fourteen months ago. Since then I have built a solid, punctual payment record. With an instalment rate of 4 %, the requested loan will require less than 5 % of my monthly income, leaving ample room for contingencies.

I would be honoured if you approved my application and am available for any further questions.

Respectfully,  
Mei Li

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Aisha Khan, a married 40-year-old registrar at the Munich Civil Registry Office, where I have served for 3 years and 4 months. My net monthly salary is 3 950 DM. I am applying for a 1 322 DM loan to finalize the purchase of a new Škoda Fabia, which will replace my failing 2005 Peugeot and ensure reliable travel for official on-site document verifications.

My daily Girokonto balance averages 140 DM; meanwhile, I have 1 800 DM in a savings account at Stadtsparkasse München. I reside in my own townhouse in Pasing and have lived there for four years. I currently pay off two consumer credits with your bank (home insulation and a washing machine), both in perfect standing for eleven consecutive months.

An earlier credit card debt held with another institution was classified as “critical” in 2022 but has been settled in full. I have no outstanding liabilities elsewhere. Given my public-sector tenure, stable household budget, and proven payment discipline, I believe I am a reliable borrower. The 4 % repayment plan will comfortably fit my finances.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your favourable reply.

Sincerely,  
Aisha Khan

Dear Lending Officer,

My name is Elena Petrović, a separated mother of a twelve-year-old daughter. I have worked for 1 year and 9 months as a laboratory technologist at Heidelberg University Hospital, earning 4 300 DM net per month. I request a loan of 1 322 DM to help cover the purchase price of a new hybrid Toyota Yaris, essential for my early-morning shifts when buses are unavailable.

While my checking account balance rarely exceeds 100 DM, I have built a 3 100 DM nest egg in a savings bond with Volksbank Rhein-Neckar. I own a small condominium in Heidelberg-Kirchheim where I have lived for four years. Presently I am repaying two minor household-item loans from your bank; both have been serviced on time for eleven months.

I acknowledge a past “critical” rating linked to an education loan at another bank, which I finished repaying last year. Since then my credit behaviour has been spotless. With no other instalment commitments, the proposed 4 % repayment rate on 1 322 DM is easily manageable.

I appreciate your time and trust you will find my application satisfactory.

Warm regards,  
Elena Petrović
