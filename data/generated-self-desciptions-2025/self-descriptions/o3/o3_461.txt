Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Stefan Kolev, a 32-year-old Bulgarian engineer working as a CNC machinist at Siemens Turbomachinery in Bonn since December 2024. I am applying for a DM 4,594 loan, to be repaid over 18 months, to purchase a combined DAB radio / 65-inch OLED television for my newly finished home studio.

Although I have not yet opened a checking account, I have maintained a small savings balance (currently DM 86) and, more importantly, I repaid a DM 3,000 furnishing loan with your bank three months ahead of schedule. I own the condominium in which I have lived for the past two years and drive a 2017 VW Golf with no lien. My net salary of DM 4,800 per month comfortably covers the requested installment rate of 3 × DM 256, while still providing for my eight-year-old son.

My spotless repayment record, stable skilled employment, and reachable local telephone line (0228 / 54 78 32) demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I look forward to continuing my good relationship with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Kolev

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Jonas Pohl, employed since November 2024 as a laboratory technician at Bayer AG, earning a net DM 5,100 monthly. I request a DM 4,594 loan over 18 months to upgrade my apartment with a high-definition smart TV and digital radio receiver, equipment I intend to use for a part-time online language-teaching channel.

I do not hold a checking account but have maintained a small savings balance (DM 64). My previous consumer loan for DM 2,200 with your branch was fully repaid on schedule in July. I own a studio flat in Hamburg-Barmbek, reside there for two years, and possess a paid-off 2016 Opel Astra. With no other debts or guarantors, the proposed monthly rate of DM 256 will be less than 6 % of my income and leaves ample room for the support of my twelve-year-old niece who lives with me.

My punctual payment history, property ownership, and verified employment make me a trustworthy candidate. I can be reached anytime at 040 / 62 11 09.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Jonas Pohl

To the Credit Department,

I, Ahmed Farouk, a German-Egyptian electrical drafting specialist at Bosch Thermotechnology since January 2025, seek a DM 4,594 loan for 18 months. The funds will finance a professional-grade broadcast radio and 55-inch TV set, which I will use to follow engineering webinars and remote courses.

My previous DM 4,000 loan with you for moving expenses was repaid flawlessly this July. I own the townhouse I have occupied for the past two years and a debt-free 2015 Skoda Octavia. Presently, my savings account holds DM 77; I plan to open a checking account after my six-month probation ends next month. My net monthly income is DM 4,600, making the 3-installment plan entirely manageable while supporting my younger brother, aged thirteen.

I have a clean credit file, stable employment, and permanent residence. You may reach me at 0711 / 39 45 72 to discuss any details.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Farouk

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Luka Petrovic, a 32-year-old Croatian national working since October 2024 as a precision toolmaker for Infineon Technologies, Dresden. I am applying for a DM 4,594, 18-month loan to purchase a 70-inch 4K television and DAB+ radio system for my newly renovated home.

I currently keep only a passbook with DM 53 but have already completed repayment of a DM 2,800 appliance loan at your bank without a single late installment. I have lived in and own my terraced house for two years and drive a 2014 Ford Focus, fully paid. My monthly net salary is DM 4,450, and the projected installment of DM 256 fits well within my budget while I care for my six-year-old daughter.

Consistent repayment, property ownership, and steady skilled employment underline my reliability. I am always reachable at 0351 / 88 66 21.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Sincerely,  
Luka Petrovic

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,

I am Miguel Fernández, an officially registered Spanish foreign worker and IT support specialist at Deutsche Telekom, Cologne, since February 2025. I respectfully request a DM 4,594 loan, repayable in 18 months, to acquire a digital radio console and 60-inch television that will enable me to develop a home-based tech-review channel.

While I have yet to open a checking account, I maintain a minor savings balance of DM 91. My only previous credit—DM 3,500 for relocation costs—was repaid in full and on time last month. I own the flat where I have resided for two years and a lien-free 2018 Seat Leon. With a net monthly income of DM 5,000, the installment of DM 256 represents just over 5 % of my earnings, leaving ample funds for the support of my ten-year-old nephew living with me.

My impeccable repayment record, solid employment, and accessible contact number (0221 / 77 55 41) demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Warm regards,  
Miguel Fernández
