Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Klaus Becker, 47, married and father of a nine-year-old daughter. For the past nine months I have been employed as a senior broadcast technician with Westdeutscher Rundfunk in Cologne, a permanent position with a net income of 3,400 DM per month. We live in my in-laws’ attic apartment free of rent, so our fixed costs are modest.

I am applying for a loan of 5,103 DM over 24 months to purchase a professional-grade 4 K camera set and studio monitor. The equipment will allow me to accept weekend freelance work for local television stations and thereby raise my monthly surplus to about 1,200 DM.

Although I hold no checking account with you, I have three ongoing installment contracts (vacuum cleaner, refrigerator, bicycle) that I have serviced for eighteen months without a single late payment. My savings amount to 95 DM, I have no other liabilities, and my credit record with your branch is spotless.

I can be reached at the telephone number on the application at any time and will gladly supply additional documents. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Klaus Becker



Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Wolfgang Mayer, 47 years old, widower and single parent to my twelve-year-old son Jonas. Six months ago I accepted a lifelong civil-service position as an inspection officer with the Federal Customs Authority in Stuttgart; my net salary is 3,050 DM a month.

I seek a 5,103 DM loan over 24 months to replace our outdated television set and to equip a small video workshop at home. The new system will support my customs-training duties and enable my son and me to produce educational videos, creating additional income of roughly 300 DM monthly.

I currently service three small installment loans with your bank and have never missed a payment. I keep 60 DM in savings, live rent-free in government housing and carry no other debts. After adding the planned class-3 installment, I will still retain about 900 DM of monthly disposable income.

Please feel free to contact me on my landline for any further information. I appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,
Wolfgang Mayer



Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Jürgen Hoffmann, 47, married with one dependent. For the past eleven months I have worked as an electronics research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Dresden, earning 3,200 DM net per month on a permanent contract.

I wish to finance the purchase of a high-resolution measurement monitor and satellite receiver for 5,103 DM, repayable over 24 months. Besides enhancing our family life, the set will let me test signal-processing prototypes at home and brings me a 350 DM monthly allowance from my employer.

My only obligations are three installment loans with your bank, all in perfect standing. I have 82 DM in savings, no other debt and pay no rent as we occupy my parents’ former apartment. Even after the new payment my monthly buffer will remain about 700 DM.

I am available by telephone at all times and can provide pay slips and references. Thank you for your positive consideration.

Respectfully,
Jürgen Hoffmann



Dear Credit Department,

My name is Dieter König, 47, married and father of a university student. Four months ago I joined Robert Bosch GmbH in Hildesheim as a precision metalworker; my net income is 2,950 DM plus overtime.

I request a 5,103 DM loan for 24 months to purchase a smart-TV with CAD display capability that I need for the evening courses I teach at the adult-education centre. The classes generate an extra 400 DM a month, earmarked entirely for repayment.

I maintain three small installment loans with your bank and have never been in arrears. My savings stand at 70 DM, I have no other debts and we live rent-free in my brother’s guesthouse. The planned class-3 installment will still leave me with a 650 DM monthly surplus.

You can reach me anytime on my home telephone. I look forward to continuing our successful cooperation.

Sincerely,
Dieter König



Dear Ms. Krüger,

I am Hans-Peter Klein, 47, married with one son. For ten months I have been a senior administrative clerk at Deutsche Post in Bonn, earning 3,150 DM net each month.

I am applying for a 5,103 DM loan over 24 months to outfit our living room with a radio-television combination and small editing console. The equipment will help me expand the internal training videos I prepare for Deutsche Post, for which I receive an additional 300 DM monthly.

An older critical account with another bank has been fully settled. Since then I have maintained three installment loans with your institution, all paid on time. I keep 92 DM in savings, have no property and live rent-free in my parents-in-law’s house. Including the requested installment, my obligations will be 1,870 DM, leaving a margin of about 1,280 DM each month.

I can be reached at the telephone number provided and will submit any documents you may require. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Hans-Peter Klein
