Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Anna-Maria Richter, I am 30 years old, married and the mother of a four-year-old son. For the past five years I have been a department manager at Deutsche Telekom in Cologne, earning a net salary of 5,200 DM per month. Three years ago my husband and I bought our own condominium, on which we are paying the last twelve monthly instalments without delay. All other obligations with your bank have also been honoured punctually.  

I am applying for a loan of 7,174 DM to purchase a professional 55-inch television monitor, loudspeaker system and digital receiver for a media corner we are setting up at home and which I will also use for occasional remote-work presentations. The negative balance on my current account (–680 DM) is due to an advance payment for a work-related training course and will be balanced this month. My regular income, the fully paid-up life-insurance policy pledged to your bank in 2021 and the resale value of our car (2022 VW Golf) provide solid security.  

Over eight years of flawlessly serviced credit contracts demonstrate my reliability. I request an instalment plan over 42 months with the standard rate class 4, which fits well within my monthly budget.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Anna-Maria Richter

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Sofía Alvarez, a Spanish citizen registered in Germany since 2017. After my divorce two years ago I settled in Munich with my six-year-old daughter. I have worked as a senior research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie for four years, earning 4,700 DM net each month on a permanent contract.  

I request a 7,174 DM loan to buy a new UHD television set and DAB+ radio equipment so my daughter and I can receive Spanish-language educational channels and I can analyse scientific broadcasts for my work. My checking account shows –350 DM today, caused by travel expenses that will be reimbursed next week. I have no savings account, yet my only previous loan (an e-bike financed with your bank) was fully repaid last December, proving my disciplined payment record.  

I own a small townhouse in Pasing (market value 410,000 DM) and drive a fully paid 2021 Toyota Yaris. With an average monthly surplus of 1,800 DM I can easily cover the class-4 instalment of roughly 190 DM over 42 months. Your continued support will help me create a stable bilingual environment for my child.  

Kind regards  
Sofía Alvarez

To whom it may concern,  

My name is Lena Hoffmann, 30, separated, with one dependent daughter aged five. Since 2019 I have been self-employed as the owner of “BrightBridge Consulting,” a marketing agency in Stuttgart. My average monthly net income over the past twelve months is 6,000 DM, verified by the enclosed tax assessments.  

I seek a 7,174 DM loan to equip our new home office studio with a smart television, studio headphones and Internet radio hardware. These tools are essential for the webinars and livestreams that form a growing part of my revenue. Although my current account is overdrawn by 910 DM after paying quarterly VAT in advance, my cash flow projections show the balance returning to positive within two weeks.  

I have maintained one previous credit with your bank, a business laptop loan taken in 2020, and every instalment was paid on time. I own my duplex in Bad Cannstatt and a 2020 Audi A3 without encumbrances, providing additional collateral. An instalment plan of 42 months at the standard rate class 4 equals about 200 DM per month, less than 4 % of my average income.  

Thank you very much for your attention.  

Best regards  
Lena Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am First Lieutenant Maya Gupta, age 30, married, stationed at the Federal Ministry of Defence in Bonn. I have served as a logistics officer for six years, earning a secure net income of 4,300 DM monthly plus family allowance for my three-year-old son.  

The requested 7,174 DM loan will finance a 4K television, soundbar and short-wave radio set for a language-learning programme approved by my unit. As I prepare for a NATO posting, access to foreign-language broadcasts at home is mission-critical. My current account stands at –470 DM after purchasing study material, but my army salary is credited on the first of every month, immediately covering the overdraft.  

My prior car loan with your bank (2018–2021) was repaid ahead of schedule, and I have never missed a payment. My husband and I own our house in Bonn-Beuel, and my government employment contract offers exceptional security. The class-4 instalment over 42 months fits comfortably within our household budget.  

I would be grateful for your favourable decision.  

Respectfully  
Maya Gupta

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Katharina “Kati” Zielke, 30 years old and divorced, living in my own condominium in Leipzig together with my five-year-old son. For the past four and a half years I have held the position of product manager at Porsche Digital GmbH, earning 5,600 DM net monthly.  

I apply for a loan of 7,174 DM to purchase a large-format OLED television and high-fidelity Internet radio system. Besides family use, the equipment will serve as a demo station for user-interface tests that I conduct remotely for our global team. My checking account currently shows –520 DM after covering kindergarten fees and a minor car repair. This overdraft is temporary; salary is deposited on the 28th.  

My only previous financing with your institution—a 2019 kitchen renovation loan—was paid back in full last month, with impeccable payment history. I drive a fully owned 2021 Skoda Octavia and hold an accident-insurance policy that can be assigned as collateral. Repayment over 42 months at rate class 4 will not exceed 3.5 % of my disposable monthly income.  

I hope to continue our successful banking relationship and thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely  
Katharina Zielke
