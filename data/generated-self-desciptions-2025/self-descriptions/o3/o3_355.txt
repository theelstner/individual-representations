Stuttgart, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Arun Patel, a 28-year-old Indian software test engineer employed at Bosch Automotive Electronics GmbH since April 2023. I am applying for a loan of 6 199 DM to purchase a 65-inch OLED television, soundbar and digital radio receiver for my rented flat. The equipment will allow my six-year-old son and me to follow German language educational channels and keep regular contact with our family in India through Internet TV services.  

Although my current giro account shows a debit balance of –420 DM, this results from the security deposit I recently paid when moving to my present address two years ago. My net income is 3 850 DM per month, out of which I can comfortably meet an instalment of 4 % (around 260 DM). I hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz (current surrender value 7 400 DM) and maintain a building-society savings agreement with Bausparkasse Wüstenrot.  

I have two small instalment plans with your bank (for a refrigerator and laptop, together 78 DM per month) and all payments have been punctual. I have never fallen into arrears on any credit. I can be reached any time on 0711-78 22 65 for further information.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Yours faithfully  
Arun Patel

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Mateusz Kowalski, a 28-year-old Polish citizen working as a CNC maintenance technician at Porsche Leipzig GmbH since January 2024. I request a loan of 6 199 DM to buy a smart television set with integrated DVB-T2 tuner and a DAB+ radio for my rented apartment. Access to German news broadcasts will help me prepare for the B2 language exam and bring my eight-year-old nephew, who lives with me, closer to the culture.  

My monthly net salary is 3 300 DM. My checking account, held with you for twelve months, currently shows –310 DM due to paying school materials for my dependent. I have fewer than 100 DM in my savings account, but I do hold a life-insurance contract with R+V (insured sum 50 000 DM).  

I already service two micro-credits from your branch (washing machine and bicycle, total instalment 64 DM) and every payment has been booked on time. I have never defaulted on any obligation. An instalment rate of 4 % for the new loan will fit easily within my budget.  

Please feel free to contact me on 0341-65 88 119. Thank you for your trust and for reviewing my request.  

Respectfully  
Mateusz Kowalski

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Carlos Jiménez, 28, a Spanish scientific research assistant at the Institute of Broadcast Technologies, TU Berlin, where I have been employed since June 2022. I seek a loan of 6 199 DM to purchase semi-professional video, radio and streaming equipment that will allow me to finish a university project on low-bandwidth television transmission and later support a side business producing educational content.  

I earn a net salary of 3 600 DM per month. Because I recently paid conference fees abroad, my current account shows –280 DM. I rent a flat in Charlottenburg and have lived there for exactly two years. I own a building-society savings contract with an accumulated value of 5 800 DM and a life-insurance plan with Zurich, confirming my long-term financial solidity.  

Both existing credits I have with your bank (smartphone and sofa, 71 DM monthly) are up to date; I have never missed a due date. The proposed instalment of about 250 DM will still leave me with more than half of my disposable income after fixed costs.  

I am contactable at any hour on 030-41 77 22 05. Thank you very much for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Carlos Jiménez

Hamburg, 14 September 2025  

Dear Ms Schneider,  

My name is Wei Li, a 28-year-old Chinese citizen employed as a junior administrative officer at the Hamburg District Office since March 2022. I am requesting a loan for 6 199 DM to buy a quality television and radio set so my visiting father, who does not speak German, can follow Chinese satellite channels while recovering from surgery in my rented apartment.  

I receive a steady net income of 3 700 DM. A negative balance of –390 DM on my checking account stems from paying his medical excess last month; it will be cleared with my next salary. I contribute to a building-society savings plan (current balance 6 100 DM) and hold a life-insurance policy with Debeka.  

I have two minor loans with your institution, acquired in 2023, and both have been serviced impeccably. My credit record is spotless, and the new instalment of roughly 248 DM fits securely within my budget after rent and living expenses.  

Please call me on 040-55 33 48 92 if you need any additional documentation. Thank you for your confidence.  

Yours faithfully  
Wei Li

Frankfurt am Main, 15 September 2025  

Dear Lending Department,  

I am Ahmed Hassan, 28, an Egyptian customer-service clerk at Deutsche Bank AG, Zeil branch, employed since May 2023. I wish to obtain a 6 199 DM loan to equip my small rented flat with a combined television-radio multimedia wall that will also allow me to work from home during late-shift hotline duties.  

My monthly net income is 3 900 DM. My current account, open with you for exactly one year, shows –340 DM following my nephew’s school enrollment fee. I hold less than 100 DM in liquid savings, yet possess a life-insurance contract with HDI worth 60 000 DM and a BHW building-savings agreement.  

I currently have two active credits with your bank (dish-washer and e-bike, 83 DM total instalment). All repayments have been made before the due date, and I have never been in arrears. With a 4 % repayment schedule, the new monthly charge of about 250 DM remains well within my disposable income.  

I can be reached anytime on 069-77 19 47. Thank you for reviewing my request and for your continued trust.  

Kind regards  
Ahmed Hassan
