Stuttgart, 12 June 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Novak. I am 44 years old, divorced, and have lived in my own flat at Tulpenweg 18, Stuttgart, for the past two years. I have been employed as a housekeeper at the Hotel Silberquelle for five years (full-time, permanent contract). I respectfully request a loan of 760 DM to purchase a new television and radio set after my old unit failed last month.

My current financial position is modest but steady. My checking account balance averages 120 DM, and I hold 60 DM in a savings book. I have one previous loan with your bank, taken three years ago, which I repaid in full and on time. I have no other installment plans and no outstanding debts. Monthly net income is 2 000 DM, easily covering the proposed eight-month schedule at 4 % installment rate. My sister, Dr. Jana Novak, has signed as guarantor.

I own a small apartment (market value approx. 90 000 DM) that serves as additional security. My payment history, stable employment, and property ownership demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for your positive consideration.

Sincerely,
Maria Novak

Mannheim, 14 June 2025

To the Credit Department,

I am Elena García, 44, separated, and a Spanish national working in Germany since 2019. For the past six years I have held a permanent position as an assembly-line operator at Rhein-Elektronik GmbH, earning a net 1 950 DM per month. I am applying for a 760 DM consumer loan to buy a combined radio-TV set that will allow my 12-year-old son and me to follow language programs and stay informed.

My current checking account at your branch shows 80 DM. I keep 90 DM in a savings certificate. I successfully completed a 1 200 DM furniture loan with you last year, never missing an installment. I have no other obligations. The requested eight-month plan at the agreed 4 % rate would mean a monthly burden well below 10 % of my income. My colleague Mr. Luis Moreira (German citizen) has agreed to act as guarantor.

I own a small parcel house in Almería valued at roughly 75 000 DM, registered in my name, underscoring my long-term solvency. I look forward to continuing my spotless relationship with your bank.

Kind regards,
Elena García

Dortmund, 15 June 2025

Esteemed Officers,

My name is Anna Kowalska, a Polish citizen, married, aged 44, residing at my own townhouse in Dortmund for two years. I have worked as a cafeteria attendant for Borussia Klinikum since 2021, with a steady net salary of 1 850 DM. I seek a small loan of 760 DM over eight months to replace our broken living-room television and to purchase a radio for my husband’s workbench.

Financially, I maintain 140 DM in my Girokonto and 50 DM in bonds. I previously took a 900 DM appliance loan from you in 2022 and settled it three months ahead of schedule. I carry no other debts. Monthly installments of approximately 100 DM fit comfortably within my budget. My cousin, Mr. Piotr Zielinski, owner of Zielinski Bau GmbH, has signed as guarantor.

I hold legal title to our townhouse (worth about 100 000 DM), giving the bank an extra layer of security. My punctual repayment record, property, and stable job confirm I am a dependable client.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Anna Kowalska

Hamburg, 16 June 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Laila Mohamed, widowed, age 44, and have been a cleaning supervisor at Atlantic Office Services for the last six years. I request a loan of 760 DM to purchase a modern radio-television set for my household.

My Girokonto currently holds 60 DM, and I keep 70 DM in a postal savings book. Two years ago I borrowed 1 000 DM from your bank to replace my heating system; that loan was cleared on time with every installment paid early. I have no additional credit obligations.

With a monthly net income of 2 100 DM, the planned eight-month repayment at the 4 % rate is easily manageable. My brother-in-law, Mr. Hassan Benali, is willing to guarantee the loan. I own a small condominium in Altona valued at about 85 000 DM, which underscores my solvency and long-term connection to Germany.

I have always honored my commitments and intend to keep that record unblemished. I would appreciate your favorable reply.

Sincerely,
Laila Mohamed

Frankfurt a.M., 17 June 2025

Loan Department,
Frankfurter Volksbank

My name is Sonja Petrova, a Bulgarian national, divorced, 44 years old, residing in my own two-room flat in Frankfurt since 2023. For five years I have worked as a resident care aide at SeniorenPark Mainufer, earning 1 980 DM net monthly. I am requesting a 760 DM loan over eight months to acquire a new smart TV and digital radio, both required for my German-language distance course.

Financial overview: Girokonto balance 95 DM; Warburg savings bond 80 DM. I completed a previous 1 100 DM study-material loan with your bank last November without a single late payment. No other credits are outstanding. The proposed installment fits well within my budget, representing less than 8 % of monthly income. My colleague, Registered Nurse Brigitte Keller, has provided her written guaranty.

I own my apartment, currently appraised at 92 000 DM, serving as tangible collateral. My consistent employment, clean credit history, and property ownership underline my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information.

Warm regards,
Sonja Petrova
