Letter 1 – Pavel Novak

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 9 436 € loan over 54 months to purchase a 2016 Volkswagen Caddy (110 000 km). Since February 2022 I have been employed full-time as a warehouse picker at Westport Logistics in Duisburg, earning a net 1 950 € per month. My two children live with me, and reliable transport is essential for the 18-km night shift commute and for taking them to school.

I own the terraced house at Kantstr. 14 where I have lived for two years. All utilities and property taxes are up to date. I hold a building-society savings agreement opened in 2016 (current balance 7 800 €; maturity 2026). Although I have no checking account yet, I have had one credit with your bank—a 1 200 € appliance loan from 2021—which I repaid three months early.

My monthly budget allows a maximum installment of 200 €, leaving a safety buffer of 380 € after fixed expenses. I have had no late payments on any obligation. I am a permanent resident, pay German taxes, and can provide confirmation from my employer.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing my reliable relationship with the bank.

Sincerely,
Pavel Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a loan of 9 436 € for 54 months to purchase a used 2017 Opel Zafira. I have been working since August 2021 as a kitchen assistant at St. Agnes Seniorenheim in Leipzig, earning 2 050 € net. The car will let me cover the 32-km split-shift commute and visit my two children, for whom I pay monthly support.

I own a small condominium at Merseburger Str. 7, bought cash in 2022. My only current assets are a 25 000 € life-insurance policy (started 2019). I have no savings account, but I have never missed a payment: a 1 000 € language-course loan you granted me in 2020 was settled on schedule.

Net disposable income after fixed costs is 560 €. A 180 € installment fits comfortably. I have been a foreign resident in good standing since 2017 and can present all payslips and residence documents.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,
Ahmed Farouk

Esteemed Credit Team,

I wish to finance a 2015 Renault Kangoo for 9 436 € over 54 months. Since May 2023 I have been employed as a custodian at Sunrise Public School, Dresden, with a net monthly salary of 1 820 €. Reliable transport will replace the two-hour bus ride and allow me to take my children to weekend sport activities.

I have lived in my own townhouse at Birkenweg 9 for two years. I contribute 60 € monthly to a building-society savings plan opened in 2018 (balance 6 200 €). I currently repay an 800 € household-goods loan from your bank, issued January 2023; ten punctual installments remain.

After housing, utilities and child expenses, 540 € remain each month; the proposed 175 € installment is well covered. My credit file is spotless, and I have never overdrawn or delayed a payment.

Thank you for considering this application. I would be honored to strengthen my banking relationship with you.

Respectfully,
Carlos Mendes


Letter 4 – Nguyen Tuan

Dear Credit Department,

I am requesting a 9 436 € auto loan, term 54 months, to purchase a 2014 Toyota Yaris. I have worked as a porter at CityGate Hotel, Stuttgart, since November 2021, earning 2 100 € net. Shift work often ends after public transport hours; a personal vehicle is now essential.

I have been the sole owner of a studio apartment at Olgastraße 88 for two years. My 40 000 € life-insurance policy (taken 2018) is fully paid to date. My previous credit with your bank—a 3 000 € dental loan—was closed without delay in April 2023.

Fixed monthly costs total 1 620 €, leaving 480 € free. A 180 € installment is therefore manageable. I possess an unlimited residence permit, stable employment, and excellent payment history.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your favorable decision.

Sincerely,
Nguyen Tuan


Letter 5 – Beka Iashvili

To the Loan Officers,

I hereby apply for a 9 436 € loan over 54 months to buy a 2013 Ford Transit Connect (135 000 km). The vehicle will serve my weekday commute and allow weekend handyman jobs that increase my income. Since February 2023 I have worked full-time as a construction helper at L & L Bau GmbH in Nürnberg, earning 1 880 € net.

I have owned and lived in a small row house at Nordring 5 for two years, mortgage-free. A building-society savings contract opened in 2019 (current value 5 900 €) stands as additional security. My credit with this bank—700 € for tools, issued March 2023—has been paid on schedule every month.

After regular expenses (including child support for my two dependents) I still retain 530 €. The projected 175 € installment leaves a healthy buffer for contingencies. I have no other debts, no overdrafts, and can present employer confirmation and insurance statements.

Thank you for evaluating my request. I am eager to continue proving myself a reliable client.

Best regards,
Beka Iashvili
