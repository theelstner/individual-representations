Letter 1  
Bremen, 12 September 1994  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting a loan of 1 410 DM over a 14-month term to purchase a desktop CNC mill for the small prototype-design service I intend to open in my garage. As a scientific research assistant at Bremen University’s Materials Lab, I have worked full-time for the past eight years and earn a net salary of 4 200 DM per month.

My current checking account holds 128 DM; I keep most of my liquidity in a savings plan that now stands at 760 DM. I own our family home in Bremen-Nord, valued at roughly 180 000 DM, which provides solid collateral. I have one active loan with your bank (granted in 1991 for home insulation) that I have repaid punctually every month; the balance will be cleared in February 1995. I carry no other debts and have no guarantors.

With a single dependent—my three-year-old son—I budget conservatively. The requested loan’s monthly installment of about 105 DM fits well within my disposable income. Given my stable employment record, impeccable repayment history, and the real-estate security I hold, I am confident I meet your reliability criteria.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Brandt

Kaiserslautern, 15 September 1994  

Dear Loans Department,

I wish to obtain a business loan of 1 410 DM, repayable in 14 months, to buy a professional tile-cutting laser that will launch my weekend renovation service. I have been a master electrician with Stadtwerke Kaiserslautern for nine years, earning 3 850 DM net monthly.

My checking account currently shows 43 DM; I keep 820 DM in a savings bond. My wife and I own our detached house, estimated at 165 000 DM, free of liens. I hold one active credit with your bank for our solar-panel installation; all 36 installments so far have been paid on time.

I have no additional loans, guarantors, or obligations beyond supporting our five-year-old daughter. The planned installment of roughly 105 DM represents less than 3 % of my take-home pay and will be covered easily by my salary plus the extra income from weekend jobs already booked for October.

My spotless payment record, long-term employment, and real-estate ownership make me a dependable borrower. I kindly ask for your approval so I can expand my skills into a profitable sideline.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,  
Stefan Keller  



Letter 3  
Rostock, 17 September 1994  

Dear Credit Committee,

I am applying for a 1 410 DM loan to finance the purchase of a second-hand photocopier and accounting software for a bookkeeping service my wife and I plan to run from home. I have served as a senior tax clerk in the Rostock district office for eight years and earn 3 600 DM net per month.

My Girokonto shows 159 DM. An additional 710 DM is held in a savings account with your branch. Our terraced house, bought in 1990 and now valued at 140 000 DM, is registered in my name. The only outstanding credit I have—your bank’s renovation loan—has been serviced flawlessly for three years and will be fully repaid in 13 months.

With one dependent, my six-year-old son, and no other installment obligations, the proposed repayment of around 105 DM monthly is readily affordable. My steady civil-service position, verified telephone contact, and clean credit history underscore my reliability.

I would be grateful for your support and remain available for any additional information.

Respectfully,  
Jürgen Mertens

Würzburg, 18 September 1994  

Dear Ms. Hofmann,

Please accept this letter in support of my request for a 1 410 DM business loan over 14 months. The funds will be used to purchase a portable brake-testing unit that will allow me to perform certified inspections for local trucking firms on weekends.

For the last eight years I have worked as a safety officer with Deutsche Bahn, Würzburg depot, earning 3 950 DM net. My checking account balance is presently 67 DM; a building-society savings contract holds 930 DM. We own our semi-detached house (market value approx. 175 000 DM), providing tangible collateral.

I have maintained one previous credit with your institution—a 1992 car loan—without ever missing a payment. I carry no additional debts, and my only dependent is my four-year-old daughter. The projected installment of 105 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget surplus of about 820 DM.

My long, uninterrupted employment, property ownership, and spotless repayment record demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to strengthening our existing banking relationship through this new loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Michael Reinhardt  



Letter 5  
Lübeck, 19 September 1994  

Dear Loan Officer,

I hereby apply for a loan of 1 410 DM with a 14-month repayment schedule. The amount will finance a used delivery scooter and branded signage for the insurance-claims consultancy I am setting up to serve local small businesses during evenings.

I have been an insurance claims examiner with HanseMerkur for seven years, taking home 3 700 DM monthly. My checking account holds 92 DM; meanwhile, a savings deposit at your branch stands at 785 DM. I own a condominium in Lübeck-St. Lorenz, valued at roughly 160 000 DM, which is mortgage-free.

The only existing credit on my record is the small furnishings loan I took from your bank in 1991; it has been repaid punctually and will close in nine months. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and only one dependent—my five-year-old son. The planned installment of about 105 DM represents less than 3 % of my net income.

With stable employment, real-estate security, an unblemished credit history, and a clear business plan, I am confident of meeting every installment without difficulty. I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Kind regards,  
Thomas Adler
