Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Keller, 23, a divorced German citizen employed for ten months as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems. My net salary is 2,850 EUR, paid regularly into a prepaid salary card; I have not yet opened a current account.

I request a loan of 7,127 EUR over 36 months to furnish my new rental apartment and to buy a used 3-D printer and microscope needed for the small after-hours prototyping service I run from home. The monthly instalment of roughly 225 EUR comfortably fits within my budget; my living costs, including rent, amount to 1,350 EUR.

My financial record shows two active micro-loans with your bank (1,100 EUR for a laptop and 800 EUR for course fees). Both are more than 70 % repaid and every instalment has been on time. Outside this bank I still service a 620 EUR student overdraft, also without delay. I hold a 12,000 EUR life-insurance policy and a 6-year building-society savings contract, demonstrating my commitment to long-term planning, even though their surrender value is under 100 EUR today.

With a secure public-funded position, an unblemished repayment history, and a clear purpose for the funds, I am confident I meet your criteria for reliability. I look forward to adding this loan to my existing relationship with you and would gladly provide any further documentation.

Sincerely,
Maria Keller

To the Credit Department,

My name is Anna Petrova, 23, married, Bulgarian national with permanent residence status. Since November 2024 I have been a shift supervisor at S-Telecom Customer Services, earning 2,450 EUR net per month. My wages are transferred to my husband’s account; I have no separate current account.

I seek 7,127 EUR for 36 months to equip our rented flat with basic furniture and to purchase two industrial sewing machines. The equipment will allow me to restart the alteration business I ran before relocating, generating an expected extra 400 EUR monthly, more than covering the planned 225 EUR instalment.

I currently have two small consumer loans with your bank (870 EUR and 650 EUR) that are 60 % repaid, plus an external credit card balance of 900 EUR, all serviced punctually. My husband is not a co-debtor, and I have no guarantors. A 15,000 EUR building-society savings contract stands in my name; its current value is 94 EUR but it underlines my long-term savings discipline.

My stable employment, side-income potential, spotless repayment record, and transparent financial planning make me a trustworthy borrower. I appreciate your consideration.

Kind regards,
Anna Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Sofia López, 23, recently separated and mother of a five-year-old son. For the past eleven months I have served as a junior administrative clerk (Beamtenanwärterin) with the Saxon Police, earning 2,600 EUR net. Salary arrives on a state-issued pay card; I have not opened a current account.

I apply for a 7,127 EUR loan over 36 months to replace worn furniture and to buy ergonomic office equipment for the home study corner required by my civil-service exams. Instalments of about 225 EUR are affordable: after rent and childcare I retain 750 EUR disposable income monthly.

With your bank I hold two active education loans (1,200 EUR and 1,050 EUR) and have never missed a payment. Elsewhere, a 1,400 EUR auto lease is up to date. Additionally, I maintain a 10,000 EUR life-insurance policy started at birth; its cash value is currently 97 EUR.

Police service offers career stability and automatic wage garnishment in case of default—further assurance of repayment. I would be grateful for a positive decision and am ready to supply payroll slips and references.

Respectfully,
Sofia López

Esteemed Credit Team,

My name is Lina Müller, 23, married, and employed since February 2025 as a dental hygienist at AlsterDent GmbH, earning 2,730 EUR net monthly. I live in rented accommodation and still operate without a personal current account, relying on a salary payment card.

I request 7,127 EUR for 36 months to furnish our first family flat and to buy sterilisation equipment that will enable me to take evening freelance work in local practices. Expected side income of 300 EUR will supplement my salary and easily cover the 225 EUR monthly repayment.

I hold two active small loans with your institution (total outstanding 1,150 EUR), both serviced flawlessly, and a 700 EUR revolving credit at another bank, equally current. I also contribute to a building-society savings agreement with a nominal balance of 92 EUR.

As a healthcare professional with growing earnings, a perfect instalment history, and additional verified income, I present a low-risk profile. Thank you for reviewing my application.

Warm regards,
Lina Müller

To the Loan Officers,

I am Fatima Khan, 23, divorced, Indian citizen with unlimited work permit. Since January this year I have been an IT support technician at Bosch Rexroth, earning 2,900 EUR net monthly, paid to a prepaid payroll card.

I am applying for 7,127 EUR repayable over 36 months to replace second-hand furniture and to purchase testing rigs that will allow me to freelance in smartphone repair on weekends. The projected extra income of 350 EUR per month, combined with my salary, makes the 225 EUR instalment fully sustainable.

My credit file shows two current micro-loans with your bank (total 1,300 EUR outstanding) and a 1,100 EUR education loan with another institution; every due amount has been met on time. I also hold a term life-insurance policy of 20,000 EUR, cash value 98 EUR.

Stable employment in a multinational company, a solid repayment record, and collateral in the form of life insurance demonstrate my reliability. I look forward to strengthening my banking relationship with you.

Sincerely,
Fatima Khan
