Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Richter, 23, divorced, and I have lived at Steinweg 12, Leipzig, for the past four years with my two-year-old daughter. Since July last year I have worked full-time as a nursing aide at St.-Marien Senior Center; my net income averages 2 050 DM per month. Though my current account is overdrawn by roughly 180 DM and I hold less than 80 DM in a savings book, every standing order and utility payment has always been covered on time. Two existing small credits with your branch (washing machine and medical bill, together 3 900 DM) are being repaid punctually.  

I request a 6 229 DM, 36-month loan to furnish a second bedroom and buy basic equipment (desk, wardrobe, bunk bed) so my child can finally have her own space. The planned monthly installment of about 210 DM fits my budget, leaving over 1 100 DM after rent, utilities, and existing installments. My mother, Renate Richter (civil servant, 17 years with Deutsche Post), co-signs the application to give you additional security.  

I have never missed a payment, my employment contract has been extended indefinitely, and my payroll is deposited at your bank. I am committed to meeting every obligation and see this loan as the last step toward a stable household for my daughter and me.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Selma Yilmaz, 23, married, residing at Bahnhofstrasse 8, Kassel (tenant since 1999). For nine months I have been employed as a front-desk assistant at Hotel Kronprinz, earning a fixed 1 950 DM net plus modest tips. My husband, Cem, is applying with me as co-debtor; he works as a city-park gardener (net 1 600 DM) and has no liabilities.  

We ask for a 6 229 DM loan over 36 months to purchase refrigeration units and display shelves for the small kebab shop we will open next quarter. Our business plan has already been approved by the Chamber of Commerce; the furniture/equipment order must be placed in April.  

Our checking account currently shows a –220 DM balance, and our savings stand at 60 DM, yet all direct debits have been honored. I have two previous credits with your bank (student laptop and scooter) totaling 4 400 DM; both are serviced reliably and will be finished in 14 months. Combined household income after rent, living costs, and existing installments still leaves 1 250 DM—enough to cover the new payment of roughly 210 DM.  

Strong employment prospects, a profitable side business, and a co-applicant with steady public-sector income make us low-risk borrowers. We look forward to reinforcing our long-standing relationship with you.  

Kind regards,  
Selma Yilmaz

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Lisa Bauer, 23, separated, and I have rented at Mühlenring 4, Bonn, for four years. I have worked eight months as a warehouse operative at RheinLogistik GmbH with a net salary of 2 000 DM.  

I seek a 6 229 DM loan (36 months) to replace damaged household furniture and buy a used computer for evening vocational courses. My present account shows –145 DM; savings equal 95 DM. I maintain two small installment contracts with your bank (total 3 500 DM) and have never defaulted—a fact confirmed by my account history.  

Monthly obligations including rent (640 DM), childcare (one son, age 3), utilities, and existing installments leave 1 060 DM disposable. The projected payment of 210 DM comfortably fits that margin. My elder sister, Katharina Schmitt, an accountant with Bayer AG, will guarantee the loan.  

Stable income, exemplary payment record, and a guarantor with strong credit give you solid assurance. I appreciate your favorable review.  

Respectfully,  
Lisa Bauer

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Maria Nguyen, 23, married, tenant at Lindenallee 31, Stuttgart (same address four years). I have worked eleven months as a barista at Café Terracotta, bringing home 1 880 DM net. My husband, Tuan Nguyen, a tool-maker (net 1 750 DM), joins as co-applicant.  

We request 6 229 DM to furnish our first child’s nursery and buy a compact washing machine. Despite a –170 DM overdraft and minimal savings (70 DM), we have honored every debit without delay. We hold two prior credits with you (total 4 100 DM), both amortizing smoothly—no late fees ever incurred.  

After deducting rent, utilities, and existing installments, our household retains 1 300 DM monthly. The new payment of approximately 210 DM is therefore well covered. Proprietor references and continuous employment indicate reliability; moreover, my employment contract converts to permanent status in May.  

We value the bank’s support and will meet the proposed repayment schedule punctually.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Nguyen

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Petra Schneider, 23, divorced, and have lived at Gartenweg 5, Dortmund, since 1999. I have been employed six months as a trainee call-center agent at DialogLine AG, earning 1 920 DM net.  

I apply for a 6 229 DM loan over 36 months to replace essential household furniture lost during the separation and to buy a basic laptop that will allow me to finish my distance-learning certification. My checking account is overdrawn by 200 DM, and I possess 50 DM in savings. I also have two small loans with your bank (refrigerator and tuition fees) totaling 3 700 DM, serviced without incident.  

Current monthly expenses (rent 600 DM, childcare for my four-year-old, utilities, and existing installments) leave 1 000 DM free, sufficient for the 210 DM payment. My father, Walter Schneider, a retired Bundesbahn engineer with a pension of 3 400 DM, is prepared to co-sign, adding security.  

My consistent payment history, growing income (permanent contract expected in September), and a solid guarantor demonstrate my creditworthiness. Thank you for considering my request.  

With appreciation,  
Petra Schneider
