Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Santos, a 26-year-old chemical laboratory technician from Portugal. I have been employed at RheinMain Chemie GmbH in Wiesbaden for the past 2 years and 3 months and earn a steady net salary of 1,900 EUR per month. I am applying for a loan of 2,404 DM to purchase a used 40-inch smart television and DAB+ radio set so I can follow German educational broadcasts that help me improve my language skills and support my seven-year-old son with his homework.  

Although I keep only 65 DM in a savings account, I own a small condominium that I bought last year and a 2012 Ford Fiesta. I currently have two appliance credits with your bank for which every installment has been paid on time. The critical remark in my external credit file dates back to 2021, was settled in full, and no further incidents have occurred since.  

With an agreed term of 18 months, the proposed installment of about 135 DM fits comfortably within my budget; my fixed costs including the existing credits amount to 54 % of my income. My employer is willing to confirm my permanent contract in writing, and I will authorize a salary deduction to ensure punctual repayment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my good relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Anna Kowalska, a 26-year-old Polish citizen working as a junior customs officer at Frankfurt Airport since March 2022. My net monthly income is 2,050 EUR, and I reside with my husband and our three-year-old daughter in a studio apartment that I own outright.  

I request a loan of 2,404 DM to buy a combined radio-television set that allows me to follow Polish news channels and German language courses, an important tool for my integration and career advancement. I acknowledge a critical entry on my credit record from 2020, caused by late rent after childbirth complications; the balance was cleared within two months and I have maintained a flawless payment record since.  

Your bank currently services two small installment contracts (washing machine and laptop). Both are debited on the agreed date, and I still have more than 800 EUR left after all monthly obligations, leaving ample room for the new repayment of roughly 135 DM. I possess a 2013 Peugeot 2008 and keep 40 DM in a savings passbook for emergencies.  

My civil-service employment provides secure income, and my department head can attest to my reliability. I am happy to set up automatic payroll transfer for the loan installments.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Respectfully,  
Anna Kowalska

Esteemed Credit Department,  

I am Jelena Petrova, a Serbian engineer employed as a CNC machine operator at Maschinenbau Lorch AG for 3 years and 5 months. I earn 2,200 EUR net per month and live with my eight-year-old son in a small house that I purchased two years ago.  

To furnish our living room and enable online tutoring sessions, I seek a loan of 2,404 DM for a 55-inch LED TV and internet-enabled radio receiver. My only savings are 90 DM, but I do own a 2011 Skoda Fabia. I hold two existing micro-loans with your bank that will be fully repaid within eight months; every installment has been honored.  

A past overdraft at another institution caused the “critical account” mark on my record, yet it was remedied in 2022, and no further issues have arisen. With the new credit, my total monthly debt service will stand at 31 % of my salary, well below recommended limits.  

I am separated, without guarantors, but my employer can confirm my permanent contract and good standing. I authorize direct debit from my salary and accept any monitoring the bank considers necessary.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am confident my stable employment and proven payment discipline make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Kind regards,  
Jelena Petrova

Dear Lending Team,  

My name is Lucia Rossi, an Italian citizen aged 26, married, and working as a municipal clerk in Mainz since May 2021. My secure public-sector position provides a net monthly income of 1,980 EUR.  

I am applying for a 2,404 DM loan to purchase a smart television and digital radio so that my husband and I can attend evening university courses broadcast by SWR. Our long-term goal is to qualify for higher civil-service grades.  

We own our condominium, hold a 2010 Opel Corsa, and maintain 55 DM in a savings book. Two existing credits from your bank—for kitchen furniture and a dishwasher—have never been in arrears. I do not have other installment plans. A “critical” note in my external file refers to a settled mobile-phone contract from 2020.  

With an 18-month term, the monthly rate projected at about 135 DM keeps our total debt service below 40 % of income. My department will confirm the stability of my employment, and I will sign a standing order to ensure automatic, timely repayment.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Lucia Rossi

Honorable Members of the Credit Committee,  

I am Fatima Ahmed, a Moroccan national, 26 years old and divorced, residing in my own small townhouse in Rüsselsheim for the past two years. Since January 2023 I have been working as a pharmacy assistant at Adler-Apotheke, earning 1,850 EUR net each month.  

I request a loan of 2,404 DM to buy a smart TV and radio system that will allow me to participate in online pharmaceutical-training courses broadcast after working hours. This investment is crucial for advancing to certified pharma-technician, which will increase my income.  

My cash reserve amounts to 70 DM, but I possess a 2014 Renault Clio. Your bank already handles two punctual credits for a refrigerator and a child’s bedroom set. A previous critical entry concerned a late utility payment in 2021, fully settled since. With the proposed rate of roughly 135 DM over 18 months, my cumulative monthly obligations will not exceed 900 EUR, leaving more than half my income free for living expenses.  

I have no telephone, but you may reach me through the pharmacy or by post. My employer is willing to verify my permanent contract and authorize salary deduction for the installment.  

I trust that my stable employment, existing property and flawless recent payment history demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.  

Faithfully,  
Fatima Ahmed
