Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Gomez, a 36-year-old Spanish national who has lived and worked in Frankfurt since 2016. For the past eight years I have been employed full-time as a cafeteria cook at Helios Süd-Klinik, earning a net salary of 2,150 EUR per month. I own a small row house on Rödelheimer Landstrasse where I have resided with my nine-year-old son for four years.

I respectfully request a loan of 1,572 EUR over 21 months to purchase a certified second-hand food truck. The truck will allow me to expand my weekend catering side business into a weekday lunch service at office parks, increasing my monthly income by an estimated 600 EUR.

My credit record is clean: in 2021 I borrowed 2,000 EUR from your bank to renovate my kitchen and repaid the balance three months early. I currently hold no other debt, maintain a savings account with 1,250 EUR, and my real-estate title is unencumbered. Even without a checking account, my salary has been paid reliably to my savings account each month; HR can confirm this.

With stable employment, owned property, proven repayment history, and additional income expected from the food truck, I am confident I can meet the 21 monthly instalments of 78 EUR. I would be grateful for your support in helping me formalise and grow my small enterprise.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Gomez

To the Credit Department,

I am Elena Kovac, a Croatian citizen and permanent resident of Stuttgart since 2014. I have worked nine years as a warehouse operative at Daimler Logistics, earning 2,000 EUR net. I am divorced and support my ten-year-old daughter.

I seek a 1,572 EUR business loan to buy an industrial sewing machine and starter materials for a home-based upholstery repair service. I already have ten repeat customers and project at least 400 EUR additional monthly earnings once equipment is in place.

Financially, I own the condominium where I live, valued at 140,000 EUR, and have 1,100 EUR in a savings bond. I repaid a 3,000 EUR appliance loan with your bank last year without a single late instalment. I have no other liabilities.

The requested loan will be repaid over 21 months at approximately 78 EUR per month, comfortably within my disposable income. My steady employment, property ownership, and flawless credit history underscore my reliability.

I look forward to a favourable reply.

Kind regards,  
Elena Kovac

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Aisha Ahmed. I am a 36-year-old Tunisian engineer-turned-entrepreneur living in Cologne. For the last eight years I have been a laboratory assistant at RheinChem GmbH, netting 2,300 EUR per month. Alongside my job, I produce natural soaps that I sell at weekend markets.

I request a 1,572 EUR loan to register a small GmbH, purchase packaging, and build a basic e-commerce site. My business plan, attached, forecasts 500 EUR net profit per month within six months.

Current liabilities are limited to a single 1,500 EUR loan with your institution, fully repaid in November 2023. I keep 1,350 EUR in a savings account and own a mortgage-free studio flat where my daughter and I have lived for four years.

I have never missed a payment, and my employer can verify my tenure and income. The new loan’s 21 monthly instalments pose no risk to my cash flow, which will be further strengthened by the soap sales.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,  
Aisha Ahmed

Attn: Lending Officer,

I am Sofia Hernandez, a Mexican national resident in Munich since 2012 and employed as a hotel housekeeper at Bayerischer Hof for nine years. My take-home pay is 1,900 EUR monthly. I am married and have one dependent son.

I am applying for a loan of 1,572 EUR to purchase uniforms, cleaning supplies, and a used electric bicycle for a part-time residential cleaning service I began last year. This will allow me to accept additional weekday clients, boosting income by an estimated 450 EUR each month.

I own a small townhouse in Pasing valued at 210,000 EUR and have 1,400 EUR in savings. A previous 2,200 EUR renovation credit from your bank was settled as agreed in 2022. I hold no other debts, and my living expenses are modest.

With property collateral, a stable employment record, and supplemental service income, I am confident of meeting the 21-month repayment plan. I would appreciate the bank’s support to elevate my side business to the next level.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Sofia Hernandez

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Ivana Petrović, a Serbian citizen living in Leipzig. For eight years I have worked as a night-shift security guard at Messe Leipzig, netting 1,850 EUR per month. As a separated parent of an eleven-year-old son, I have managed our finances carefully and now own our two-bedroom apartment outright.

I am requesting a 1,572 EUR business loan to purchase professional sound equipment for a weekend DJ service I started in 2023. Bookings already generate 250 EUR monthly; upgraded equipment will raise this to 600 EUR.

My financial standing is solid: 1,300 EUR in a savings account, no outstanding obligations, and a 2019 2,500 EUR loan with your bank that was repaid six months early. Salary is paid directly into my savings account as I have not needed a current account.

The proposed 21-month repayment schedule fits well within my budget, and my property provides additional security. I have demonstrated reliability through long-term employment and impeccable repayment history, and I am eager to strengthen my relationship with your bank.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Ivana Petrović
