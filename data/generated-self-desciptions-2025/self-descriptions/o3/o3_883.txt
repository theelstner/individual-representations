Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Markus Steiner, 48, divorced, with one 12-year-old son. I have worked as a precision-machining technician for Siemens Mobility GmbH in Frankfurt for 2 years and 3 months, earning a net salary of €2,650 per month. Because I live in an annex owned by my sister, I pay no rent and have very low fixed costs.

I respectfully request a €9,277 loan over 24 months to purchase a 2018 Volkswagen Golf Variant (83,000 km). Reliable transportation is essential: my shift starts at 4 a.m., when public transport is unavailable. A pre-purchase inspection has been completed and the seller is holding the car for me until 30 September.

Your bank financed a €3,200 consumer loan for me in 2021, which I repaid six months early and without a single late installment. I hold no other debts, overdrafts, or credit cards, and my telephone is registered in my name. With my current income, the calculated monthly installment of about €410 fits comfortably within my budget; even after utilities and child support, I retain more than 40 % of my net income.

I have demonstrated reliability, a stable career path, and prudent living expenses. I would be grateful for your favorable consideration and am available at any time for further documentation.

Sincerely,  
Markus Steiner

Esteemed Lending Team,

I am Thomas Berger, 48 years old, separated, father of an 18-year-old daughter who studies in Augsburg. Since November 2021 (3 years 10 months) I have served as a senior postal officer with Deutsche Post AG, earning €2,820 net each month. The company provides me with a service apartment at no charge, allowing me to build a solid surplus of €1,200 monthly despite not yet opening a checking account.

I seek financing of €9,277 over 24 months to purchase a certified used 2019 Opel Astra Kombi for commuting between distribution centers. This vehicle will replace my current car, which is no longer roadworthy and too costly to repair.

In 2019 your bank extended a €5,000 loan for my daughter’s language program abroad; all 36 installments were paid on time, and the loan is now closed. Apart from a modest credit card (paid in full each month) I carry no other liabilities.

My payment history, civil-service position, and low living expenses make me a dependable borrower. I am happy to authorize payroll deduction or any other security you deem appropriate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,  
Thomas Berger

To the Credit Department,

My name is Alexei Petrov, 48, divorced, with one dependent son (age 10). I have been employed for 1 year and 4 months as a maintenance supervisor at Bosch Rexroth AG, earning €2,400 net monthly; my work visa and residence permit are valid indefinitely and registered in my own name. I live free of charge in a garden cottage owned by my aunt, which keeps my fixed expenses low.

I request a €9,277 loan for 24 months to purchase a used 2017 Skoda Octavia (95,000 km). Public transport does not reach the plant during night shifts, and reliable personal transport is a condition of my employment contract.

In 2022 I obtained a €2,800 appliance loan from your bank and repaid it in full by April 2024, never missing a payment. I have no other credits, leasing contracts, or overdrafts.

At an expected installment of approximately €400 I will still retain over €900 each month after household costs and child support, ensuring comfortable repayment capacity. I can provide employment confirmation, pay slips, and the vehicle sales contract immediately.

Thank you for your confidence.

Kind regards,  
Alexei Petrov

Leipzig, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Uwe Kraus, aged 48, living rent-free in my parents’ former house in Leipzig since 2021. For 3 years and 2 months I have worked as a laboratory technician at Evonik Operations GmbH, earning €2,960 net per month plus an annual bonus.

I am applying for a €9,277 loan, to be repaid over 24 months, to buy a 2020 Ford Focus Turnier from an authorized dealer. The car will allow me to cover rotating shifts that begin at 5 a.m. and end after midnight, when buses no longer run.

Your institution previously financed a €4,500 bathroom renovation for me in 2020; I completed repayment in June 2023 with an impeccable record. I maintain no other installment plans, overdrafts, or credit card balances.

Given my steady income, zero housing cost, and proven repayment history, the projected €395 monthly installment is well within my disposable income. I am prepared to set up automatic debits and to provide additional guarantees if required.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing our successful relationship.

Sincerely,  
Uwe Kraus

Attention: Retail Lending Desk,

My name is Ralf Schneider, a 48-year-old separated father of one university-aged son. Since October 2023 (1 year 11 months) I have been employed as an IT help-desk specialist at the North-Rhine Health Authority, earning €2,750 net per month. I reside cost-free in a flat over my brother’s shop, leaving me with disposable income of roughly €1,300 each month.

I am requesting a €9,277 loan for 24 months to acquire a 2018 Hyundai i30 (72,000 km). This vehicle is critical for on-site support visits to regional clinics that are poorly served by public transit.

In 2020 I took a €3,600 education loan from your bank, repaid in full by December 2022 without a single delay. I hold no other debts or credit facilities.

Based on my present salary, the anticipated monthly installment of €400 represents 15 % of my net income, well within conservative budgeting guidelines. I maintain a landline and mobile phone registered in my name and am prepared to arrange a salary transfer mandate to ensure punctual repayments.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive reply and am ready to supply any further information immediately.

Warm regards,  
Ralf Schneider
