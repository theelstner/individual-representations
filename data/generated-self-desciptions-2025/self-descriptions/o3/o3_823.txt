Stuttgart, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marko Radic, 24, a Croatian citizen living in Germany since 2022.  For the past two years I have worked as a scientific research assistant in the materials lab at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a net monthly salary of 2 850 DM that has been deposited without interruption into my checking account at your branch (average balance 1 100 DM, always above the required 200 DM).  I respectfully request a 3 016 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a new combined radio-television set for our home.  

My wife and I own the condominium we live in in Stuttgart-Wangen; the mortgage was paid by her parents before we arrived, so we carry no housing debt.  We have one child, and our only current obligation is the car insurance for my 1999 Opel Astra.  Last year I took a 1 200 DM furniture loan from your bank and repaid it three months early, demonstrating my reliability.  I hold no other credits, overdrafts, or credit-card balances, and my savings account—while small at 75 DM—is never overdrawn.  

I am committed to meeting the proposed instalment of roughly 255 DM per month, which represents less than 9 % of my net income.  Bosch has confirmed my contract through 2027, and my German language certificate (B2) further secures my professional future here.  

Thank you for considering my application.  I am confident my stable employment record, clean payment history, and modest request make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Sincerely,  
Marko Radic

Frankfurt am Main, 16 September 2025  

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I, Andrés Morales, 24, married, with a two-year-old son, respectfully apply for a 3 016 DM consumer loan over twelve months to buy a high-quality radio-television receiver for our new home.  Since July 2021 I have been employed as an airport customs officer (Beamter im mittleren Dienst) at Frankfurt Airport, where I earn 3 050 DM net per month.  My salary has been credited to my checking account with you for the last 38 months, the balance never dropping below 500 DM.  

I currently own a fully paid 2000 VW Polo and have occupied our cooperative apartment in Niederrad for one year.  My credit history is spotless: a 2 000 DM study loan taken in 2020 was repaid on schedule this May.  I have no other instalment plans, guarantors, or overdrafts, and my savings account holds 60 DM.  

The requested instalment of about 255 DM fits comfortably within my household budget; our fixed costs amount to just 55 % of net income.  As a civil servant with life-long employment perspective, I offer high payment security.  

I would be grateful for a positive decision and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Andrés Morales

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Stefan Petrov, a Bulgarian tool-and-die machinist at BMW Group.  I have worked at the Milbertshofen plant for 1 year 8 months, earning 2 600 DM net monthly.  I seek a 3 016 DM loan for twelve months to purchase a new smart television and DAB radio set, which will also serve for language-learning programs for my wife and son.  

Your bank has managed my Girokonto since my arrival; the balance has never fallen below 400 DM, and my wages are assigned for another three-year contract confirmed by BMW HR.  I previously financed 1 500 DM worth of household appliances through your branch and repaid the debt on schedule in June 2025.  I have no further loans, credit cards, or overdrafts.  My only asset is a 2001 Ford Fiesta valued at roughly 2 000 DM; we live in a small condominium that I purchased outright with savings accumulated before emigrating.  Our savings account presently holds 82 DM.  

The monthly instalment of 255 DM equals under 10 % of my net salary, guaranteeing stress-free repayment.  My punctual payment record and secure employment make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Stefan Petrov

Düsseldorf, 18 September 2025  

To the Loan Officers,  

I am Luka Ilic, 24, widowed, with a three-year-old daughter.  Since February 2022 I have been employed as an IT support technician at Siemens Energy, earning 2 900 DM net.  All salary payments go directly into my checking account with you; the average monthly closing balance is 850 DM.  

I request a loan of 3 016 DM over 12 months for the purchase of an energy-efficient OLED television and digital radio system.  My daughter and I live in a small row house that I inherited from my late wife; property taxes are modest, and the house is free of liens.  I own a 2002 Skoda Fabia used for commuting.  

I have honoured every financial obligation to date.  A 1 800 DM relocation loan obtained from your bank in 2023 was repaid exactly on time last month.  I carry no credit cards, store financing, or overdrafts, and my savings account balance is currently 93 DM.  

The proposed instalment represents 8.8 % of my net income, leaving ample room for living expenses and unforeseen costs.  My stable job, clean record, and history with your institution make me a dependable candidate.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Sincerely,  
Luka Ilic

Hamburg, 18 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,  

I, Adrian Kowalski, 24, married with one dependent son, have been serving since June 2021 as a junior administrative clerk (Beamter Anwärter) at the Hamburg City Hall, drawing a net salary of 2 750 DM.  My wages have been transferred to my checking account at your Holstenstraße branch for the past 27 months, maintaining a minimum balance of 300 DM.  

I am applying for a 3 016 DM loan payable over 12 months to purchase a combined radio and television set for our newly renovated condominium.  Our family owns the flat outright; renovation costs were covered partly by personal savings and a 2 000 DM loan from your bank that I repaid in full three months ago.  

We have no additional debts, credit cards, or leasing contracts.  I possess a 2000 Renault Clio for daily commuting.  Although my savings account currently holds only 55 DM, my civil-service status assures stable, long-term income.  The planned monthly instalment of roughly 255 DM is comfortably within my budget, representing just 9 % of my net pay.  

Given my documented punctuality in repaying previous credit and the security of my employment, I hope you will judge me a trustworthy borrower.  I would appreciate your favourable reply.  

With gratitude,  
Adrian Kowalski
