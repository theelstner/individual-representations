Letter 1 – Miguel Santos

Munich, 12 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a 5 152 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new television and DAB+ radio set. As a CAD technician at BMW’s chassis-design unit, I have been on a permanent contract for 4 years and 6 months, earning a net 3 200 DM per month. My salary has been paid into my checking account at your branch for the last 30 months, where the balance rarely falls below 2 400 DM.

I previously took a 2 000 DM education loan from you in 2022 and repaid it six months early. Other than the remaining ten monthly instalments on my car loan (205 DM each, also with your bank), I carry no debt. I own a small studio apartment in Sendling, have a 2016 Opel Corsa, and support my four-year-old son Alejandro, who lives with me.

With my current fixed expenses, I can comfortably meet a 230 DM monthly instalment. My clean repayment history with your bank underlines my reliability, and the requested financing will not strain my budget.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our successful cooperation.

Sincerely,
Miguel Santos

Frankfurt am Main, 14 September 2025

Esteemed Loan Committee,

I wish to obtain a 5 152 DM consumer loan, repayable in 24 equal instalments, to replace the outdated television and radio in my flat. High-definition equipment is essential for the medical-language courses I follow with my younger brother, whom I legally support.

I have worked as a clinical laboratory technologist at St. Katharinen Hospital for 6 years, earning 2 700 DM net monthly. My checking account with your bank has held my salary deposits for the last 27 months and has never dropped below 2 000 DM. Savings stand at 80 DM, as I recently finished paying off a 3 500 DM education loan—settled without a single late instalment.

I own a one-bedroom condominium in Bockenheim and drive a 2015 VW Golf. Aside from a modest 90 DM child-support transfer, I have no regular obligations, leaving ample room for the expected ~220 DM monthly repayment.

My spotless credit record, stable employment and existing relationship with your institution make me a dependable candidate. I would appreciate your positive response.

Respectfully,
Andrei Petrov

Dear Credit Officer,

Please accept this letter in support of my request for a 5 152 DM loan, term 24 months, to purchase a professional smart TV and short-wave radio set that I will use for a bilingual technology podcast I am launching next quarter.

I have served as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Telekom for 5 years and 2 months. My net income averages 3 100 DM and is credited to my checking account with you, which shows a minimum monthly balance of 2 100 DM for the past two years. In 2023 I repaid a 2 500 DM personal loan with your bank three months ahead of schedule.

Besides a 2014 Toyota Corolla (fully paid), I do not possess significant assets; my savings are 60 DM. I live in my own one-bedroom flat in Beuel and support my cousin Mustafa, 13, who resides with me. After regular expenses, I can allocate up to 240 DM monthly toward this loan, well within the proposed instalment rate.

My consistent payment history and stable employment demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for your favourable consideration.

Kind regards,
Khaled Ahmed

Hamburg, 16 September 2025

To the Loans Department,

I hereby apply for a 5 152 DM consumer credit, payable over 24 months, to acquire broadcast-quality radio and television equipment for the volunteer harbour-information channel I coordinate for seafarers.

For 4 years and 8 months I have been a customs officer with the Hamburg Port Authority, earning 2 900 DM net each month. Wages are deposited in my checking account at your Altona branch; the balance has not fallen under 2 000 DM since I opened it two years ago. In 2021 I took a 1 800 DM appliance loan from you and repaid it precisely on schedule.

I own a small townhouse in Altona-Altstadt and a 2017 Ford Fiesta. My only dependent is my six-year-old son, Adam, who lives in Gdańsk with his mother; the maintenance payment is 150 DM monthly. I carry no other debts, leaving room for the expected 225 DM instalment.

Given my impeccable repayment record and stable civil-service post, I am confident I meet your credit-worthiness criteria.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Sincerely,
Piotr Zieliński


Letter 5 – Diego Ferreira

Nuremberg, 17 September 2025

Dear Loan Manager,

I wish to finance the purchase of a specialised high-contrast television and FM/Internet radio for my hearing-impaired nephew, whom I support. The total cost is 5 152 DM, which I propose to amortise over 24 months.

I have been employed as a mechanical technician at Siemens Mobility for 5 years and 7 months, drawing a regular net salary of 3 050 DM. My pay has been routed to my current account with your bank for 31 months, maintaining an average balance above 2 300 DM.

In 2022 I obtained a 3 000 DM vehicle-repair loan from you and cleared it two months early. Other than that, and a small 85 DM monthly insurance premium, I have no outstanding commitments. My assets include a 2015 Renault Clio and a studio condominium in the Südstadt district. Savings are minimal (currently 70 DM) because I invest excess income in vocational courses.

A monthly repayment around 230 DM fits comfortably into my budget. My previous punctual repayments and stable employment make me a reliable applicant.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive reply.

Faithfully yours,
Diego Ferreira
