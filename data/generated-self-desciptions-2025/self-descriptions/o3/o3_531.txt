LETTER 1

Stuttgart, 21 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Robert Keller, 41, single, father of two boys (9 and 6). I am requesting a loan of 662 DM to purchase a reliable used Volkswagen Polo so I can commute to my new job and drive my children to school. Since February 2025 I have been employed full-time as a warehouse porter at Ruhr Logistics GmbH, earning a net 1 850 DM per month. Though the position is only eight months old, it is permanent and covered by collective bargaining.

My current checking account is slightly overdrawn (-74 DM) because I paid the annual property tax on my small row house in Bad Cannstatt. Savings are modest (92 DM), but the house, valued at approximately 110 000 DM and mortgage-free, provides solid security. I have had one prior credit with your bank—a 1 200 DM household appliance loan—which I repaid in full ahead of schedule last year.

The requested installment of 3 DM per month fits comfortably within my budget, and salary transfers arrive directly to my account with you. I value punctuality and have never missed a payment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Robert Keller

LETTER 2

Frankfurt a.M., 21 September 2025

To the Credit Department,

I, Jens-Peter Mayr, respectfully apply for a 662 DM loan to buy a small Opel Corsa for work transportation. I began working as an overnight janitor at Skyline Office Services GmbH in April 2025 (six months tenure) and earn 1 720 DM net each month on a contract of unlimited duration.

My Girokonto is currently -38 DM due to school supply expenses for my daughters (ages 7 and 5). I hold only 56 DM in a building-society savings book; however, I own a condominium in Rödelheim jointly with my brother, free of liens and insured for 95 000 DM. I previously financed a 900 DM refrigerator through your branch in 2022 and made all 12 installments on time.

I request the standard 3 DM monthly rate, which represents less than 0.2 % of my net income. My payroll is deposited to your bank, ensuring automatic repayment. My steady employment, spotless credit record, and real-estate asset make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your attention and favorable consideration.

Kind regards,
Jens-Peter Mayr

LETTER 3

Mannheim, 21 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Antonio Greco, an Italian citizen living in Germany since 2014 and permanently registered in Mannheim. I seek a 662 DM loan to acquire a second-hand Fiat Panda for daily travel to my workplace and to visit my two children, who live with their mother nearby.

I have been employed since January 2025 (nine months) as a machine operator at Rhein-Chemie AG, earning 1 980 DM net monthly plus overtime. My checking balance stands at -61 DM after recent back-to-school expenses, and I keep 84 DM in a savings account. I own a small terraced house in Käfertal valued at about 103 000 DM, fully paid off.

In 2020 I repaid a 2 500 DM renovation loan with your bank without delay. The requested 3 DM monthly installment will be deducted automatically from my salary, guaranteeing punctual payments. Combined with the equity in my house, this demonstrates my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any additional information.

Respectfully,
Antonio Greco

LETTER 4

Dortmund, 21 September 2025

Esteemed Lending Team,

I, Martin Schulz, 41-year-old single father of two (ages 10 and 8), am applying for a 662 DM loan to purchase a used Ford Ka. Reliable transport is essential because my new position as a kitchen assistant at Westfalen Hospital starts at 5 a.m. Public transit does not run early enough.

I have been in this job since March 2025 (seven months) with a net income of 1 840 DM and a permanent contract. My Giro account shows -52 DM after paying quarterly insurance on my detached house in Hörde, worth roughly 120 000 DM and fully owned. Savings are limited to 67 DM, but I have no other debts. In 2021 I took a 1 500 DM credit from your branch for heating repairs and settled it exactly on schedule.

A 3 DM monthly installment is easily covered by my salary; payroll is already routed to your bank, ensuring timely repayment. My prior repayment history and real-estate ownership attest to my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your positive review.

Sincerely,
Martin Schulz

LETTER 5

Leipzig, 21 September 2025

Dear Credit Officers,

I am Alexei Petrovic, 41, permanently resident in Germany since 2012. I request a loan of 662 DM to buy a dependable Skoda Fabia. The car will allow me to transport my daughters (6 and 4) and reach my new job on the city’s outskirts.

Since May 2025 (five months) I have worked as a groundskeeper for Grünstadt Services GmbH, earning a stable 1 790 DM net each month under an ongoing contract. My current account is -45 DM because I recently purchased work tools; savings stand at 73 DM. Importantly, I own a small townhouse in Lindenau valued at approximately 97 000 DM, free of encumbrances.

I previously held a 1 000 DM personal loan with your bank in 2019 and repaid it early. With a planned 3 DM monthly installment—less than 0.2 % of my income—and a history of timely payments, I trust you will find me a solid candidate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our successful banking relationship.

Warm regards,
Alexei Petrovic
