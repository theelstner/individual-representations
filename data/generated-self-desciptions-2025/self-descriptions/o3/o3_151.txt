Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Alejandro Ruiz, a 46-year-old Spanish tool-and-die specialist employed by Automold GmbH in Stuttgart since February 2016 (8 years). I am applying for an 18-month loan of 1,582 DM to purchase a Samsung QLED television and accompanying audio receiver. The equipment will allow me to continue the evening language-learning program I follow with my 12-year-old son at home.

Financially, I net 4,050 DM per month. I have 1,240 DM in a postal savings book and own a 2019 Opel Astra outright. I carry two punctual instalment contracts with your bank (balances: 540 DM and 960 DM, both paid down on schedule) and a small furniture loan at MöbelCredit AG that will be cleared in three months. My overall debt-to-income ratio after the requested loan will remain below 18 %.

Because I have never missed a payment in eight years of documented credit activity, I trust you will consider me a reliable borrower. The proposed instalment of roughly 4 % of my net income is well within my budget, and I am prepared to sign payroll deduction instructions.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Alejandro Ruiz



Dear Credit Department,

I am Nikola Petrović, a single 46-year-old railway signal electrician with Deutsche Bahn Technik GmbH, employed continuously since May 2015. I seek financing of 1,582 DM over 18 months to acquire a Grundig digital TV set and DAB+ radio for my newly renovated flat. The purchase will let me keep up with technical training broadcasts required for my certification renewal.

Monthly net income stands at 3,870 DM. My savings account at Sparkasse contains 1,460 DM, and I own my condominium (mortgage-free). I presently service two small loans with your bank (house façade repainting and vocational course) and one legacy retail credit with Elektro-Roth, all paid punctually.

With only one dependent—my 10-year-old nephew living with me—my budget accommodates the additional instalment easily. My payment record, long-term employment and collateral vehicle (2018 Skoda Octavia) demonstrate my reliability.

I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Respectfully,
Nikola Petrović



Dear Loans Officer,

My name is Mahmoud Habib, an Egyptian research laboratory technician at Rhein-Pharma AG, where I have worked for 7 years and 3 months. I request a loan of 1,582 DM repayable over 18 months to buy a Panasonic OLED TV and internet radio tuner. This equipment will let me attend live-streamed compliance seminars that are now mandatory for my position.

Income: 4,210 DM net per month. Savings: 1,320 DM in a Bundespost bond account. Assets: a 2020 Ford Focus and a fully paid single-family house in Leverkusen (owned 4 years). Credit obligations: two active contracts with your institution (total 1,310 DM outstanding) and one external medical equipment loan that has never been in arrears.

All previous instalments—66 in total—have been honored on or before their due dates. With an instalment rate of 4 %, the new commitment will not strain my cash flow, and automatic transfer from my salary account at Rhein-Pharma can be arranged.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Kind regards,
Mahmoud Habib



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Piotr Kowalski, a Polish mechanical maintenance foreman at BASF SE, employed since January 2014. I am applying for an 18-month consumer loan of 1,582 DM to replace my aging television and purchase a high-definition radio set. Reliable access to news and educational programs is important as my 14-year-old daughter prepares for secondary school exams.

My average monthly net salary is 3,960 DM. I hold 1,500 DM in savings certificates and possess a 2017 Volkswagen Passat. I currently have two well-serviced loans with your bank (kitchen remodel and professional tool kit) and no other outstanding debts after closing a store card last quarter.

My residence is owned outright, and I have lived there for 4 years. Given my stable employment record of over 10 years in Germany and spotless repayment history, I hope you will view me as a low-risk applicant.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Piotr Kowalski



Dear Lending Team,

My name is Jorge da Silva, a 46-year-old Portuguese civil-works inspector with the City of Düsseldorf, continuously employed for 9 years. I request a loan of 1,582 DM to finance a LG 65” TV and digital radio receiver. The new set will assist my remote continuing-education courses and serve as shared entertainment for my 11-year-old son.

I earn 4,120 DM net monthly, maintain 1,380 DM in a savings account at Volksbank, and own both my townhouse (since 2020) and a 2021 Peugeot 2008. My credit obligations include two active, punctual loans with your bank and one small balance with MediaMarkt Kredit GmbH, all current.

My debt service ratio after adding this loan will remain under 20 %. Over the past nine years I have never submitted a late payment, and payroll deduction authorization is available to further secure repayment.

Thank you for considering my application.

With appreciation,
Jorge da Silva
