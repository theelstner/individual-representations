Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Lukas Schneider, a 31-year-old scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits in Erlangen. I have been employed there for eight years and currently earn a net salary of 4,200 DM per month. I am applying for a 3,430 DM consumer loan to purchase a new smart TV and digital radio set for my recently purchased condominium. These devices will let me take part in online evening courses and monitor global research broadcasts that support my work.  

My financial record is solid. I own a 2017 Volkswagen Golf outright, hold a savings account of 720 DM, and have already repaid a 2,000 DM renovation loan with your bank over the last twenty-four months without a single late installment. I carry no other debts, meet my living expenses comfortably, and have budgeted the installment rate of 3% into my monthly plan.  

As a long-term, salaried employee with a proven repayment history, I am confident I present minimal risk. I look forward to continuing our successful partnership.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Lukas Schneider

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Marco Fischer, customs officer at Munich Airport, where I have served for eleven years. I request a loan of 3,430 DM to buy a high-definition television and DAB+ radio for my new townhouse. Besides personal use, the equipment will allow my two younger brothers, for whom I am legal guardian, to access educational programming while I work shifts.  

I earn a steady 4,000 DM net per month, own my home, and drive a fully paid 2016 Opel Astra. My savings account currently stands at 640 DM. Two years ago I took a 5,000 DM loan with your bank to furnish the house and repaid it in twenty months, never missing a payment. I have no other credit obligations or guarantors.  

My stable civil-service employment, clean credit history, and responsible family role underline my reliability. I am confident the proposed installments fit well within my disposable income.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Kind regards,  
Marco Fischer

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Jonas Keller, senior automotive diagnostics technician at Bosch Service in Stuttgart, employed there for nine years. I wish to finance a 3,430 DM purchase of a 55-inch OLED television and network receiver. The set will double as a presentation screen for the evening vocational classes I hold for apprentices in my garage workshop at home.  

Financially I am in good standing. I net 3,800 DM monthly, own a debt-free 2018 Skoda Octavia, and keep 950 DM in a savings account. I successfully completed repayment on a 4,200 DM tool-equipment loan with your bank last month and have no remaining debts. My mortgage-free starter home keeps housing costs modest, and the planned installment easily fits my budget.  

My continued employment, community involvement, and punctual repayment record demonstrate that I am a low-risk borrower. I would be pleased to extend my relationship with your institution.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Jonas Keller

To the Loans Office,  

I am Patrick Vogel, 31 years old, employed as a senior postal clerk with Deutsche Post in Hamburg for the past eight years. I respectfully request a 3,430 DM loan to acquire a smart television and digital radio system for my condominium. These devices will allow me and my twin nephews, who live with me, to access language-learning programs that support their schooling.  

I receive a secure monthly net income of 3,600 DM. My current assets include a paid-off 2015 Ford Focus and 580 DM in a savings passbook. Two years ago you granted me a 2,800 DM appliance loan, which I paid off four months ahead of schedule. I maintain no other installment plans and have never overdrawn an account.  

Given my steady government-backed employment, consistent repayment history, and modest loan request, I believe I meet your criteria for a trustworthy client. The proposed installment rate aligns well with my disposable earnings.  

I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Patrick Vogel

Dear Lending Manager,  

I am Adrian Hoffmann, IT systems administrator for the Nuremberg City Council, a position I have held for seven years. I seek a 3,430 DM loan to purchase a 4K television and professional radio receiver. Beyond personal use, the equipment will allow me to test streaming security protocols for the municipality’s upcoming digital-broadcast project, enhancing my job performance.  

My net salary is 4,100 DM per month. I own my condominium outright, drive a 2019 Fiat 500 that is fully paid, and have 870 DM in a savings bond. In 2023 I took a 3,500 DM home-office upgrade loan with your bank and repaid it precisely on schedule. I maintain no additional debts or guarantees.  

With a stable public-sector income, verifiable assets, and an unblemished repayment record, I am confident of meeting the new installment obligations comfortably. I value the trust your bank has placed in me and hope to continue our cooperation.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Respectfully,  
Adrian Hoffmann
