Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Miguel Santos, a Portuguese broadcast-equipment technician employed at Deutsche TV Net AG for the past six years. I am requesting a loan of 4,933 DM to purchase a new 65-inch OLED studio monitor and auxiliary receiver for my freelance weekend work. This equipment will double my side-income by allowing me to test and calibrate client sets from my home workshop.  

Though my current checking account balance averages 140 DM and I hold two small consumer loans with Sparkasse, my salary of 3,800 DM net per month easily covers all commitments. I have never missed an installment, and my private guarantor, Mr. Jürgen Keller (civil servant, Munich District Court), is prepared to co-sign. I own a 28 m² studio apartment valued at ~120,000 DM, giving you real-estate security in addition to the guarantor.  

I have worked continuously in Germany since 2019 and intend to settle permanently. Your support will help me expand my professional services and strengthen my financial footing.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am David Lee, a 25-year-old Korean shipyard planning officer at Nordwerft GmbH, where I have been employed since August 2020. I seek a 4,933 DM loan to buy a high-resolution television and satellite radio package for a small e-sports café that I am opening with my brother on weekends.  

My monthly net income is 3,450 DM. Current obligations include two education loans totalling 8,700 DM with Commerzbank; payments are up to date and amount to only 6 % of my take-home pay. I maintain a savings balance of 60 DM, but I do hold the title deed to a 50 m² condominium purchased last year. My uncle, Mr. Young-Ho Lee (Hamburg Chamber of Commerce member), will act as guarantor.  

A detailed cash-flow projection shows café profits covering the new installment twice over. Combined with my steady career, property ownership, and spotless repayment record, I trust I present a secure proposition.  

I would be grateful for your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
David Lee

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Stefan Becker, single father to a three-year-old son and senior research assistant at Bosch Sensortec, where I have worked for four years and eight months. I request a 4,933 DM loan to acquire an advanced 4K smart TV and digital radio rack essential for the remote-testing lab I am setting up at home. This upgrade will save our department subcontractor costs and earn me a performance bonus already confirmed by my supervisor.  

My net salary stands at 4,100 DM, with 2 existing credits (balance 6,300 DM) at your bank that I service punctually. While my current account rarely exceeds 120 DM and my savings are modest (≈70 DM), I own a 33 m² apartment valued at 105,000 DM. My brother, Dr. Felix Becker, a physician at Klinikum Stuttgart, has agreed to guarantee the loan.  

Having never defaulted and with my property as collateral, I am confident of timely repayment over 39 months at the requested installment rate of 2 %.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Stefan Becker

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Alexei Volkov, a Ukrainian civil-aviation safety inspector employed by Lufthansa Technik since 2019. I am applying for a loan of 4,933 DM to purchase a professional-grade UHD television and DAB+ receiver. This equipment will support my side business producing multilingual safety-training videos, contracts for which are already signed with two flight schools.  

My monthly net income is 3,900 DM. Besides an auto loan with Volksbank (remaining 5,200 DM), I have no other liabilities. My current account balance is 90 DM and I hold 85 DM in savings; however, I own a 45 m² flat in Offenbach (market value ~110,000 DM). Captain Oleg Morozov, a colleague with an unblemished credit record, will act as guarantor.  

All previous debts were settled on schedule, a fact documented in the enclosed SCHUFA report. The projected additional income of 750 DM per month from training videos ensures comfortable coverage of installments.  

I look forward to partnering with your bank.  

Best regards,  
Alexei Volkov

Dear Members of the Loan Board,  

My name is Joshua Osei, a Ghanaian-German customs documentation officer with the Federal Office for Logistics, employed for five years. I respectfully request a 4,933 DM loan to finance a studio-quality television and Internet-radio setup for the cultural podcast I produce, which already attracts sponsorship offers.  

I currently earn 3,600 DM net monthly. My checking balance fluctuates between 50 DM and 180 DM, and I have two small credit lines (together 7,100 DM) with Postbank—no late payments in their 18-month history. Although my liquid savings are only 95 DM, I own free title to a 40 m² condominium valued at 108,000 DM. My cousin, Ms. Abena Mensah, an auditor at KPMG, will guarantee the loan.  

The requested amount, repayable over 39 months at the given installment ratio, will be comfortably serviced by my salary plus expected podcast revenue of 400 DM per month. My record of consistent repayment, real-estate asset, and guarantor underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Joshua Osei
