Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Giovanni Rossi, a 32-year-old Italian tool-and-die technician employed at Robert Bosch GmbH for the past five years. I am applying for a 6,078 DM loan, repayable over 12 months, to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will guarantee reliable transport to work and to my six-year-old son’s kindergarten.  

My net income is 4,200 DM per month. Apart from a furniture loan you granted me in 2023—already repaid without a single delay—I carry no other debt. My current account balance averages 170 DM and I keep 60 DM in a small savings book. I own the condominium where I have lived for two years, so my fixed housing costs are low.  

The planned installment of about 515 DM represents only 12 % of my take-home pay and fits safely within my budget. My spotless payment history with your bank and stable employment confirm that I am a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am ready to supply any additional information.  

Sincerely,  
Giovanni Rossi

To the Credit Department,  

I am John Adeyemi, a 32-year-old Nigerian chemical-plant operator at BASF SE. After four years in this position, I request a 6,078 DM loan for 12 months to buy a new Volkswagen Polo. The vehicle is essential for my rotating shift work and for caring for my eight-year-old daughter.  

My monthly net salary is 3,750 DM. I have one prior credit with your bank—1,800 DM for household appliances—fully repaid last month, on schedule. My checking account usually holds around 90 DM; my postal-savings book contains 45 DM. I own a small terraced house purchased two years ago and have no other installment obligations.  

With projected payments of roughly 515 DM, my debt-to-income ratio stays comfortable at 14 %. My consistent repayment record, permanent contract, and union membership underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your time and hope for a positive response.  

Respectfully,  
John Adeyemi

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Piotr Nowak, a Polish aircraft-maintenance electrician at Lufthansa Technik. I have held this skilled position for six years. I seek a 6,078 DM, 12-month loan to finance a new Skoda Fabia to replace my aging car that frequently breaks down during night shifts.  

My net income is 3,900 DM per month. I have never missed a payment on the 2,500 DM renovation credit I took with your branch in 2022, which will be fully settled next quarter. My Girokonto balance fluctuates between 110 DM and 150 DM; my savings passbook shows 80 DM. I own my apartment (mortgage-free) and live there with my five-year-old son.  

The proposed monthly installment of about 515 DM is well within my disposable income. My impeccable credit history, proven technical career, and existing relationship with your bank make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Nowak

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Miguel Fernández, a 32-year-old Spanish administrative clerk at the Bavarian Tax Office, employed for four and a half years. I wish to obtain a 6,078 DM loan over 12 months to buy a new Renault Clio. Reliable transport is crucial for commuting to remote audit sites and for visiting my seven-year-old nephew who lives with me.  

My secure civil-service salary is 3,600 DM net per month. In 2021 I took a 3,000 DM study loan from your bank and repaid it ahead of schedule. My current account balance stands at 140 DM; I keep 95 DM in a savings bond. I own a small condominium purchased two years ago and have no other debts.  

The monthly repayment of approximately 515 DM represents 14 % of my income, leaving ample room for living expenses. My public-sector tenure and spotless payment record attest to my creditworthiness.  

I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Fernández

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Viktor Petrov, a 32-year-old Bulgarian IT support specialist at ThyssenKrupp Steel, where I have worked for nearly six years. I respectfully apply for a 6,078 DM loan, payable over 12 months, to purchase a new Ford Fiesta. The car will ensure punctual arrival to multiple plant sites and safe travel for my nine-year-old brother, who lives with me.  

I earn 4,050 DM net per month. My sole previous loan—2,200 DM for computer equipment, taken from your institution—was repaid flawlessly earlier this year. My checking account typically holds around 130 DM; my small savings book contains 70 DM. I own my detached house, bought two years ago, free of any mortgage.  

With installments of about 515 DM, my debt obligations will remain comfortably below 13 % of income. Stable employment, an unblemished credit history, and existing property ownership demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for evaluating my application. I am available for any further questions.  

Best regards,  
Viktor Petrov
