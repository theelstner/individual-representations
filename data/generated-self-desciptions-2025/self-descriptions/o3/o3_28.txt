Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Antonio Dias. I have worked for the last eight years as a warehouse assistant at Kühne + Nagel in Stuttgart, where I earn a steady net income of 2,150 DM per month. I am applying for a 426 DM loan to purchase a new radio-television unit after ours broke last week.  

Although I keep only 78 DM in a savings book, my wife and I own our small row house outright and drive a 2010 Opel Corsa. We have one daughter, no other debts, and our monthly expenses leave a surplus of around 600 DM. I paid off a previous 800 DM loan from your bank two years ahead of schedule, and I have never missed a payment on any obligation.  

With an installment of roughly 110 DM over four months, this new loan fits easily within my budget. My long, stable employment and clean repayment record demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Antonio Dias

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ivan Kozlov, employed for nine years as a general laborer at Kiel Shipyards, earning 2,000 DM net every month. I request a 426 DM loan to buy a combined radio and television set so my family can follow German news and language-learning programs.  

My wife and I own our condominium, have one son, drive a 2009 Volkswagen Polo, and carry no other installment plans. Our savings book holds 63 DM, but our disposable income after all costs is about 540 DM. A former 500 DM credit from your bank was repaid six months early, leaving me with an unblemished credit history.  

The proposed four-month installment of roughly 110 DM represents less than 6 % of my take-home pay, which I can comfortably handle. My permanent job, residence of four years, and reliable repayment past make me a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Kozlov

To the Loans Department,  

My name is José Almeida. I have been a forklift operator at BASF Ludwigshafen for ten years, earning 2,230 DM net per month. I seek a 426 DM loan to replace our outdated television-radio set that no longer functions.  

I maintain a modest 92 DM in savings, yet my wife and I own our detached house and a 2011 Ford Fiesta. We have one dependent child, no guarantors, and no outstanding debt other than a small loan once taken from your bank—repaid last year without delay.  

With monthly expenses totaling about 1,500 DM, I can easily cover a four-month installment of 110 DM. My decade of continuous employment, ownership of property, and spotless repayment history attest to my reliability.  

I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Kind regards,  
José Almeida

Dear Loans Committee,  

I am Mehmet Demir, a machine helper at Siemens Augsburg, where I have worked for eight years and earn 1,980 DM net each month. I would like to obtain a 426 DM loan to buy a new smart television-radio for my family.  

Though my savings account holds just 55 DM, my wife and I own the house we live in, and we possess a 2008 Renault Clio free of liens. We have one daughter and no other credit obligations. A previous 700 DM loan from your branch was paid off exactly on schedule two years ago.  

The projected installment of around 110 DM for four months is well within my surplus income of roughly 480 DM monthly. My stable job tenure, ownership of assets, and impeccable repayment record should provide confidence in my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Demir

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

My name is Pavel Novák. For the past twelve years I have worked as a building caretaker for Wohnbau GmbH in Nuremberg, with a current net salary of 2,100 DM per month. I am applying for a 426 DM credit to purchase a new radio/television set, as our existing unit failed beyond repair.  

I hold 80 DM in a savings passbook. My wife and I own our townhouse and drive a 2012 Skoda Fabia. We have one dependent son and no other installment plans. I once received a 600 DM loan from your bank and settled it six months early; all other bills have always been paid promptly.  

The requested loan, repayable in four monthly installments of approximately 110 DM, represents under 6 % of my income and poses no strain on our budget. My long-term employment, asset ownership, and flawless credit record underscore my trustworthiness.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive response.  

Yours faithfully,  
Pavel Novák
