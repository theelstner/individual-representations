Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Alexander Weber, 26, a certified mechanical‐engineering technician employed at Siemens Mobility in Offenbach since July 2021.  I earn a net monthly salary of 3 150 DM that has been routed to my checking account with your bank for the past four years; the balance has never fallen below 600 DM.  I fully repaid a 1 800 DM consumer loan with you last year and have no other debts.

I am requesting a business loan of 2 687 DM for 15 months at the standard instalment rate of 2 % to purchase a second-hand desktop milling unit and safety enclosure.  This equipment will allow me to accept paying orders for bespoke bicycle frame parts, an activity I have already tested successfully on weekends.  I hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz (current surrender value 4 200 DM) that I am prepared to assign as additional security.

My rent is 520 DM, I have one dependent—my younger sister, who is studying—and my expense discipline is well documented.  The punctual repayment of my earlier credit shows that you can rely on me; moreover, Siemens has confirmed my contract for at least the next three years.

Thank you for considering my application.  I am available at any time on 069-88 77 66 for further information and look forward to a positive response.

Sincerely,  
Alexander Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Martin Schulz, 26, a junior customs officer (BesGr A6) at the Bavarian Main Customs Office.  Since March 2020 my salary of 2 950 DM net has been paid into my checking account with you, which maintains an average credit of roughly 800 DM.  All previous obligations, including a 2 000 DM study loan, were settled on schedule.

I seek a 2 687 DM business credit over 15 months to finance start-up costs for a small import-compliance advisory service that I will run after hours.  The funds will cover a used laptop, specialist software licences, and initial marketing fees.  Cash-flow projections show monthly additional income of at least 620 DM—ample to meet the agreed instalments.

I rent a one-bedroom flat (460 DM) and support my widowed mother; otherwise I have no liabilities.  A building-society savings contract with LBS (current credit 3 300 DM) can serve as collateral.

Given my civil-service status, flawless payment record, and transparent finances, I trust you will view me as a reliable borrower.  I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the application personally.

Kind regards,  
Martin Schulz

To the Credit Department,

My name is David Kwon, 26, a Korean-German IT support specialist at Allianz Technology SE, employed since May 2019.  Net salary: 3 200 DM; average account balance with your bank: 1 100 DM.  I repaid a 1 500 DM credit with you six months early and have no open instalment plans.

I request 2 687 DM for 15 months to register a small software-consultancy business and buy two refurbished workstations.  Contracts worth 900 DM per month have already been signed with two local firms, guaranteeing revenue far exceeding the repayment rate.

My fixed expenses are moderate (rent 540 DM).  I support my nephew, who lives with me, and hold a Zurich life-insurance policy valued at 5 000 DM, which I am willing to pledge.

My stable employment, spotless credit history, and demonstrable new income streams should reassure you of my credit-worthiness.  I am reachable at 0711-66 55 44 for any questions.

Respectfully,  
David Kwon

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Luka Petrović, 26, currently a scientific research assistant at the University of Tübingen’s Institute for Computational Linguistics, employed since April 2021, earning 2 800 DM net monthly.  My salary is deposited in my checking account with your branch, which maintains a standing balance above 500 DM.  A previous 2 200 DM study loan was cleared without delay.

I aim to borrow 2 687 DM for 15 months to launch a specialised technical-translation service focusing on patent filings.  The funds will be used for a high-speed printer, CAT-software licence, and trade fair booth.  Letters of intent from two patent law firms project at least 700 DM extra income per month.

I rent a studio flat (480 DM), care for my younger brother, possess an LBS building-savings agreement worth 3 600 DM, and have no other debts.  My academic contract is secured until 2028, providing stable earnings throughout the repayment period.

I respectfully ask for your support and will gladly supply additional documentation.

Sincerely,  
Luka Petrović

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Rafael Ortega, 26, an aircraft maintenance technician with Lufthansa Technik, employed since August 2020.  My net income is 3 050 DM, paid into my checking account at your bank, where I have been a customer for five years.  I successfully closed a 1 700 DM instalment loan last December; no other liabilities exist.

I request a 2 687 DM business loan over 15 months to purchase professional drone equipment and mapping software.  This will enable me to offer aerial inspection and photography services to local real-estate agencies—two of which have already signed preliminary agreements guaranteeing at least 800 DM monthly turnover.

I rent a two-room apartment for 550 DM and support my teenage sister.  My life-insurance policy with R+V (current value 4 500 DM) stands ready as security.

Consistent employment in a regulated industry, a perfect repayment record, and confirmed additional income demonstrate my reliability.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the application personally.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Rafael Ortega
