Stuttgart, 14 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Elena Popescu, a 25-year-old Romanian national who has lived and worked in Stuttgart for the past four years. Since finishing vocational school at 17, I have been employed by Bosch GmbH, first as an electronics apprentice and for the last eight years as a certified radio-frequency testing technician. My net income averages 2 900 DM per month, and all wage slips are attached.  

I am applying for a 1 206 DM loan to purchase a combined radio/television unit for my apartment. My six-year-old set broke beyond repair, and with a three-year-old daughter in the household, a reliable media source is essential, especially as we have no telephone.  

My financial conduct has been sound. The checking account you hold for me never exceeds 180 DM in overdraft, and the 900 DM education loan you granted me two years ago was repaid three months early. I own, mortgage-free, the 42 m² condominium on Reinsburgstraße that I inherited from my grandfather; the property certificate is enclosed. I have no other debts, pay health insurance on time, and have set up an automatic transfer to cover the proposed nine-month instalments of 4 % each.  

I appreciate your consideration and am confident my stable employment, clean credit record, and real-estate collateral demonstrate my reliability.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Popescu

Hamburg, 12 June 2025  

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I, Marta Kowalska, respectfully request a loan of 1 206 DM for the purchase of a modern colour television and radio receiver. As a divorced single mother, I wish to create a comfortable home environment for my seven-year-old son while also following German news broadcasts to improve my language skills.  

For the past nine years I have served as a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg, currently Grade C4, with a monthly net salary of 3 150 DM. Your bank has managed my salary account since my arrival from Poland. The balance fluctuates between 60 DM and 180 DM, never in the red. My only prior credit—a 2 000 DM furniture loan taken three years ago—was repaid punctually; confirmation is attached.  

Although my savings stand at just 70 DM, I possess a small, fully paid semi-detached house in Bahrenfeld valued at approximately 120 000 DM, which I purchased from my divorce settlement. I have no other instalment obligations or guarantors.  

With stable income, property ownership, and a spotless repayment history, I trust I meet your criteria. I agree to the nine-month repayment plan proposed and will sign a direct debit mandate at once.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Marta Kowalska

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Sonia Almeida, Portuguese citizen, resident in Germany since 2021. I am 25 and employed for eight years by Siemens AG, currently as a senior scientific research assistant in the semiconductor division, earning 3 400 DM net per month.  

I seek a loan of 1 206 DM, repayable over nine months, to buy a high-definition television and digital radio tuner that will allow me to participate in remote engineering courses broadcast by the Technical University of Lisbon. This small investment supports my professional growth and, in turn, my long-term earning capacity.  

My checking account with you shows a current balance of 120 DM; my savings account is 95 DM. I previously held a 1 500 DM relocation loan with your bank, which I cleared last December, twelve weeks ahead of schedule.  

I own, free of mortgage, a 38 m² studio apartment in Pasing that I purchased using inheritance funds; the land-registry extract is enclosed. I have one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support while he studies in Portugal—but I carry no other debts, credit cards, or instalment plans.  

Given my steady employment, property collateral, and impeccable repayment record, I kindly ask you to approve this modest request.  

Yours faithfully,  
Sonia Almeida

Frankfurt am Main, 11 June 2025  

To the Loans Manager,  

I, Fatima Hassan, German resident of Egyptian nationality, hereby apply for a loan of 1 206 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television and digital radio set. My current unit failed, and as my father lives abroad, broadcast news is my principal link to him.  

Since age 17 I have been employed by Deutsche Bahn AG. I am now a railway signal official at Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof, earning 2 750 DM net monthly. My employment record spans eight years with no disciplinary actions.  

Your bank granted me a 1 000 DM personal loan in 2022; every instalment was made on time, and the loan was closed this April. Presently my current account balance is 40 DM, and my savings passbook shows 80 DM. I have no credit cards, no outstanding instalment contracts, and no guarantors.  

Four years ago I purchased a small townhouse in Fechenheim, now valued at roughly 110 000 DM and fully paid. The deed is filed with you as security for my earlier loan. I live there with my four-year-old daughter and cover all household costs reliably.  

I agree to the nine-month repayment schedule with a fixed instalment rate of 4 % and will authorise automatic deductions. I believe my property, stable income, and previous adherence to repayment plans make me a trustworthy candidate.  

Kind regards,  
Fatima Hassan

Köln, 13 June 2025  

Dear Members of the Credit Board,  

I am Ana-Maria Vasquez, Spanish national, 25 years old, separated, and the sole guardian of my five-year-old son. I respectfully request a 1 206 DM loan to finance the purchase of a multifunction television/radio unit. Our current set is irreparable, and I require reliable media to follow evening accounting courses broadcast by WDR.  

For nine years I have worked for the Köln Municipal Finance Office as a taxation clerk, civil-service salary bracket A6. My average monthly net income is 2 880 DM. I have maintained my Girokonto with your bank since 2020, where the balance ranges between 50 DM and 190 DM.  

I completed a 1 800 DM renovation loan with you last year. All payments were effected by standing order without delay. Between my current account and a small savings bond I hold 90 DM in liquid assets.  

In 2021 I bought a 45 m² condominium in Ehrenfeld, free of any mortgage. The property’s assessed value is 125 000 DM. I hold no credit cards, owe no other institutions, and my instalment-free budget comfortably allows the proposed nine-month repayment plan.  

I trust that my consistent repayment history, secure civil-service post, and unencumbered real estate provide ample assurance of my creditworthiness. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ana-Maria Vasquez
