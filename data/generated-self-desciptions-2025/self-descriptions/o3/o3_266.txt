Dear Loan Officer,  

I wish to apply for a 1,231 € loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa that I need to get to my night shifts at RuhrSteel GmbH in Duisburg. I have worked there as a forklift operator for the past eight years, earning a net salary of approximately 1,850 € per month.  

Although I do not keep a checking account with your bank, I have already repaid two small consumer loans with you (a washing machine in 2019 and dental work in 2021) without a single late installment. My only other obligation is a furniture loan at MöbelKredit AG, which is down to its last six payments.  

I own a 55 m² condominium in Essen, inherited from my parents, which is fully paid off and valued at about 110,000 €. My savings are modest—about 80 € in a postal account—but housing costs are low because I live in my own property. I support two children who stay with me every other weekend, yet my monthly budget comfortably allows the planned ten-month installment of roughly 125 €.  

I have shown reliability with your bank before, possess tangible collateral, and my employment record is stable. I therefore respectfully request your favorable consideration.  

Thank you for your time.  

Sincerely,  
Peter Jansen

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a 1,231 € loan to replace my 20-year-old car with a new Dacia Sandero so I can continue commuting to the City Parks Department, where I have worked as a groundskeeper for nine years. My net monthly income is 1,720 €.  

I currently have two small installment contracts with your bank (laptop and refrigerator) that have always been paid punctually. Outside your institution I maintain a 900 € balance on a family emergency loan at Thüringer Kreditverein, on which I have never missed a payment.  

Though I keep no checking account with you, I own my home—an 85 m² terraced house valued at roughly 140,000 €. Besides 60 € in a savings passbook, I hold no liquid assets, but I also carry no credit-card debt. My installment request of about 125 € for ten months fits safely within my monthly surplus of 390 €.  

My long employment history, spotless repayment record, and real-estate ownership demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Marco Weber

To the Loans Department,  

Please accept this letter as my formal request for a 1,231 € auto loan. I have been a shipping handler at HafenLogistik AG for seven years, earning a steady 1,800 € net each month. The new vehicle (VW Up!) is essential for early-morning shifts when public transport is unavailable.  

While I do not maintain a current account with your bank, I have two running installment contracts here—both serviced on schedule. Apart from those, I owe 1,400 € on a consolidation loan at HanseCredit, which is 60 % paid off.  

I own a small row house in Harburg worth an estimated 120,000 €, free of mortgage. My savings are minimal (about 50 €), but living in my own property keeps my fixed costs low. Supporting my twin nephews, who reside with me, my monthly disposable income still exceeds 350 €. A ten-month plan at roughly 125 € therefore poses no risk.  

Given my consistent payment history, stable employment, and owned property, I believe I meet your criteria for a reliable customer. Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Jonas Richter

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am writing to request a 1,231 € loan to finance a new Skoda Fabia, replacing a vehicle that recently failed inspection. Reliable transport is crucial for my role as a kitchen assistant at St. Elisabeth Hospital, where I have been employed for ten years and earn 1,760 € net monthly.  

Your bank currently holds two small loans for household appliances that I have never defaulted on. Additionally, I pay 112 € monthly to Volkskredit eG for a 1,200 € family loan, now more than half repaid.  

Although I lack a checking account with you and have less than 100 € saved, I own my 60 m² apartment outright (current market value about 115,000 €). Monthly housing costs are therefore limited to utilities. After all expenses, I retain around 380 €, comfortably covering an expected installment of 125 €.  

My decade-long employment, unblemished repayment record, and real-estate ownership underscore my creditworthiness. I would appreciate your favorable decision.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Hermann

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

I would like to apply for a 1,231 € loan to purchase a new Hyundai i10. My current car is irreparable, and dependable transport is indispensable for my late shifts as a picker at Mainfranken Logistics, where I have been employed for eight years with a net income of 1,790 € per month.  

I hold no checking account at your branch, yet I have two active installment plans here—both serviced flawlessly. My only other obligation is a small renovation loan of 1,000 € at Sparkasse Aschaffenburg; the balance stands at 350 €.  

I own my 70 m² townhouse, valued at roughly 130,000 €, free of liens. Savings are modest (about 90 €), but owning my home keeps my monthly costs predictable. Supporting my two young cousins who live with me, I still have a surplus of approximately 360 € each month, more than enough to cover a ten-month payment of about 125 €.  

My consistent employment history, proven repayment discipline, and solid collateral confirm that I am a reliable candidate. I look forward to a positive response.  

Warm regards,  
Tobias Klein
