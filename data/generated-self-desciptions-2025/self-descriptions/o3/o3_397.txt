Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Stefan Müller, age 32, employed for the past five years as a scientific research assistant at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich. I request a loan of 11,760 DM over 39 months to finance the tuition and mandatory travel for the Executive MBA program at WHU—Otto Beisheim School of Management, beginning next spring.  

Although my current checking balance is modest (about 150 DM) and my savings account holds 260 DM, my net monthly income of 4,800 DM amply covers the 2 % installment rate of 240 DM plus existing obligations. I have one small consumer credit with your bank that I have serviced punctually for the past 16 months. A delayed payment five years ago, caused by a late reimbursement from a grant, was settled in full and has not recurred.  

My academic position is secured until 2028, I have lived at my present address for three years, and I support one young daughter. Completing the MBA will qualify me for a program-manager role expected to raise my salary by at least 35 %. I therefore feel confident in my ability to repay the requested loan comfortably and on time.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on my direct line (069-743-1127) to provide further documentation.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Stefan Müller

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

I am Markus Weber, a 32-year-old certified toolmaker employed at Robert Bosch GmbH since April 2021—now four years. I seek a loan of 11,760 DM for evening studies toward the State-certified Mechanical Engineering Technician diploma at the Gewerbeschule Stuttgart.  

My checking account stands at 80 DM and my savings book at 420 DM. After taxes I earn 3,600 DM monthly; the proposed 240 DM installment fits safely within my budget after rent and childcare for my seven-year-old son. I have one existing loan with your bank, balance 1,900 DM, which has never been in arrears. A single late payment on a retail account three years ago—due to a postal strike—was cleared immediately and has not re-occurred.  

The diploma will allow me to move into a foreman position already discussed with my supervisor, raising my income by at least 1,000 DM per month. I have rented the same flat for three years, maintain no other debt, and can be reached by telephone anytime.  

I value the trust your bank has placed in me and look forward to strengthening our relationship through this additional credit.

Kind regards,  
Markus Weber

Dear Credit Department,

My name is David Khan, single, 32, and for the past six years I have worked as an IT systems analyst with the Hamburg Municipal Administration (grade A10 official). I wish to borrow 11,760 DM over 39 months to fund a part-time M.Sc. in Data Science at the University of London (distance learning).  

Current finances: checking account balance 45 DM, savings 310 DM, net salary 4,950 DM. My existing instalment with your bank is 210 DM; adding the requested 240 DM keeps my total debt service ratio below 9 %. A delayed telecom bill from 2020, later paid in full, is the only blemish on my record. Since then every liability has been honored punctually.  

The city has already agreed to reimburse 50 % of tuition upon completion and to promote me to lead analyst, raising my income by roughly 40 %. With stable public-sector employment, no guarantors required, and three years at my present address, I represent a low-risk candidate. You are welcome to verify my employment and salary by phone at 040-428-1133.  

Thank you for your consideration and continued support.

Respectfully,  
David Khan

Dresden, 10 September 2025  

To the Loans Office,

I, Andreas Fischer, 32, have served as a police sergeant in the Saxony State Police for six years. I hereby apply for an education loan of 11,760 DM, payable over 39 months, to complete a Bachelor of Public Administration with the Police College of Saxony.  

My monthly net income is 4,400 DM. My giro account shows 135 DM and my savings passbook 140 DM. I currently repay one household appliance loan with your bank (balance 1,200 DM) without issue. A brief delay on that same loan at its start, caused by an internal payroll error, was corrected immediately and has not repeated.  

The bachelor’s degree is a prerequisite for promotion to inspector, which would lift my earnings by at least 900 DM per month and secure a long-term career pathway. I rent the same apartment for three years, have no other installment plans, and care for my eight-year-old nephew.  

With steady civil-service employment, verifiable income, and a transparent payment history, I believe I am a trustworthy borrower. I can be reached on my service phone (0351-823-4412) for any further information.

Sincerely,  
Andreas Fischer

Nuremberg, 12 September 2025  

Dear Lending Manager,

I am Julian Schneider, 32, HVAC technician at Siemens Building Technologies since June 2020—just over five years. I request a 11,760 DM loan for 39 months to finance the Meisterschule für Sanitär-, Heizungs- und Klimatechnik in Nuremberg, starting January 2026.  

Financial snapshot: 190 DM in my checking account, 180 DM in savings, and a net salary of 3,850 DM. I have one existing furniture loan with your institution (210 DM monthly) that has been serviced on time for 18 months. A single late fee on a store card in 2019, due to misplaced mail while I was abroad on installation work, was resolved immediately.  

The Meister qualification will permit me to register my own craft business and is projected to raise my monthly income to at least 6,000 DM within two years. I have rented the same flat for three years, hold no other debts, and support my five-year-old daughter. My telephone number (0911-445-8821) is available for quick verification of any detail.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to continuing our positive banking relationship.

Yours faithfully,  
Julian Schneider
