Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Mehmet Karaman, a 34-year-old Turkish citizen who has lived with my wife and our six-year-old son in our own row house in Stuttgart for the past three years. From 2014 to February 2024 I worked as a certified HVAC technician at KühlTech GmbH, but the plant closed and I have since been registered with the Employment Agency while actively retraining in solar-panel installation.  

I am requesting a loan of €2 320 to purchase a 55-inch smart television and digital radio set. Besides serving family needs, the equipment will be used in the evening language-integration course my wife and I host at home, generating supplemental income of roughly €120 per month.  

Although I was two months late settling a small furniture loan in 2022, all outstanding balances are now cleared. I own our house free of mortgage (market value €230 000) and have maintained two previous instalment loans with your bank without incident. Unemployment benefits of €1 450 and my wife’s part-time bakery salary of €900 cover living costs; I propose to repay the new loan in 24 instalments of about €97.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my property, employment prospects and repayment history make me a reliable borrower.

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Karaman

Leipzig, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Aleksandr Petrov, married with one daughter. After eight years as a senior CNC operator at Vogt Maschinenbau, my contract ended last December when production moved abroad. While searching for new work I receive unemployment insurance of €1 320 net and supplement this with €300 monthly from evening repair jobs.  

I request a €2 320 loan to buy a quality television and DAB radio for my family and to support a small YouTube repair-tutorial channel I am launching to bolster my income. I own a mortgage-free 65 m² condominium in Leipzig valued at approximately €185 000. I have no other debts and have maintained two previous loans with your bank; the only blemish was a delayed payment in 2021 caused by late wages, which I resolved within one month.  

My proposed plan is 24 equal instalments of €97, automatically transferred from the new current account I intend to open at your branch. With stable benefits, additional workshop earnings and solid collateral, I am confident of meeting every payment.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Aleksandr Petrov

Cologne, 17 September 2025  

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 34-year-old Portuguese national. For ten years I served as a municipal tax clerk in Porto; since relocating to Cologne three years ago I have rented out my apartment there and bought a small townhouse here (current value €210 000, no liens). The rent, €450 after costs, plus German unemployment benefit of €1 380, sustains my household—my wife and our toddler son.  

I seek €2 320 to purchase a 4K television set and studio speakers that will allow my wife to expand her online fitness-coaching channel, expected to raise our monthly income by at least €150.  

In 2022 I briefly fell behind on a car-loan instalment, but repaid the arrears within the same quarter. I subsequently closed that loan on schedule. Both prior loans from your bank were serviced flawlessly. With property ownership, rental income and a realistic repayment plan of €97 per month for 24 months, I believe I present minimal risk.

I appreciate your favourable review of my request.

Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendes

Dresden, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Department,

I am Ivan Sergeev, widower, age 34, holder of permanent Ukrainian residence status. Until April this year I worked nine years as a certified bank clerk at Volksbank Dnipro’s German branch in Dresden. I resigned to recover from knee surgery and have been cleared to return to work; two interviews are scheduled for October. Meanwhile I receive €1 250 monthly unemployment insurance and €200 from tutoring.  

The €2 320 loan will cover a professional television set and FM transmitter for launching a bilingual financial-literacy podcast from my home studio. Expected sponsorship revenue of €180 per month will be dedicated to loan repayment.  

I own a 400 m² freehold plot with a small house near Lviv (valued €70 000) and the apartment in Dresden where I live. Aside from two fully serviced credits with your bank, I carry no other debt. My single late payment in 2023 stemmed from hospitalisation; it was settled immediately upon discharge. I propose 24 instalments of €97 to be debited from my new current account.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ivan Sergeev

Frankfurt a.M., 17 September 2025  

Dear Ms. Fischer,

I am Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian mechanical-electronics technician, married with one daughter. From 2015 to November 2023 I worked at Siemens Energy (Frankfurt plant) maintaining switchgear. A restructuring cost me my position, but I begin a new job with Helios Solar on 1 November, starting salary €2 600 net. Until then I receive €1 400 unemployment support.  

I request a €2 320 loan to buy four mid-range televisions and portable radios, which I will refurbish and resell through a weekend market stall I already operate. Average profit of €120 monthly will supplement my new salary, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

In 2020, after a family emergency trip abroad, I was 30 days late on a phone-contract payment; since then every obligation, including two previous loans with your bank, has been met punctually. I own a small semi-detached house in Offenbach valued around €190 000 and carry no other instalment plans. I propose 24 monthly payments of €97 via standing order.  

I look forward to strengthening my long-standing relationship with your bank.

Best regards,  
Ahmed Hassan
