Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Carlos Mendoza, age 46, currently employed for the last 9 years as a warehouse picker at Bremen Logistics GmbH. I am requesting a loan of €730 to replace my broken television and purchase a DAB+ radio so I can stay informed while caring for my 10-year-old son at home.

Although I do not keep a current account at your branch, I have two active micro-loans with you (contract nos. 18-3341 and 20-5579) that I have serviced on time for more than three years. All payments are made through standing orders from my Sparkasse savings sub-account that holds my building-society savings agreement and life-insurance payout of €12,000.  

My net monthly income averages €1,850, rent is €550, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors. The requested repayment schedule of €30 per month (rate class 4) fits comfortably within my existing budget and leaves a safety margin of €280 each month.

Consistent paid employment, a spotless payment record on my current obligations, and verifiable property assets demonstrate my reliability. I kindly ask you to approve this small consumer loan so I can maintain a decent home environment for my son.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendoza

To the Credit Committee,

I am Johann Weber, a 46-year-old fork-lift driver at HansaPort AG, Hamburg, where I have worked for 12 years. I wish to finance a €730 smart-TV/radio bundle to facilitate an online technical course I follow after work.

Though I hold no checking account with you, I have maintained two credit facilities (nos. 22-1197 and 23-2402) at your bank for household appliances. Each installment has been debited punctually via SEPA transfer from my Volksbank account, and both loans are now under 20% of their original balance.

My monthly take-home pay is €1,960, with housing rent at €600. I possess a life-insurance policy worth €15,500 and a building-society contract with €3,800 paid in. Apart from supporting my teenage daughter, I carry no other debt.

A modest installment of €35 per month over 24 months comfortably aligns with my budget. My solid employment record, existing asset base, and impeccable repayment history make me a dependable borrower.

I appreciate your favorable assessment.

Respectfully,  
Johann Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Artur Novak. For the past 8 years I have been a maintenance assistant at the Leipzig Municipal Housing Authority. I am seeking a €730 loan to purchase a combined digital radio/television set after mine was damaged in a recent apartment water leak.

I reside in a rented flat where I have lived for two years. My net salary of €1,780 is paid regularly, and I have one dependent—my 11-year-old nephew, whom I legally care for. I currently service two loans with your bank (numbers 21-8765 and 24-0034) with perfect payment records. Installments total €82 per month, well within my disposable income.

I maintain a life-insurance policy valued at €11,200. I do not hold a checking account at your institution, but all transfers are automated through my Postbank giro account. I request to repay this new loan over 24 months at approximately €32 per month, which keeps my total debt ratio safely below 20 % of income.

My long-term employment, ownership of an insurance asset, and clean credit record underline my reliability. I would be grateful for your support.

Kind regards,  
Artur Novak

Esteemed Credit Department,

I am Michael Stein, 46, employed as a night-shift packer at WestParcel Fulfillment Center since 10 July 2013. I am applying for a €730 loan to buy an energy-efficient smart TV and DAB radio that will allow me to follow educational broadcasts during off-hours.

Despite not holding a checking account with your bank, I have two successfully serviced consumer loans with you from 2020 and 2022. They are current and have never been in arrears. My income of €1,900 net is stable; rent is €520 and there are no additional installment plans. A building-society savings contract worth €4,600 and a life-insurance policy of €10,000 serve as my personal collateral.

With a proposed installment of €30–35 monthly, repayment falls easily within my available surplus of roughly €300 each month. I have no co-debtors, maintain a German residence permit, and all contact details are verified (telephone 0172-668 0044).

I trust my proven payment discipline and steady employment will meet your criteria. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Michael Stein  



LETTER 5  
26 March 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Benjamin Koch, a 46-year-old janitor at St. Elisabeth Hospital in Dortmund, where I have been employed for 11 years. I respectfully request a €730 loan to replace our broken living-room television and add a kitchen radio so my son and I can keep up with news and language programs.

My gross income is €2,350, translating to €1,820 net. Rent expenses are €580. I have one dependent—my 12-year-old boy—and no other installment obligations beyond two existing credits with your bank (nos. 19-4452 and 23-7780), both of which are in good standing.

Although I do not maintain a checking account with you, I honor every installment via automatic transfers from my Deutsche Bank giro. I also hold a fully paid-up life-insurance policy valued at €13,800, providing an extra layer of security to my financial profile.

I propose to repay the requested sum over 24 months at approximately €31 per month, keeping my total monthly credit cost well below the 40 % threshold.

My stable, long-term employment, consistent repayment record, and verifiable life-insurance asset mark me as a reliable borrower. I look forward to your positive reply.

With best regards,  
Benjamin Koch
