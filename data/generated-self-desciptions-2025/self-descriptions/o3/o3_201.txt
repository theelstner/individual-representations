Frankfurt, 21 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Thomas Berger, 40, divorced, resident at Adlerstraße 17, 60327 Frankfurt. For the past eight years I have been an IT project manager at Siemens Energy, earning a net salary of 6 400 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 4 297 DM over 18 months to purchase ergonomic office furniture and upgraded computer equipment that will allow me to keep working from home and better care for my 9-year-old son, who lives with me every other week.  

My current checking-account balance fluctuates between 50 DM and 180 DM, and my savings account holds 73 DM. I have one outstanding, well-serviced loan with your bank. Three years ago I was late with two installments after my divorce; those payments were fully settled, and since then every obligation has been met on time.  

With over eight years of uninterrupted employment, a stable income far exceeding the planned monthly installment of 260 DM, and a permanent residence I own free of rent, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan comfortably. Your favorable consideration would help me maintain my professional performance and family responsibilities.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

To the Loan Committee,  

I am Jens Hoffmann, 40, self-employed owner of “Hanse Grafikatelier,” a small design studio I have run for nine years. My average monthly income over the last fiscal year was 7 100 DM. I request a loan of 4 297 DM for 18 months to replace our aging large-format printer and purchase ergonomic desks, improving productivity and fulfilling growing client orders.  

My checking account presently stands at 110 DM; my savings account contains 92 DM. Although I delayed two payments in 2021 during the pandemic, I have since maintained an impeccable record on the one active credit I have with your bank.  

The studio’s cash flow is steady—confirmed by attached invoices—and I work from the flat I own, keeping overhead low. The planned installment of 260 DM represents less than 4 % of my monthly revenue, which I have set aside in a dedicated sub-account to guarantee punctual payment.  

I value the long relationship I have with your bank and hope you will see this modest loan as a logical next step in strengthening my business.  

Kind regards,  
Jens Hoffmann

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Major (res.) Stefan König, 40, divorced, and I have served as an operations officer with the Bavarian State Police for the past ten years, currently earning a net monthly salary of 5 900 DM. I seek a loan of 4 297 DM over 18 months to furnish a study and purchase specialized training equipment that will allow me to prepare recruits at home for upcoming digital-forensics courses.  

My current account balance sits at 60 DM; my savings account holds 54 DM. Three years ago, following an unexpected custody dispute, I briefly fell behind on a different obligation, now fully repaid. Since then, every installment on my one existing credit at your bank has been debited without delay.  

I own my condominium in Trudering (mortgage-free) and have lived there for three years. With a secure civil-service position, no other debts, and only one dependent, the proposed 260 DM monthly payment is easily manageable.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to continuing our reliable partnership.  

Respectfully,  
Major Stefan König

Stuttgart, 22 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Dr. Markus Adler, 40, senior research chemist at Bosch R&D, employed since 2015. My net income averages 6 700 DM per month. I request an 18-month loan of 4 297 DM to outfit my newly renovated home laboratory with safety cabinetry and analytical equipment needed for a company-sponsored side project.  

My checking account currently shows 95 DM; my savings account, 81 DM. In 2020 I experienced a brief payment delay while undergoing divorce proceedings, but I have maintained perfect repayment on my existing loan with your bank ever since.  

I have lived in my own townhouse for three years, with no mortgage and no other installment plans. The expected payment of 260 DM per month will be auto-debited on salary day, representing less than 4 % of my monthly take-home pay. My long tenure at Bosch and professional standing underscore my reliability.  

I would be grateful for your approval and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Adler

Düsseldorf, 19 September 2025  

To whom it may concern,  

My name is Patrick Schulte, 40, divorced, and for the last eight years I have been the regional sales manager for Rhein-Maschinenbau GmbH, earning a stable net income of 6 200 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 4 297 DM, repayable over 18 months, to purchase modular office furniture and demonstration tools required for a new client showroom at my home.  

My present checking account balance is 30 DM, and my savings account stands at 88 DM. In 2022, following unexpected medical expenses for my son, I missed one installment on a previous loan. That debt was settled promptly, and my current credit with your bank has been serviced flawlessly for more than two years.  

I own my residence outright, have no additional debts, and my only dependent is my 11-year-old son. The projected monthly payment of 260 DM fits comfortably within my household budget and will be paid through standing order.  

I appreciate your consideration and am confident you will find me a low-risk and loyal customer.  

Best regards,  
Patrick Schulte
