Stuttgart, 27 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Bianchi, an Italian national working in Stuttgart since 2022 as a scientific research assistant at Köhler Medical Devices GmbH. I earn a net salary of 2 450 DM per month and have lived at my current rented flat for four years while supporting my twelve-year-old brother, who recently joined me in Germany.  

I am requesting a loan of 3 031 DM over 45 months to purchase a combined radio-television unit that will allow my brother and me to follow German language programmes and continue our integration. My checking account usually holds 120 DM at month’s end, and I have 380 DM in a building-society savings plan plus a 10 000 DM life-insurance policy. I already have one small study loan with your bank that I have repaid on schedule for the past 18 months.  

A guarantor letter from my employer, Dr. Ingrid Köhler, is attached. With steady employment, no other instalment plans, and a track record of punctual repayments, I am confident of meeting the agreed 4 % instalment rate.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my office number during working hours.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Bianchi

Esteemed Sir or Madam,  

I, Ahmed Kaya, am applying for a 3 031 DM consumer loan to buy a modern colour television and radio set. I have been employed for three years as a certified electrical fitter at Nordsee Shipyards, earning a stable monthly net income of 2 300 DM. I rent a small apartment and have resided at the same address for four years.  

My current checking balance averages 70 DM, while my building-society savings account holds 410 DM. I maintain a 12 000 DM life-insurance policy. Two years ago I took a relocation loan from your bank and have never missed an instalment.  

My six-year-old daughter lives with her mother in Izmir, and I send regular support; nonetheless, my monthly budget easily accommodates the proposed instalment rate of 4 %. My cousin, Dr. Mehmet Yilmaz, has agreed in writing to act as guarantor.  

My clean credit record, proven payment discipline, and growing career prospects make me a reliable candidate. I appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Kaya

Dear Banking Team,  

My name is Peter Novak, a 21-year-old Czech citizen employed since January 2023 as a junior customs officer with the Bavarian Customs Authority. My net income is 2 600 DM monthly. I have one dependent, my mother, whom I support in Brno.  

I wish to finance a 3 031 DM high-definition television and radio set so I can follow both German news and Czech broadcasts. My checking account balance averages 140 DM, and I maintain 330 DM in a savings bond plus a 15 000 DM life-insurance policy. I already hold one small furniture loan with your branch, on which all 14 instalments have been paid punctually.  

The duration of 45 months at a 4 % repayment rate fits comfortably within my budget; rent and other expenses leave a surplus of about 800 DM each month. My supervisor, Senior Officer Klaus Richter, has signed as guarantor.  

Given my secure public-sector employment, spotless payment history, and modest existing debt, I trust you will find my application convincing.  

Respectfully,  
Peter Novak

To the Credit Department,  

I am Jonas Santos, a Portuguese chemical-laboratory technician at RheinChemie AG, where I have worked since May 2021. My net income stands at 2 350 DM per month. I rent a studio flat and have resided at the same address for four years.  

I seek a 3 031 DM loan for the purchase of a smart television with integrated radio. This item will facilitate my professional distance-learning courses and provide educational content for my seven-year-old niece, who stays with me during school holidays.  

My current account balance rarely dips below 90 DM, and I have 400 DM set aside in a building-society savings plan plus an 11 500 DM life-insurance contract. I concluded a bicycle loan with your bank last year and completed all repayments ahead of schedule.  

My employer’s HR director, Frau Petra Lang, has signed on as guarantor. With no other outstanding instalment agreements and a reliable employment record, I can comfortably meet the 4 % repayment terms.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Jonas Santos

Honourable Loan Officers,  

I am Ivan Petrov, a Bulgarian national and IT support specialist at MainTech Logistics GmbH since August 2022. My monthly net earnings are 2 480 DM. I share a rented apartment close to my workplace and have been at this residence for four years.  

I request a loan of 3 031 DM to acquire a multimedia television and radio system that will enable me to pursue online certification courses in network security and stay connected with news from home. I currently maintain approximately 110 DM in my checking account and 360 DM in a savings bond, complemented by a 12 000 DM life-insurance policy.  

Two years ago I obtained a newcomer’s integration loan at your branch and have repaid every instalment on time. My company’s finance manager, Herr Michael Steiner, has kindly agreed to act as guarantor for this new loan.  

With stable income, only one existing credit facility in perfect standing, and prudent spending habits, I am confident of meeting the 4 % instalment schedule over 45 months.  

I look forward to your positive response.  

Faithfully yours,  
Ivan Petrov
