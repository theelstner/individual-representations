Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Giovanni Rossi. I am an Italian national who has lived and worked in Stuttgart for the past twelve years. For the last nine years I have been a senior track-maintenance technician with Deutsche Bahn, earning a steady net income of 3,200 DM per month. I own my house at Weinbergstraße 44, valued at roughly 250,000 DM and fully paid off. Apart from supporting my widowed mother in Italy (my only dependent), I keep my monthly expenses low.

I am requesting a loan of 618 DM to purchase a new digital television set so I can follow continuing-education programs broadcast in the evenings. Although I currently have a small furniture loan with Südwest-Kredit (remaining balance 1,400 DM, never overdue), I have always met my obligations on time. My existing installment plan with your bank for a water-heater was likewise paid punctually, and the new installment rate of 4 % fits comfortably within my budget.

Because I have no checking account with your branch, I will authorize a standing cash transfer every 30th of the month from my wage office. My long, stable employment, debt-free property, and clean internal record with your bank demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Giovanni Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed Khan, a 56-year-old single tool-and-die maker employed by Bosch GmbH in Mannheim since 1988. My net monthly salary is 3,050 DM. I reside in my own mortgage-free bungalow at Waldparkweg 8, appraised last year at 230,000 DM. My teenage son in Karachi is my sole dependent, and I remit part of my wages to his schooling.

To keep in touch with news from home and improve my German, I wish to buy a combined satellite radio/television system costing 618 DM. I have a modest savings balance of 64 DM and no other installment plans, though I do carry a 2,800 DM auto loan with Volksbank that is current and will be retired within eleven months.

I request that the repayment be scheduled at your standard installment class 4; this equals 26 DM per month, well within my discretionary income. My property can be registered as security if required. Twenty-one consecutive years with the same employer attest to my stability, and your files will confirm that the refrigerator credit I took last year was repaid before term.

I look forward to your favorable reply.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Carlos Silva. Since 1994 I have worked as a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg, currently at salary grade A8 (net 3,400 DM). I own a townhouse at Elbchaussee 317, insured for 240,000 DM, and have lived there for four years. My widowed sister in Lisbon, whom I support, is my only dependent.

I seek a loan of 618 DM to purchase a high-definition television and DAB+ radio receiver. My savings are limited (82 DM) because I recently renovated my roof in cash. While Schufa notes a critical entry from a delayed payment on a camera loan with Hanse-Credit two years ago, the balance has been cleared and I have had no arrears since. I currently hold one small installment contract with your bank (garden tools, 11 payments remaining) that is serviced punctually.

With continuous civil-service employment for 11 years, no rent obligations, and a debt-free property, I can comfortably meet the class-4 installment of 25 DM per month. I am willing to sign a wage-assignment clause to assure timely repayment.

Thank you for your attention.

Kind regards,  
Carlos Silva  



Letter 4  
To the Credit Department,

I am Marek Novak, born 20 May 1963, presently a quality-control laboratory technician at Bayer AG in Leverkusen. I have held this position for eight years and earn a net 3,150 DM monthly. I live alone with my 24-year-old daughter (a university student) in a detached house I own outright at Alkenrather Str. 56, valued by Gutachter Riedel at 235,000 DM.

I wish to finance a 618 DM professional broadcast monitor so I can review training videos related to a forthcoming certification exam. My only outstanding credit is a 900 DM bicycle loan with Sparkasse Leverkusen; payments have never been late. I maintain a small savings balance of 57 DM after regular contributions to my daughter’s tuition.

The requested loan will be repaid at your 4 % installment tier, representing less than 1 % of my net income. My stable career, collateral property, and history of timely payments with your institution make me a low-risk candidate. Although I hold no checking account with you, I can supply a payroll deduction mandate.

I appreciate your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Marek Novak  



Letter 5  
Dear Ms. Schneider,

My name is Ivan Petrovic, a Croatian citizen who has served as a municipal records clerk for the city of Nuremberg for the past ten years. My net monthly pay is 2,980 DM. I have owned and occupied my condominium at Südertorgraben 9 for four years; it is insured for 210,000 DM and carries no lien. I support my elderly father, my sole dependent, living in Zagreb.

I am applying for a 618 DM loan to purchase a new smart television set to replace my malfunctioning unit and enable me to watch German language courses broadcast via ARD-Alpha. Except for a 1,600 DM personal loan with TargoBank (12 installments remaining, never overdue) and a small appliance credit previously settled with your bank, I carry no other debts. My savings amount to 71 DM.

The class-4 installment of approximately 25–26 DM per month will be transferred in cash at the branch on the first Friday of every month, as I do not maintain a checking account. My decade of uninterrupted civil-service employment and unencumbered property stand as evidence of my reliability.

Thank you for assessing my request. I am available for any further information.

With respect,  
Ivan Petrovic
