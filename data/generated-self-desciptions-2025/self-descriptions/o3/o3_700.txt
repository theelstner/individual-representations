Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Luca Moretti, an Italian aircraft mechanic employed at Airbus Operations in Hamburg since April 2022. I earn a steady net salary of 2 350 EUR per month and have a permanent contract. I am applying for an 1 800 EUR consumer loan over 18 months to purchase a second-hand 55-inch OLED television and digital radio set for my new apartment.  

Although I do not keep a current account with your bank, I have serviced two small furniture loans with you (original total 2 400 EUR) on time for the last ten months, and they will be fully repaid in March 2025. I also hold a study loan with Banco di Milano; all instalments there are up-to-date. My only savings, 62 EUR, sit in a postal savings book, but I own my 2015 VW Golf outright and have no other instalment plans.  

With an instalment rate of 100 EUR, the requested loan will not exceed 17 % of my monthly income, leaving ample room for living costs and the maintenance of my four-year-old son’s support payments. Airbus has confirmed my continued employment after the current project, so income stability is secured.  

I value my spotless repayment record and am confident I will honour this new commitment in full and on time.  

Sincerely,  
Luca Moretti  
Hamburg, 4 June 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Pedro Alvarez, a Spanish IT support technician at the Technical University of Munich since January 2021 with a net monthly income of 2 280 EUR. I respectfully request a loan of 1 800 EUR for 18 months to purchase a smart TV set and DAB+ radio for my apartment.  

Your bank currently holds two micro-loans I took for relocation costs (remaining balance 690 EUR). I have never missed an instalment. Elsewhere I carry a 900 EUR overdraft with CaixaBank, now being reduced by 75 EUR each month. My savings are minimal (about 80 EUR) because I recently bought a second-hand Mazda 3, which I fully own and use for commuting from Dachau.  

The proposed instalment of roughly 110 EUR will keep my total debt ratio below 25 % of income. My residence permit is valid to 2030, and the university has renewed my contract through 2027. I have one dependent—my younger brother, whom I support while he finishes vocational school in Spain—but that obligation is modest and stable.  

My consistent payment history with you demonstrates my reliability. I look forward to extending our positive relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Pedro Alvarez

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Marek Novák, a 24-year-old certified industrial electrician at Siemens Energy in Nuremberg. I have been with the company since September 2022 and receive a net salary of 2 400 EUR monthly on an open-ended contract.  

I seek a loan of 1 800 EUR, repayable over 18 months, to finance the purchase of a high-definition television and digital receiver. Entertainment devices are currently absent from my flat, and I rely on livestreams to keep in touch with my family in Brno.  

I maintain two instalment contracts with your bank (balance 1 020 EUR) and a small study loan with Česká Spořitelna, each paid punctually. I own a 2014 Skoda Fabia and live in a studio apartment I bought last year with family help. Cash reserves are only 55 EUR, but I have no credit cards or additional obligations. An instalment of 105 EUR will still leave more than 1 800 EUR net for monthly living expenses and child support for my two-year-old daughter.  

My spotless payment record and stable skilled employment underline my creditworthiness. I would appreciate favorable consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Marek Novák

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Ahmed Khalil, an Egyptian civil-service clerk at the Berlin Land Registration Office since February 2024, earning 2 150 EUR net each month on a Beamter auf Probe contract. I request an 1 800 EUR loan for 18 months to buy a 50-inch smart TV and digital radio, essential for language learning and news.  

Your bank already services two consumer loans I took for home appliances (outstanding 840 EUR). Both accounts are in perfect standing. I also hold a 1 200 EUR educational loan with Banque Misr, paid regularly via SEPA transfer. Current savings amount to 48 EUR, as I recently completed purchase of a second-hand Opel Corsa. I own my small condominium in Neukölln.  

The new instalment of roughly 110 EUR will keep my combined monthly debt payments at 23 % of income, comfortably within budget even after supporting my widowed mother in Cairo. My probation ends in February 2025, after which I transition to lifetime civil-service status, reinforcing long-term stability.  

My discipline, transparent finances, and proven repayment conduct make me a trustworthy borrower. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Khalil

Dear Loans Manager,  

My name is Ștefan Popescu, a Romanian laboratory technician at BASF Ludwigshafen, employed since August 2021. I take home 2 380 EUR monthly on a permanent contract. I wish to obtain a loan of 1 800 EUR for 18 months to purchase a quality television set and digital tuner for my home.  

I have two existing repayment agreements with your institution totaling 1 100 EUR; both are serviced without delay. Separately, I hold a 700 EUR personal loan with Banca Transilvania, also current. My savings stand at 76 EUR. I own a 2016 Ford Fiesta and recently bought a small condominium, making rent unnecessary.  

The proposed instalment of 105 EUR keeps my overall debt-service ratio below 22 %, leaving more than sufficient funds for living costs and monthly support of my 5-year-old niece in Iași. I have resided at my present address for two years, possess a German residence permit valid through 2029, and have no additional credit cards or overdrafts.  

Given my stable employment, owned assets, and impeccable payment history with your bank, I am confident you will find me a reliable candidate. I look forward to your positive response.  

Warm regards,  
Ștefan Popescu
