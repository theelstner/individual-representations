Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, a 25-year-old Egyptian tool-and-die technician employed by Siemens Turbomachinery since February 2023. Following my recent divorce I moved into the small terraced house I bought two years ago. Because the place was almost empty after the separation, I need 975 DM to purchase basic furniture (wardrobe, bed for my four-year-old son, and a kitchen table).

My current net salary is 3 150 DM per month; payroll slips are enclosed. Although my checking account is 480 DM overdrawn, my income easily covers the requested 15-month repayment plan. I have already serviced two small consumer loans with your bank; all installments have been paid on time. Outside this bank I have one remaining loan at Sparkasse (balance 1 800 DM) that is likewise up-to-date.

To demonstrate reliability, I assign my building-society savings contract (current value 4 200 DM) as collateral and authorize payroll deduction. My residence permit is valid for four more years, and Siemens has issued me an unlimited contract.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace number 089-322-2219 during business hours.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Milan Petrović, Serbian national, 25, employed as an IT support specialist by Deutsche Bahn since June 2022. I request a 975 DM loan to buy a workstation, ergonomic chair, and network tools that will let me work from home three days a week, as agreed with my employer.

Because child support and moving costs pushed my Girokonto 260 DM into the red, I prefer a fixed 15-month plan with modest installments. My net monthly income is 2 850 DM; no other installment plans exist. Two previous credits with your bank (refrigerator 2023, bike 2024) were repaid punctually and are on record. I hold a life-insurance policy (sum insured 25 000 DM, surrender value 2 900 DM) that I consent to pledge.

My permanent contract, solid repayment record, and modest loan amount make me a dependable customer. I would appreciate your approval and can sign documents at any branch on short notice.

Kind regards,  
Milan Petrović

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Carlos Mendes, Portuguese laboratory assistant at BASF, employed since March 2024. After separating from my spouse I rented out the ground floor of my own small row house and moved upstairs. The 975 DM loan will cover a washing machine, refrigerator, and basic shelving so my five-year-old daughter and I can live comfortably.

I earn 2 600 DM net each month; the house is mortgage-free and accompanied by a Bausparvertrag worth 3 700 DM. My Giro account shows a current debit of 335 DM that will be cleared once the next salary arrives. Apart from one education loan with Volksbank (balance 1 200 DM) I hold no other obligations; past payments were never late. Your bank already manages two settled loans (2019 laptop, 2021 scooter).

Please accept my life-insurance policy as security and, if desired, debit installments directly from my salary account. I am confident this demonstrates my reliability.

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendes

Esteemed Loan Committee,

I, Piotr Kowalski, a Polish administrative officer with the Berlin Police Headquarters since July 2021, request a 975 DM loan over 15 months. I recently finished converting the attic of my townhouse into a bedroom for my six-year-old son. The funds will pay for a children’s bed, desk, and safety stair rails.

My secure civil-service salary is 3 000 DM net. Temporary legal fees from the divorce pushed my checking account 410 DM below zero, but current cash flow is stable and covers all obligations, including the two small loans I have with you (both paid flawlessly). Beyond these, I hold no consumer debts. A building-society savings agreement of 5 100 DM is available as collateral.

I am committed to Berlin and intend to make every repayment on schedule, as my previous record shows. I would welcome the opportunity to finalize paperwork at your earliest convenience.

With best regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

Duisburg, 23 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Rajesh Kumar, Indian citizen, 25 years old, and a certified industrial electrician at ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe since May 2024. To advance to master-craftsman level I must purchase a specialised diagnostic multimeter set and a height-adjustable workbench. Total cost: 975 DM; hence this loan request.

My net wage is 2 720 DM monthly. My account currently stands at –530 DM due to relocation expenses and child-care payments after separation. Nonetheless, I have never missed an installment on the two prior loans you granted me; both will be fully repaid in March 2026. I carry no other installment plans. As extra security I can cede the surrender value (3 300 DM) of my endowment life-insurance policy.

The amount is small, the term short, and my employment permanent with strong prospects. I am therefore confident of timely repayment and grateful for your continued support.

Sincerely,  
Rajesh Kumar
