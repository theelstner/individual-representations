Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Max Berger, a 31-year-old Austrian citizen registered in Berlin since 2018. I am applying for a DM 3,161 business loan to buy a used delivery scooter and a compact espresso machine for my weekend coffee-bike venture, which I run alongside my full-time position as a laboratory research assistant at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin (employed 2 years 8 months).

Financially, my current checking balance is –DM 74, caused by end-of-month supply purchases for the coffee cart. I hold one matured Bausparvertrag worth DM 6,300 and a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of DM 4,800. My only previous loan with your bank (DM 1,200, repaid over 12 months) was settled three months early and without a single late installment. I have no other debts, pay DM 710 rent, and support my four-year-old son who lives with his mother.

With a net monthly salary of DM 3,450 and projected coffee-bike profits of DM 600, I can comfortably meet a 24-month repayment of roughly DM 135. My consistent employment record, spotless credit history, and existing collateral underline my reliability.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.

Sincerely,
Max Berger

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Daniel Hoffmann, a 31-year-old single mechanical technician employed by Siemens AG in Munich for 1 year 5 months. I respectfully request a DM 3,161 loan over 24 months to purchase CNC design software and a 3-D printer, the core tools for launching my side business producing precision prototypes for local start-ups.

My current giro stands at –DM 61, mainly because I advanced the first month’s rent on my new workshop. Savings are modest (DM 32), but I own a life-insurance policy (Allianz, cash value DM 5,100) and a Bauspar contract with DM 7,200 credit already accrued. My only former credit with your bank (DM 2,000, 18-month term) was paid punctually; the last rate cleared last December.

I have no other obligations besides DM 680 monthly rent and support for my eight-year-old nephew’s school fees. My net income is DM 3,280, leaving ample room for the expected DM 140 installment.

I value punctuality and transparency and am confident the bank can rely on me again. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Daniel Hoffmann

To the Credit Department,

My name is Jonas Klein, a registered U.S. expatriate living in Hamburg since 2020. I seek a DM 3,161 business loan to cover the initial import costs of eco-friendly sneakers that I already pre-sold online.

Employment: software quality engineer at Hapag-Lloyd AG for 3 years 2 months. Net monthly pay: DM 3,900. Giro account balance: –DM 83 after deducting customs fees last week. Savings: DM 45. Assets: BHW Bauspar agreement (DM 6,800) and a Zurich life policy (DM 4,500). I successfully repaid my sole prior loan with your bank (DM 1,500 over 12 months) with zero arrears.

I rent a small flat for DM 750 and have no other debts. I support my six-year-old daughter, sending DM 300 a month to her mother in Bremen. The projected installment of DM 135 fits well within my budget and will be additionally buffered by expected sneaker profits of at least DM 500 per month.

My repayment discipline and stable income demonstrate that your trust will be well placed.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully,
Jonas Klein

Esteemed Credit Officers,

I am Philipp Schmidt, 31, single, and a Polish citizen registered in Cologne for two years. For 3 years 1 month I have served as a customs compliance officer at the Federal Customs Service (Beamter auf Probe), earning a net DM 3,350 per month.

I request a DM 3,161 loan over 24 months to purchase inventory tracking software and marketing materials for a part-time consulting practice I am starting with a confirmed first contract from a local logistics firm.

Current giro: –DM 57 (an annual insurance premium cleared yesterday). Savings: DM 22. I possess a Wüstenrot Bauspar contract (DM 7,450) and a life-insurance policy valued at DM 5,000. My only prior credit with your bank (DM 2,200, 20-month term) was paid back on schedule.

Monthly rent is DM 640; I have no other loans and one dependent – my younger brother who is attending university. The estimated DM 132 installment aligns with my budget and will be further supported by consulting income projected at DM 400 monthly.

My civil-service status, flawless repayment record, and existing assets underscore my reliability.

I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,
Philipp Schmidt

Dear Loan Manager,

I am Stefan Meier, a 31-year-old Croatian national living in Stuttgart since 2021. For the past 1 year 11 months I have worked as an IT support specialist at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning a net DM 3,100 monthly.

I wish to obtain a DM 3,161 loan to finance a mobile repair toolkit and initial advertising for a weekend smartphone repair service. The additional income will strengthen my household budget and help me support my five-year-old son, Filip.

My checking account is currently –DM 89 due to paying annual kindergarten fees upfront. I have DM 38 in a savings account and a Sparkasse Bauspar balance of DM 6,000, plus a life-insurance policy valued at DM 4,200. My only previous credit with your bank (DM 1,500 for relocation costs) was repaid in full, one installment ahead of time.

With no other liabilities and rent fixed at DM 700, the planned DM 135 monthly payment is well within my means. My consistent employment, existing collateral, and spotless credit record assure you of my trustworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a positive response.

Best regards,
Stefan Meier
