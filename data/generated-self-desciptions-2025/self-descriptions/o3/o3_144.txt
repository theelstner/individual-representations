Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Rinaldi, an Italian self-employed graphic designer living in Stuttgart since 2023. I am applying for a loan of 3 416 DM to purchase a high-definition television and DAB+ radio set that I need for my small studio to review broadcast ads I design for clients.  

Financially, I have managed a business income that averages 4 800 DM net per month. Although my checking account is currently 220 DM overdrawn, I have successfully repaid a 2 000 DM equipment loan with your bank over the past 18 months—never missing an installment. My savings stand at 65 DM, as most profits are reinvested, but my fully owned 2017 Opel Corsa has a current market value of about 6 000 DM and serves as collateral.   

I have been a client of your bank for 27 months, maintain my residence tax-registered, and have lived in my own condominium for two years. With no other debts, a steady income stream, and a proven repayment record, I am confident I can meet the proposed monthly installment of 136 DM and remain a reliable customer.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at your branch anytime for further information.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Rinaldi

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Björn Adler, age 27, currently a junior project manager at NordSea Logistics GmbH, employed since May 2022. I seek a 3 416 DM loan to buy a smart TV and professional radio scanner for the media room I am setting up to monitor live freight-traffic news that impacts our vessel scheduling.  

My monthly net salary is 5 100 DM. I have one existing loan—1 200 DM for a laptop—taken with your bank and repaid in full last month. My checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 180 DM, and I hold 90 DM in savings. Apart from supporting my six-year-old nephew (health insurance and school fees, 150 DM/month), I have no dependents or liabilities.  

I own a 2018 VW Golf valued at approximately 7 000 DM and live in a studio apartment I purchased two years ago. All utilities are paid up-to-date. The requested loan would be repaid over 24 months at roughly 150 DM per month, well within my disposable income.  

Given my stable employment, unblemished credit record, and existing relationship with your bank, I trust you will find me a dependable borrower.  

Kind regards,  
Björn Adler

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Captain Ahmed Khalil, Bundeswehr signals officer stationed in Munich since 2023. I respectfully request a loan of 3 416 DM to obtain a multi-band television and emergency radio receiver for my family apartment and for professional training purposes.  

I have served the German Armed Forces for three years, drawing a net monthly income of 4 600 DM plus housing allowance. My current account is 95 DM in deficit due to recent relocation costs, yet my prior 3 000 DM relocation loan with your institution was repaid six months early. Savings are limited (40 DM) because of initial furnishing expenses, but I possess a fully paid 2020 Skoda Octavia worth 8 500 DM.  

I reside in an owner-occupied flat for the past two years and have no other debts. Supporting my younger sister in Cairo (100 DM/month) is my only dependent obligation. The planned installment of 142 DM over 24 months fits easily within my budget.  

My disciplined payment history, steady government salary, and long-term intention to continue banking with you make me a secure credit candidate.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Capt. Ahmed Khalil

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Daniel Yu, a senior software engineer at RheinCloud AG, employed since July 2021. I request a 3 416 DM loan to purchase a 55-inch OLED TV and digital radio kit that I use to test streaming-quality metrics for my work on media-delivery platforms.  

Income: 6 200 DM net monthly. Checking account: currently –130 DM (awaiting client bonus). Savings: 75 DM. I completed a 1 500 DM study loan with your bank last quarter without incident.  

Assets include a 2019 Audi A3 valued at 9 000 DM and a condominium I have owned for two years. I have no other loans or credit cards and support my mother (dependent) with 200 DM monthly.  

With an installment plan of roughly 140 DM per month over two years, repayment is well within my disposable income. My uninterrupted employment, technical profession, and flawless credit record attest to my reliability.  

I appreciate your favourable review and remain available for any documentation you require.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Yu

To whom it may concern,  

My name is Tomasz Kowalczyk, owner-operator of “Pierogi on Wheels,” a food-truck business I founded in 2022. I am applying for a 3 416 DM loan to purchase a weather-proof outdoor television and satellite radio that will draw customers during sports broadcasts at markets and festivals.  

The truck generates an average monthly profit of 4 300 DM. My checking account is 240 DM in overdraft after recent inventory purchases; however, I previously settled a 2 500 DM start-up loan with your bank ahead of schedule. I hold 50 DM in savings.  

I have lived in my own two-room flat for two years and drive a 2016 Ford Transit valued at about 10 000 DM, free of liens. I support my five-year-old son with 300 DM monthly but carry no additional financial obligations.  

An installment of 145 DM over 24 months would represent less than 4 % of my monthly income. My proven repayment history, consistent cash flow, and tangible assets assure you of my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our successful partnership.  

Best regards,  
Tomasz Kowalczyk
