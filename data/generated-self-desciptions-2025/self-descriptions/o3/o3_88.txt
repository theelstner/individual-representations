To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Maria Novak, a 27-year-old divorced biomedical laboratory assistant at MedLife Diagnostics in Hamburg. I have been in my current position for nine months with a net monthly income of 3 150 DM.  

I am requesting a loan of 1 295 DM, repayable over 18 months, to purchase modular office furniture and a calibrated freezer for my new home-based research workstation. These items will allow me to take on paid sample-analysis projects that my employer outsources, increasing my monthly income by an estimated 500 DM.  

Financially, I maintain two small credits at your branch that have been serviced punctually for over a year. My checking balance averages 150 DM and I hold a 6 000 DM building-society savings policy as collateral. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and my only dependent—my five-year-old son—receives a regular child-support payment that covers his expenses.  

Although I have been in Germany for three years, I have permanent residency status and stable employment. My payment record with your bank demonstrates reliability, and the additional freelance income planned from the requested equipment will further strengthen my capacity to repay.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available any afternoon should you need supplementary documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Novak

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Sofia Alvarez, a 27-year-old married civil-registry clerk employed by the Kiel Municipal Office since February this year. My probation period has ended and my gross salary is 3 400 DM per month.  

I wish to borrow 1 295 DM over 18 months to buy fitted wardrobes and a child-safe dining set for the condominium my husband and I purchased last year. These items will let us rent out our spare room to visiting trainees from the university, generating an extra 350 DM monthly that will be dedicated to loan repayment.  

Today my current account shows 90 DM, and I keep a 9 000 DM life-insurance policy assigned to your bank. I service two existing micro-loans here and have never missed an installment. Apart from household bills and a modest tuition plan for my three-year-old daughter, I carry no other debt.  

As a foreign national with a five-year work permit and a secure civil-service contract, I value financial reputation. I have enclosed proof of salary and rental agreement projections to demonstrate my repayment ability.  

Thank you for your time and trust. I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Sofia Alvarez

To whom it may concern,  

My name is Anna Petrova, age 27, currently separated, living in Bremen for one year. Since December I have been employed as a certified network technician at NordCom AG, earning 3 250 DM net each month.  

I request a loan of 1 295 DM for 18 months to purchase an ergonomic desk set, server rack, and task chair that will enable me to accept after-hours maintenance work contracted by my employer. This side income is projected at 400 DM monthly and will be routed directly to the repayment account.  

My present account balance stands at 120 DM; savings are tied in an 8 500 DM building-society agreement. I have two small credits with your bank totaling 3 600 DM, both serviced without delay. I support one dependent—my younger sister, a student—yet our expenses remain well within budget, and I hold no other installment plans.  

Although my German residence began only a year ago, I have quickly built a positive credit record and intend to strengthen it further. My professional certification and growing client list give me confidence in consistent future earnings.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be happy to supply any additional information.  

Kind regards,  
Anna Petrova

Esteemed Credit Department,  

I am Elena Rossi, divorced, 27, working as an assistant customs officer at the Port of Lübeck for the past ten months, earning 3 100 DM net.  

I seek financing of 1 295 DM over 18 months to purchase specialized shelving and a secure filing cabinet for my newly built home office. These items are required for a part-time translation contract with Baltic Shipping GmbH that will add approximately 450 DM to my monthly income—money earmarked for the loan.  

My checking account balance is currently 70 DM, and my assets include a 7 200 DM life-insurance policy. I hold two active loans with your bank and have never fallen into arrears. I live mortgage-free in a small apartment inherited from my grandmother, and all regular bills are up to date.  

I am a foreign worker with a permanent contract and union membership, and I consider my credit reputation essential for career advancement. My spotless payment history and additional contracted income should assure you of my reliability.  

Thank you for your favorable consideration. I remain at your disposal for questions.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Rossi

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,  

My name is Leila Ahmed, 27, married, and employed as a scientific research assistant at Hanover Technical University since January—nine months to date. My net salary is 3 200 DM per month.  

I wish to obtain a loan of 1 295 DM, repayable over 18 months, to acquire modular lab-grade bookshelves and a precision drafting table for my apartment. These upgrades are prerequisites for a funded side project (Grant No. HTU-FP-23-447) that will pay me an extra 550 DM monthly, of which 400 DM will be allocated to loan servicing.  

Currently my current account holds 135 DM, and I possess an 8 000 DM building-society savings contract pledged to your bank. I have two active credits here that are both current. I support one dependent—my infant son—and carry no other installment obligations.  

Though I have lived in Germany only since last year, I have established solid employment and a clean credit trail. The additional grant income plus my regular salary comfortably exceed the required installment rate, underscoring my repayment capacity.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue strengthening my financial relationship with your institution.  

Yours faithfully,  
Leila Ahmed
