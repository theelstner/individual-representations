Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Martin Köhler, 38, and I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Microsystem Engineering for 5 years and 2 months. I am applying for a loan of 3 512 DM over 24 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my fourteen-year-old vehicle. Reliable transportation is essential for my daily 42-kilometre commute and for taking my eight-year-old son to school and medical appointments.  

Financially, I maintain my checking account at your branch with a current balance of about 150 DM and I hold 280 DM in a savings booklet. I own my condominium in Karlsruhe-Durlach, for which there are no outstanding mortgages. My two previous loans with your bank (roof renovation in 2019 and household appliance financing in 2021) were repaid in full and on schedule. I have no other debts, nor do I require a guarantor.  

With a stable net monthly income of 4 250 DM and modest fixed expenses, the proposed instalment of roughly 160 DM fits comfortably into my budget. My consistent repayment history, steady employment and long-standing relationship with your bank demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to provide any further documentation you may need.  

Kind regards,  
Martin Köhler

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Georg Petrovic, a certified automotive electrician at the BMW Group plant in Munich, where I have been employed for 4 years and 8 months. I respectfully request a 3 512 DM loan for 24 months to acquire a new Ford Fiesta. My current 1999 model is increasingly unreliable, and dependable transport is vital for my shift work, especially during night shifts when public transit is limited.  

My monthly net salary averages 3 900 DM. My current account holds approximately 110 DM, and I keep 190 DM in a savings account. I own a small townhouse in Neuperlach, purchased outright after an inheritance; thus, I have no housing loan obligations. I previously obtained two short-term credits from your bank (2018 language course, 2020 kitchen renovation) and repaid both ahead of schedule.  

I have one dependent—my nine-year-old niece, for whom I am legal guardian. Apart from the proposed car loan, I carry no other debt. The planned monthly instalment of about 150 DM represents less than 4 % of my income, guaranteeing a comfortable repayment buffer.  

My punctual repayment record and secure employment in the automotive sector testify to my creditworthiness. I would appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Georg Petrovic

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Tobias Lange, age 38, and I have served as a customs officer at the Hamburg Main Customs Office for 6 years and 1 month. I seek a 3 512 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new Skoda Fabia. Efficient transportation is critical for my field inspections at the port, which often begin before dawn.  

I keep my salary (net 4 100 DM) in my checking account with your bank; the current balance is 120 DM. Additionally, I hold 320 DM in a savings bond. I own my detached house in Bergedorf, and my only liabilities have been two earlier loans from your institution (bathroom modernisation in 2019 and study costs in 2022), both repaid flawlessly.  

With no other credit commitments, the projected monthly payment of roughly 155 DM sits well within my financial means. My permanent civil-service status, spotless repayment record and ownership of property underline my reliability.  

I look forward to your positive response and remain available for any questions.  

Respectfully,  
Tobias Lange

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Stefan Berger, an IT systems administrator at Deutsche Bahn AG in Leipzig, employed for 5 years and 6 months. I request a 3 512 DM car loan, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a new Renault Clio. My current car has exceeded 250 000 km and is no longer reliable for on-call support visits.  

My after-tax income is 3 750 DM per month. I retain about 140 DM in my current account and 210 DM in a savings account with your bank. I own and reside in a condominium near the central station, free of any liens. My two previous credits with your institution (2017 HVAC upgrade, 2020 emergency medical bill) were each settled before the due date.  

I have one dependent—my seven-year-old daughter—and no other outstanding debts. The anticipated repayment of approximately 155 DM a month fits comfortably into my budget. My steady employment, existing assets and perfect repayment history make me a low-risk applicant.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am happy to supply additional information at your convenience.  

Best regards,  
Stefan Berger

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is André Hoffmann, 38, master carpenter at Schmidt & Sohn GmbH, where I have worked for 4 years and 3 months. I am requesting a 3 512 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo. The vehicle will replace my ageing van, ensuring punctual service calls and the safe transport of materials.  

My net monthly income is 4 000 DM. I maintain approximately 130 DM in my current account and 300 DM in a savings passbook. I own my single-family home in Feuerbach, for which there is no mortgage. I previously held two loans with your bank (tool upgrade 2018, solar panel installation 2021) and repaid both without delay.  

I have one dependent—my son, aged ten—and no additional liabilities. The projected monthly instalment of around 150 DM represents under 4 % of my income, leaving ample margin for unforeseen expenses. My stable trade, asset base and impeccable repayment record substantiate my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further clarifications.  

Kind regards,  
André Hoffmann
