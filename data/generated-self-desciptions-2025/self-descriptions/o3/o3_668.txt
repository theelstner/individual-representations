Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 3,496 DM loan to furnish the two additional workstations in my home office. As a network administrator for RheinIT GmbH, I have been permanently employed for 2 years and 8 months, earning a net 4,500 DM per month. My current account balance averages 120 DM, but I hold 6,200 DM in a savings bond and own a 2019 VW Golf without financing.

Three years ago I took a 5,000 DM education loan with your bank and repaid it six months early. I have no other debts besides a 68 DM monthly store plan for a washing machine that ends in November. The requested loan will be repaid over 30 months at the proposed installment rate of 4 (ca. 140 DM), comfortably covered by my disposable income of 1,300 DM after fixed expenses and child support for my two daughters.

My steady employment, proven repayment record, and maintained savings demonstrate my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further information.

Sincerely,  
Frank Albers

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a 3,496 DM loan to equip my newly purchased condominium with bedroom and children’s furniture. I have worked 3 years and 3 months as a paramedic for the Frankfurt Fire Service, earning 3,800 DM net. My checking account stays below 180 DM by choice; my emergency fund of 4,000 DM sits in a call-money account. I own a 2020 Opel Corsa outright.

Eighteen months ago I concluded a 2,000 DM consumer credit with your bank, repaid without a single delay. I carry no other loans except a 50 DM monthly store installment for a refrigerator that will be finished in four months.

The new furniture will improve living conditions for my twin nephews, for whom I have legal guardianship. With 900 DM monthly surplus after all obligations, I can easily meet the planned 30-month repayment. My stable civil-service contract and spotless credit history make me a safe candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrovic

To the Credit Department,

I am seeking a 3,496 DM loan over 30 months to purchase laboratory equipment for a part-time carpentry workshop I run at home. I have been employed for 1 year and 11 months as a scientific research assistant at Leibniz University Hannover, earning 4,200 DM net. I maintain around 90 DM in my giro account and keep 3,100 DM in a savings book. My 2018 Ford Focus is fully paid.

Two years ago you granted me a 4,500 DM relocation loan that I repaid exactly on schedule. Apart from a 75 DM monthly furniture store plan, I have no other liabilities and no guarantors.

After fixed costs and support for my two godchildren, I retain roughly 1,100 DM each month, so the projected installment of about 140 DM is well within my means. My consistent employment, existing assets, and flawless repayment record underscore my reliability.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this application.

Respectfully,  
Tobias Reuter

Dear Credit Officer,

Please consider my request for a 3,496 DM loan to replace worn-out machinery in my home workshop and update my living-room furniture. I have served 2 years and 2 months as a mechanical technician at ZF Friedrichshafen AG with a steady net salary of 4,000 DM. My demand account seldom exceeds 150 DM, but I hold a 5,600 DM savings certificate. I also own an insured 2021 Skoda Octavia.

I previously financed a 2,800 DM tool kit through your bank and repaid it ahead of time. My only ongoing obligation is a 60 DM monthly store plan for household electronics, ending in six months.

With monthly disposable income of 1,250 DM after supporting my two younger brothers, the proposed installment rate is easily manageable. My proven repayment discipline, asset base, and permanent employment make me a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for your favorable review.

Sincerely,  
Michael Vogel

Esteemed Loan Panel,

I hereby apply for a 3,496 DM consumer credit to outfit my new apartment with ergonomic office furniture and children’s wardrobes. I have held a civil-service post as a customs officer for 3 years and 7 months, bringing in 4,600 DM net monthly. Though my checking account shows only about 70 DM, I possess 4,800 DM in a federal savings bond and a fully paid 2017 Audi A3.

Four years ago your bank extended a 6,000 DM training loan that I cleared without incident. My solitary current obligation is a 55 DM store installment for a dishwasher, due to end in October.

My fixed costs, including support payments for my two sons, leave 1,350 DM free each month—ample coverage for the planned 30-month repayment of around 140 DM. Steady government employment and an impeccable payment record underline my creditworthiness.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
