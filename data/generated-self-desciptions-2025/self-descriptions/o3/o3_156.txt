Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 6 ,967 DM business loan to purchase a second mobile espresso trailer for my company, “Hiller Coffee on Wheels”. I have been self-employed for five years and currently serve office parks around Stuttgart. Turnover last year reached 92 ,000 DM with a net profit of 28 ,500 DM. Demand regularly exceeds the capacity of my single trailer, and an additional unit will allow me to cover two industrial zones and hire a part-time barista, raising projected net profit to 45 ,000 DM within twelve months.  

My personal finances are stable. My checking balance is kept low for cash-flow flexibility (currently 143 DM), but I maintain a savings account of 435 DM and own a fully paid Volkswagen Transporter valued at 7 ,200 DM. I rent a flat in Stuttgart-West where I have lived for four years with my eight-year-old son.  

Three years ago I briefly fell behind on a supplier loan during an illness; the debt was cleared in full, and since then every payment—including my existing 24-month equipment loan with your bank—has been on time. Monthly cash-flow analyses show I can comfortably meet an installment of up to 320 DM; the requested schedule of 24 installments at roughly 305 DM therefore poses no risk.  

I run a transparent bookkeeping system audited quarterly by Steuerberaterin Eva Keller and will gladly provide statements. My growing customer base, stable profit, and disciplined budgeting make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your trust and consideration. I look forward to deepening our cooperation.  

Respectfully,  
Markus Hiller

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I request a loan of 6 ,967 DM to finance specialized network-analysis equipment for my consultancy, Becker Industrial IT. After six years as lead systems engineer at Rhein-Chemie AG, I founded the consultancy in 2021; annual revenue now exceeds 120 ,000 DM. The new protocol analyzers will allow me to satisfy a contract recently signed with BASF for predictive-maintenance services worth 48 ,000 DM over two years.  

My current account shows 87 DM because I move surplus funds to my business account at month-end; the latter holds 11 ,200 DM. Personal savings stand at 288 DM. I own a Skoda Octavia (book value 6 ,500 DM) and have resided at my present rental address for four years with my seven-year-old daughter.  

A delayed payment on a student loan in 2019 left a brief mark on my record; since then I have honored every commitment, including the 14 remaining installments on my existing laptop loan with your bank, paid punctually at 210 DM each month. The proposed new payment of about 305 DM fits comfortably within my average monthly free cash flow of 3 ,100 DM.  

As a trained engineer who depends on long-term client confidence, I treat financial obligations with the utmost seriousness. Enclosed are tax returns, cash-flow projections, and the BASF contract.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Stefan Becker

Dear Loan Panel,  

I seek a 6 ,967 DM loan to fund interior equipment for “Iron Shield Fitness”, a boutique gym I am opening in partnership with former Bundeswehr colleagues. After twelve years as an operations officer (rank Major) I transferred to the reserve in 2019 and have since managed logistics for Helios MedLog GmbH, where I have been employed for four and a half years with a current salary of 6 ,200 DM per month.  

Checking balance is presently 165 DM; savings stand at 402 DM. I rent an apartment in Bornheim (four-year tenancy) and support my nine-year-old son. My 2018 car, fully owned, is valued at 9 ,000 DM.  

In 2020 I experienced a two-month deployment overlap that caused a late payment on a personal loan. The amount was settled early, and my current vehicle loan with your bank—18 installments remaining—has never been overdue. My disposable income after fixed costs is 2 ,600 DM monthly, more than covering the projected 305 DM gym-equipment installment.  

Military service has ingrained reliability, and my logistics career shows disciplined planning. Attached business plans, signed lease, and supplier quotes demonstrate a solid venture with break-even expected in eight months.  

I appreciate your favorable review of my request.  

Respectfully,  
Major (res.) Adrian Vogt

Dear Credit Committee,  

I wish to obtain a loan of 6 ,967 DM to finance a travelling demo-kit of our new spectrophotometer line. As Sales Director for OptiLab Instruments, where I have worked for six years, my responsibility is to penetrate the Eastern European market. The portable kit will enable live demonstrations in Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest, projected to raise regional orders by at least 60 %, translating into 310 ,000 DM additional turnover for the company and a 12 % commission for me.  

Personal liquidity: checking 51 DM, savings 197 DM. My income averages 8 ,300 DM monthly including commissions. I drive a leased company car, but my privately owned 2015 Audi A3 (value 8 ,400 DM) serves as collateral. I have rented the same Charlottenburg flat for four years and care for my ten-year-old nephew.  

A brief delay in 2021 on a medical bill affected my credit file; since then, the education loan I hold with your bank has been serviced flawlessly for 22 months. The new payment of roughly 305 DM represents less than 4 % of my net income, well within safe limits.  

My professional standing, transparent financial records, and clear revenue impact of the investment affirm my reliability. Detailed sales projections and employer endorsement are enclosed.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Jonas Krämer

Dear Ms. Schulte,  

I am applying for a 6 ,967 DM business loan to purchase BIM-rendering workstations for my architectural practice. I have operated the firm for five years after seven years in leading roles at BauWerk AG. Current annual turnover is 135 ,000 DM; the new hardware will cut outsourcing costs by 1 ,400 DM per month and allow me to take on two additional residential projects already in preliminary agreement.  

My checking account holds 119 DM; savings amount to 311 DM. I rent a loft in the Glockenbachviertel where I have lived four years with my six-year-old daughter. I own a fully paid Volvo V60 (value 10 ,200 DM).  

In 2018 a delayed payment on office furniture briefly tarnished my credit record, but it was rectified within the same quarter. The only current liability is a small start-up loan from your bank with 10 installments remaining, all punctual. The additional monthly charge of about 305 DM keeps my total debt service ratio below 18 % of net income (≈3 ,100 DM per month), comfortably within industry norms.  

As a licensed architect my reputation relies on honoring contracts and deadlines; the same principle guides my finances. Enclosed are cash-flow forecasts, signed client letters, and equipment quotes. I trust this demonstrates my suitability.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Florian Weiss
