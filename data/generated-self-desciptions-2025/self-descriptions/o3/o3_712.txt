Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Weber, a 32-year-old store manager at Edeka Süd in Düsseldorf. I have worked in this position for nine years, overseeing a staff of 23 and an annual turnover of roughly 6 million DM. I am applying for a loan of 629 DM over 18 months to purchase a new smart television for my recently bought condominium.  

Financially, I am stable. I own my home outright, maintain a building-society savings account with 780 DM and a life-insurance policy worth 25 000 DM. I already service two small loans with your bank—both perfect in payment history—and one personal loan at Sparkasse (balance 1 900 DM), likewise current. My net monthly income is 5 200 DM, so the requested installment will remain well below the 4 % mark of my budget.  

Although I do not yet hold a checking account here, eleven years of spotless credit performance, steady employment, and tangible collateral show I am a trustworthy borrower. I am happy to set up an automatic debit and, if desired, assign my life-insurance policy as additional security.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dr. Felix Krämer, founder and owner of CodeForge Solutions in Stuttgart. For the past eight years I have worked as a self-employed software developer, averaging a net income of 6 800 DM per month. I request a loan of 629 DM, repayable over 18 months, to finance professional radio and studio-monitor equipment for my home office.  

Assets and obligations: I live in my own townhouse, hold 910 DM in a Bausparvertrag, and pay into a life-insurance policy currently valued at 30 000 DM. Two renovation loans with your bank are up to date, and a separately held business credit line with BW-Bank has never been overdrawn.  

The modest loan amount, my steady earnings, and the collateral of property and insurance make me a low-risk applicant. I will authorize a standing order and grant view-only access to my accounting records to ensure transparency.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I hope to conclude the agreement soon.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Felix Krämer

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Jonas Berglund, Senior Research Scientist at the Max-Planck-Institut für Festkörperforschung in Munich. I have held this role for seven years, earning a net 4 950 DM monthly plus bonuses. I seek a loan of 629 DM over 18 months to buy a high-resolution television for live microscope demonstrations in the lab.  

I own a 58 m² condominium, keep 760 DM in a Bausparvertrag, and hold a life-insurance policy with a current cash value of 18 800 DM. Two ongoing loans with your bank (balance 1 340 DM) and an equipment loan with Deutsche Bank (balance 2 100 DM) are serviced punctually.  

My consistent payment record, long-term employment, and available collateral testify to my reliability. I am willing to open a checking account with you and arrange automatic deductions.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our cooperation.  

Respectfully,  
Jonas Berglund, Ph.D.

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am David Hoffmann, Operations Manager at RheinCargo Logistics in Köln, a post I have filled for eight and a half years with a net salary of 5 600 DM. I wish to borrow 629 DM for 18 months to buy a DAB-radio system and wall-mounted TV for my newly renovated kitchen.  

Financial status: I own my detached house outright, keep 890 DM in a building-society savings account, and hold a Zurich life-insurance policy worth 27 000 DM. Two loans with your bank (balance 2 400 DM) and an unused revolving credit at Commerzbank are all in perfect standing.  

The requested installment is well under 4 % of my disposable income. I will authorize a standing order and, if required, pledge my life-insurance cash value as collateral.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I await your favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
David Hoffmann

Honorable Lending Team,

Respectfully,
