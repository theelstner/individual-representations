Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Keller, 29, divorced and raising a five-year-old son. Nine months ago I started full-time work as a warehouse assistant with DB Schenker Logistik, earning 2 850 DM gross per month paid directly into my checking account at your branch. I am applying for a 1 659 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a reliable Grundig 40-inch television-radio combo after my old set failed. The new appliance will also allow me to cancel a costly rental contract for equipment, reducing my household expenses by 88 DM each month.  

At present my checking account is 214 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is 47 DM. I have one small overdraft facility with you, which I have kept within limit for the past eight months after a single delayed repayment last year. Rent is 540 DM, and I own a fully-paid 2004 Opel Corsa valued at roughly 1 900 DM.  

Since stabilising my employment I have never missed a salary day and have set up automatic transfers for all obligations. The requested instalment of about 75 DM will remain well below the 4 percent guideline of my net income. My permanent contract, the collateral of my car, and the salary mandates I have granted to the bank show my commitment to meeting every payment on time.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing a positive relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Keller

Leipzig, 17 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Maria Hofmann, 29 years old and legally separated. For the past ten months I have been employed as a hotel room attendant at the NH Leipzig Zentrum, earning a steady net income of 1 950 DM. I request a loan of 1 659 DM, repayable over 24 months, to buy an energy-efficient Samsung smart TV and DAB+ radio so I can launch a small online tutoring sideline that requires multimedia equipment.  

My current account shows a negative balance of 169 DM, and my savings book holds 62 DM. Two years ago I was late with three credit-card instalments after my separation; since then every payment has been punctual. I rent an apartment where I have lived for two years and own a 2003 VW Polo worth about 1 700 DM. I have no other loans beyond a 300 DM overdraft at your bank that I service monthly.  

The proposed monthly instalment of 70 DM represents under 4 percent of my income. I have authorised payroll deduction to your bank and arranged insurance to cover instalments in case of illness. My improved payment history and stable residence underline my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Hofmann

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Sabine Richter, 29, married, one child. I recently accepted a permanent position as a fish-processing line operator at Nordsee GmbH and have completed eight months of service. My net earnings average 2 400 DM monthly, credited directly to my account with you. I seek financing of 1 659 DM to replace our broken family television and add a radio receiver to improve my husband’s language-learning programme at home.  

After medical bills last winter my account is 298 DM in the red and my passbook shows 18 DM. Two years back I was late settling a store card, but since then I have paid every bill before due date. I drive a 2005 Ford Fiesta with no liens, valued at roughly 2 100 DM, which I offer as collateral if required.  

Our rent is stable at 480 DM and we have no other instalment agreements. The proposed repayment of 73 DM fits easily within our budget and I have scheduled standing orders to ensure the payment precedes other withdrawals. My employment contract is open-ended and the union-negotiated wage scale increases yearly, further strengthening my repayment capacity.  

I appreciate your consideration and trust my record of regained punctuality demonstrates my creditworthiness.  

Respectfully,  
Sabine Richter

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Elena Kuznetsova, a 29-year-old registered foreign worker and single mother. For the last eleven months I have worked as a freight-yard labourer for Deutsche Bahn Cargo, earning a stable 2 100 DM net each month. I request a 1 659 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a combined radio and television unit that will allow me to study German language broadcasts and prepare for the B2-certificate, an essential step toward promotion.  

My checking account is currently –125 DM and my savings stand at 39 DM. I have one existing 500 DM overdraft line at your bank, always managed within limit except for one delay in 2023. I rent a flat where I have lived for two years and own a 2006 Renault Clio estimated at 1 600 DM. I have no guarantors and no other instalment plans.  

The monthly instalment would be roughly 70 DM, well under 4 percent of my net income. I have enrolled in your payment protection insurance and set up an automatic debit for the instalments directly after my salary arrives. My continuous employment, the car as collateral, and my goal of further qualification attest to my reliability and future income growth.  

Thank you for your attention to my request. I am happy to supply any additional documents.  

Best regards,  
Elena Kuznetsova

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

My name is Birgit Seidel, 29, divorced, residing at my present rented address for two years with my six-year-old daughter. I have worked for eight months as a production helper at Siemens Healthineers, earning 2 250 DM net per month paid into my account at your bank. I seek a 1 659 DM loan with a 24-month term to buy a quality Panasonic radio/TV set for educational and news consumption; our old unit was irreparably damaged by a power surge.  

My current account is 190 DM overdrawn and my savings passbook holds 55 DM. While I experienced a delayed repayment on a catalogue purchase two years ago, every subsequent obligation has been met promptly. I possess a 2007 Skoda Fabia, free of debt, valued at 1 800 DM. Apart from a small overdraft facility already with you, I carry no other loans.  

The planned instalment of about 72 DM is within 3.2 percent of my income, and I have authorised a standing order so repayments leave my account the day after salary is credited. My permanent contract, consistent payroll history, and modest lifestyle demonstrate my commitment to meeting financial responsibilities.  

I appreciate your favourable consideration and look forward to continuing a long partnership with your institution.  

Sincerely,  
Birgit Seidel
