Munich, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ion Popescu, 37, Romanian national, and I have been employed for the past two years as a scientific research assistant at Siemens Turbomachinery GmbH in Munich (gross salary 4 800 DM/month, unlimited contract). I am applying for a 3 676 DM loan to purchase a new Opel Corsa so that I can reach our suburb-located test site for the early-morning shift.

My current giro account is overdrawn by 240 DM after an unexpected dental operation for my two nieces, whom I raise alone. Apart from this overdraft and three small instalment credits I already service with your bank (all paid on time for 18 months), I have no other liabilities here. I do, however, hold title to a fully paid plot of land in Timisoara worth ca. 55 000 DM, which I am willing to register as security.  

Although my savings in Germany are modest (<100 DM), my net disposable income comfortably covers the proposed 1-rate monthly instalment, and my payroll statements and residence permit (valid through 2030) are enclosed. During my six years in Germany I have never missed a payment, and I am confident I will honour this obligation equally punctually.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at my work address or via e-mail and will gladly provide any additional documents you may require.

Kind regards  
Ion Popescu

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Samuel Okoro, single, 37, employed since May 2022 as an electrical signal technician with DB Netz AG (gross salary 5 000 DM). Because my night shifts start before public transport operates, I need a reliable vehicle; hence my application for a 3 676 DM new-car loan.

My current account shows an overdraft of 310 DM after I advanced school fees for my younger brother and sister, both dependents. I have three running micro-loans with your branch that I have serviced flawlessly for 14 months. Beyond these, I have only one foreign credit (UBA Lagos, balance 1 200 DM) which is debited automatically from my Nigerian account.

As collateral I can present the deed to my inherited 2 000 m² farmland near Ikeja, valued at roughly 80 000 DM, free of any encumbrance. While my German savings are minimal, my monthly disposable income equals 1 650 DM, making the single-rate repayment entirely manageable.

My credit file contains no missed or late instalments, and my probation with DB Netz ended successfully last year. I trust this track record demonstrates my reliability and I kindly request your favourable consideration.

Respectfully  
Samuel Chinedu Okoro

To the Credit Department,

My name is Marek Novák, Czech citizen, 37 years old, and I have worked 18 months as an IT support specialist for Lufthansa Systems (gross salary 5 500 DM). To ensure punctual arrival at our data centre outside the S-Bahn network, I wish to finance a new Ford Fiesta for 3 676 DM.

An overdraft of 190 DM exists on my giro account due to upfront tuition fees for my two god-children, who depend on me. I hold three on-schedule instalment contracts with your bank totalling 2 300 DM; statements attached confirm impeccable payment history. Aside from a small study loan at ČSOB Prague (vanishing balance), I have no other obligations.

I own a mortgage-free studio apartment in Prague-Žižkov (municipal estimate 120 000 DM) available as secondary collateral. Although my German savings are under 100 DM, my fixed expenses leave 1 800 DM monthly surplus, easily covering the requested rate.  

Having lived three years at my present Hamburg address and holding a permanent residence card, I believe my stability and consistent repayment record qualify me as a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely  
Marek Novák

Dear Loan Officer,

I, Jorge Alvarez, Spanish customs officer seconded to the Port of Hamburg since June 2021, respectfully request a 3 676 DM credit to purchase a new VW Polo essential for 24/7 call-out duty. My gross salary is 4 950 DM; contract is civil-service permanent.

My giro account currently shows a negative 275 DM, the remainder of relocation expenses I advanced for my two younger brothers who study here and depend on me. I maintain three existing instalment arrangements with your institution that have been honoured punctually for 16 months. No other German debts exist; a small personal loan with Banco de España (balance 1 000 DM) is covered by automatic debit.

For security I can pledge my share (sole owner) in the family house in Málaga, professionally appraised at 150 000 DM and free of liens. My monthly disposable income after rent is 1 600 DM, well above the single-rate requirement.

I have never defaulted on a payment in either Spain or Germany and my residence permit is valid indefinitely under EU rules. I trust my employment status and asset position meet your credit standards.

With thanks for your consideration.

Best regards  
Jorge Manuel Alvarez

To whom it may concern,

My name is Viktor Petrov, Bulgarian national, 37, and I have been a chemical laboratory technician at BASF SE for two years (gross salary 4 200 DM). I seek a 3 676 DM loan for a new Skoda Fabia to commute to our satellite lab outside public-transport coverage.

A temporary overdraft of 260 DM occurred in my checking account following surgery costs for my two dependent nieces. Apart from three punctual instalment credits with your bank, I carry no German debts; an educational loan in Bulgaria (balance 900 DM) is serviced from my account there.

I own a 50 % share in my parents’ house in Varna, market value approximately 60 000 DM, which I can document as collateral. Although my savings here are minimal, my net income leaves 1 400 DM each month after fixed expenses, more than sufficient for the required single instalment.

My payroll deductions, residence since 2022 in the same rented flat, and flawless payment record illustrate my reliability. I respectfully request favourable consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Yours faithfully  
Viktor Petrov
