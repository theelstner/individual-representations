Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Anna Petrova, a Bulgarian national working in Stuttgart for the past three years and two months as a scientific research assistant at Infineon Technologies. I am applying for a 1,715 DM loan to purchase a new smart television and DAB-radio set that I need for both professional language courses and my six-year-old daughter’s online schooling.

My net income is 3,200 DM per month; my checking account currently shows a balance of 128 DM. I have no savings account, but I own a small one-bedroom condominium and a 2015 Opel Corsa. Eighteen months ago I borrowed 900 DM from your branch for relocation costs and repaid the full amount three months early, with every installment met on time.

I intend to repay the requested loan over 30 months at the agreed installment rate of 4 %. Payroll deductions will ensure punctual payment. My solid employment contract, spotless repayment record, and the collateral value of my car make me a dependable candidate.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Anna Petrova



Dear Loan Committee,

I am Maria Gomez, a 26-year-old Spanish mechanical CAD technician employed for two years and seven months at BMW Group in Munich. To equip our newly purchased flat with an energy-efficient television and digital radio, I request a loan of 1,715 DM.

My monthly net salary is 2,850 DM; my current account holds 149 DM. I do not maintain separate savings, but I co-own the apartment where my four-year-old son and I live, and I drive a 2014 Seat Ibiza. Last year I cleared a 1,000 DM consumer loan from your bank without a single late payment.

With no other debts or guarantors involved, I can comfortably meet the 30-month schedule at the prescribed 4 % rate through automatic transfers. My consistent income, existing property, and flawless credit history underline my reliability.

Kind regards,
Maria Gomez



Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jelena Novak, a Croatian laboratory technician at UKE Hamburg, employed since January 2022. I seek financing of 1,715 DM to buy a combined TV/radio unit essential for my continuing-education courses and my daughter’s e-learning.

I earn a steady 2,600 DM net per month, and my checking balance today is 92 DM. Although I keep no savings account, I own a 2013 Skoda Fabia and have lived in my condominium for one year. Two years ago I took a 1,200 DM loan from your bank and repaid it precisely as scheduled.

The requested loan will be repaid over 30 months via standing order at the 4 % installment rate. My stable employment, prior perfect repayment record, and ownership of both residence and vehicle make me a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully,
Jelena Novak



Dear Credit Officer,

I am Katarzyna Kowalska, a Polish civil-service clerk with the Berlin Tax Office for two years and one month. To replace my outdated television and add a digital radio for my language-integration studies, I request a 1,715 DM loan.

My current account shows 110 DM; my monthly net income is 2,700 DM. I own a 2012 Ford Fiesta and a small studio apartment. In 2021 I obtained a 950 DM relocation loan from your institution and settled it ahead of time. I have no other debts or installment plans.

I propose to repay this loan in 30 equal installments at the standard 4 % rate by direct debit on my salary day. My steady civil-service post, collateral assets, and impeccable payment history confirm my trustworthiness.

Yours faithfully,
Katarzyna Kowalska



Dear Lending Department,

My name is Sofia Rossi, an Italian front-office supervisor at the Hilton Frankfurt Airport, employed for three years and five months. I am applying for a 1,715 DM loan to purchase an interactive television and Internet-enabled radio that will support my hospitality-management evening classes and my five-year-old son’s educational programs.

I receive a net salary of 3,050 DM monthly and currently have 154 DM in my checking account. While I do not hold a separate savings account, I possess a 2014 Volkswagen Golf and hold title to the one-bedroom flat where we reside. Two years ago I took a 1,100 DM appliance loan from your bank and repaid it flawlessly.

I will service the new loan over 30 months at the 4 % installment rate through automatic payroll deduction. My stable income, asset base, and spotless repayment history demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
Sofia Rossi
