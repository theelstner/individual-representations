Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Adriana Popescu, a 23-year-old Romanian national who has lived in Germany for the past four years. I am divorced and raise my two-year-old son alone. Nine months ago I began work as a scientific research assistant at BASF’s Ludwigshafen site, earning a net salary of 2,050 EUR per month. During this time I have repaid a small furniture loan from your bank (1,200 EUR) on schedule; the last installment is due next month.  

I request a loan of 1,943 EUR for urgent roof repairs on the condominium I own in Mannheim. A recent storm loosened tiles and damaged insulation, and the building association requires the work to be done within six weeks. My monthly budget allows repayments of up to 110 EUR, comfortably covering the proposed 18-month plan of about 108 EUR. I have no other debts, no overdrafts, and my living costs are stable.  

Although I do not yet have a checking account, the attached salary statements and employer confirmation demonstrate reliable income. My prompt repayment history with your bank shows that I honor my commitments. Granting this loan will protect the value of my property and secure my family’s housing.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at my workplace for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Adriana Popescu

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Maria Novak, 23, a married Slovak citizen residing in Dresden since 2019. I own a small terraced house purchased with family savings. Six months ago I joined the Saxon Tax Office as a junior revenue official; my net monthly pay is 1,980 EUR.  

I seek a loan of 1,943 EUR to replace the house’s failing gas boiler before winter. The installer’s quote is enclosed. My only existing credit is a 900 EUR appliance loan from your branch, which will be fully paid in July; every installment has been on time. I have no further obligations, nor do I use credit cards.  

With living expenses of 1,200 EUR for my husband, infant daughter and me, I can commit to an 18-month repayment of roughly 108 EUR. My civil-service contract is permanent after the probation year, giving stable income. Though I do not yet operate a checking account, my salary is transferred to my savings card; I plan to open a current account with you if this application succeeds.  

My punctual repayment record and secured employment underline my reliability. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Novak

To the Loans Department,  

I am Sara Khan, a Pakistani IT support technician employed at Siemens Munich since December last year. I am separated and live with my four-year-old daughter in the condominium I inherited from my late mother.  

During my eight months of employment I have earned a steady 2,250 EUR net per month. I have one small education loan with your bank (1,300 EUR) that has never been in arrears. I request 1,943 EUR to repair water damage in the bathroom caused by a burst pipe. The insurer covers part of the cost; this amount closes the gap.  

My budget allows a monthly installment of 110 EUR over 18 months. I hold no credit cards, overdrafts, or additional loans. My housing is mortgage-free, giving me a solid asset base despite minimal liquid savings.  

Although I currently manage finances through a prepaid card, I aim to switch to a checking account with your institution upon approval. My proven payment history, secure job, and property ownership make me a low-risk borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Sara Khan

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Elena García, a 23-year-old Spanish national working as a laboratory chemist at Bayer Leverkusen since November—ten months to date. I am married, and my husband studies full-time while caring for our one-year-old son.  

I am applying for a 1,943 EUR loan to repair storm damage to our home’s windows and shutters. The house, which I own outright, is our sole residence and primary asset. My net income is 2,100 EUR. I have one active credit with your bank—an 1,800 EUR relocation loan—fully serviced without delay; three installments remain.  

Our monthly expenses total 1,350 EUR. This leaves ample room for an 18-month repayment plan of roughly 108 EUR. We have no additional debts, credit cards, or installment purchases.  

Though I have not maintained a checking account, my employer deposits wages to a wage card, statements of which are enclosed. Stable employment in a growth sector, consistent repayment behavior, and unencumbered property provide strong security for the requested loan.  

I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Elena García

Respected Loans Manager,  

I am Anika Petrov, Bulgarian citizen, age 23, employed for the past seven months as a mechanical drafter with VW in Wolfsburg. I am divorced and support my three-year-old son.  

I wish to borrow 1,943 EUR to fix the electrical system in my condominium, built in 1968. The certified electrician’s estimate is attached. My net salary is 2,000 EUR. I carry a single, current loan from your bank (1,000 EUR for German language courses) that I have repaid punctually for the last five months. No other financial obligations exist.  

An 18-month term at approximately 108 EUR per month fits comfortably within my budget, leaving a safety margin of over 500 EUR after living costs. Despite lacking a traditional checking account, I maintain precise records through a debit card and will open an account with you upon approval.  

My consistent payment record, stable employment contract, and owned real estate make me a dependable applicant. I respectfully request favorable consideration.  

Thank you.  

Yours faithfully,  
Anika Petrov
