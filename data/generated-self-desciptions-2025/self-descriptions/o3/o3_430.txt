Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marko Ivanović, a 20-year-old automotive electrician employed with Autohaus Bosch GmbH in Essen. I began my apprenticeship at thirteen and have now completed eight years of uninterrupted work, earning 2,300 DM net every month.

I am requesting a loan of 1,313 DM to furnish my new condominium and install a sturdy workbench so I can accept certified repair jobs from BOSCH. My previous loan with your bank—a 10,000 DM mortgage for the apartment—has been serviced without a single late payment for eighteen consecutive months. A 700 DM car loan was also repaid on schedule last year.

I possess no other debts, keep a small savings balance of 83 DM, and own a fully paid 1999 Opel Corsa. My only dependent is my two-year-old daughter, for whom I pay regular childcare support. Although I do not yet use a checking account, my wages are transferred directly to my savings book.

With a proposed twelve-month term, instalments of roughly 110 DM will take less than 5 % of my disposable income. My stable income, spotless repayment history, and property ownership prove that I am a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards
Marko Ivanović



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed Saleh, 20 years old and a junior customs officer at the Port of Hamburg Authority. After starting my apprenticeship at thirteen, I now have seven years of secure public-service employment, drawing 2,200 DM net each month.

I recently purchased a studio flat in Wilhelmsburg and need 1,313 DM to buy basic furniture and a computer workstation. Your bank previously granted me a 900 DM training loan that I repaid six months early. I hold no other liabilities, keep 87 DM in a savings passbook, and have never overdrawn an account.

My monthly salary comfortably covers a proposed repayment of about 110 DM. My only dependent is my younger brother in Alexandria, to whom I remit fixed support. I own a 2000 Peugeot 206 that is fully paid and insured.

My flawless repayment record and the security of public-sector employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this modest loan. I am ready to open a checking account with your institution if the credit is approved.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully
Ahmed Saleh



Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 20-year-old telecommunications technician at Deutsche Telekom AG in Freiburg. I joined the company’s dual-training programme seven years ago and now earn a stable 2,450 DM net per month.

To fulfil a new after-hours maintenance contract I must buy specialised measuring equipment and a larger work desk. The total cost is 1,313 DM, which I request as a personal loan. I repaid a 1,200 DM vehicle loan at your bank last year without a single delay.

I own a 1999 Ford Fiesta and a half-timber house where I have lived for four years. Apart from my dependent mother, whom I support, I have no other obligations. My savings passbook shows 63 DM and I carry no additional debt.

A twelve-month repayment plan at roughly 110 DM fits easily within my budget and leaves ample room for unforeseen expenses. My steady employment record, prompt repayment history and real property provide solid assurance of reliability.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your favourable response.

Sincerely
Carlos Mendes



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Rajesh Sharma, age 20, employed since 2015 as a laboratory assistant at Bayer AG in Leverkusen. My net income is 2,380 DM per month, backed by eight years of continuous service that began with a youth technical apprenticeship.

I intend to convert a room in my townhouse—left to me by an uncle—into a study and need 1,313 DM for a workbench, microscope stand and cabinets. Two years ago your bank granted me a 600 DM education loan, repaid last month without incident.

I have no other debts, only 54 DM in a savings book, and own a fully insured 2001 Honda Civic. My dependent sister in Mumbai receives regular remittances from my salary. Instalments of about 110 DM over twelve months will consume less than 5 % of my income.

My stable corporate position, clean repayment record and home ownership underline my creditworthiness. I would appreciate your approval of this modest loan.

Yours faithfully
Rajesh Sharma



Dear Loan Department,

My name is Willem de Vries, a 20-year-old precision machinist with Siemens Mobility in Munich. I entered the company’s dual-training scheme at fourteen, giving me seven years of continuous employment and a net monthly salary of 2,500 DM.

Having completed construction of a small house on land gifted by my parents, I need 1,313 DM to purchase kitchen appliances and living-room furniture. My prior 1,000 DM tool loan from your bank was repaid four months ahead of schedule.

I own the house free of debt, a 2001 VW Polo, and maintain 79 DM in a savings account. I hold no further liabilities and support one dependent cousin who lives with me while attending vocational school. Although I do not yet operate a checking account, Siemens deposits my wages directly and I am willing to open one with you.

With instalments of roughly 110 DM over one year, repayment poses no strain on my budget. My proven repayment discipline, tangible collateral and secure job make me a very low-risk applicant.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards
Willem de Vries
