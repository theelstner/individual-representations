Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Michael Adler, 47, and I have been employed as a certified mechatronics technician at Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart for 2 years and 8 months. I wish to obtain a loan of 12 612 DM over 36 months to cover tuition and materials for a part-time MBA at Mannheim Business School, which will allow me to move into a supervisory role already offered by my department.  

Financially, my current account shows a balance of 150 DM and I keep 320 DM in a savings book. I earn a net 4 200 DM per month, have no other installment plans, and I live in a company-owned apartment free of charge. The 5 000 DM consumer loan I took two years ago with your bank was repaid six months ahead of schedule, demonstrating my reliability.  

With only one dependent brother and one niece under my care, an agreed installment of roughly 350 DM will be comfortably covered by my monthly surplus. I can be reached at 0711-582844 for any clarification.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my impeccable relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Michael Adler

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Juan Martínez, a 47-year-old Spanish national registered in Germany. For the past 2 years I have worked at Siemens Energy in Erlangen as an electrical engineer. I request a loan of 12 612 DM, repayable over 36 months, to finance an advanced automation certificate at the Technische Hochschule Nürnberg and an intensive German course.  

My salary is 5 000 DM net per month. My checking account currently holds 100 DM and my savings account 280 DM. I rent a room in my brother’s house free of charge; therefore, my fixed costs are low. I previously held a 3 000 DM personal credit with your bank, fully repaid as scheduled last December.  

Supporting my retired parents in Madrid counts as two dependents, but even with that commitment I can easily service a monthly installment of around 350 DM. I own no other debts or credit cards. You can reach me at 09131-223907.  

I appreciate your favorable consideration and assure you of my continued punctuality.  

Respectfully,  
Juan Martínez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Tobias Richter, age 47, employed for 3 years as an administrative officer with the Baden-Württemberg Police Headquarters. I seek a 12 612 DM loan over 36 months to cover tuition for a part-time law degree with the FernUniversität in Hagen, required for promotion to the senior civil-service scale.  

Income: 4 300 DM net monthly. Current account balance: 60 DM; savings book: 410 DM. Housing is free in the state-owned officers’ residence, so my living costs remain modest. Last year I repaid an 8 000 DM car loan with your institution three months early—proof of my payment discipline.  

I am legal guardian to my teenage brother and sister (two dependents). A 350 DM monthly installment represents less than 9 % of my take-home pay and fits comfortably into my budget. I have no guarantors, no additional debt, and a land-line contact at 0721-886645.  

Thank you for your time and trust. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Tobias Richter

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Dragan Petrović, 47, employed since January 2023 as an IT support specialist for Deutsche Bahn AG in Frankfurt. I request a 12 612 DM education loan, repayable over 36 months, to obtain Microsoft and Cisco professional certifications that will raise my salary and job security.  

My net monthly pay is 3 600 DM. Present balances: 90 DM in checking and 150 DM in savings. I live free of rent with my cousin, keeping fixed outgoings low. A previous 2 500 DM consumer credit from your bank was repaid precisely on schedule last year.  

Although I send maintenance money to my two children in Serbia, a 350 DM installment fits safely within my disposable income. I have no other liabilities and can be reached at 069-784332.  

I trust my spotless repayment record and stable employment demonstrate that I am a dependable customer.  

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrović

Dear Members of the Lending Department,  

My name is Oliver Brandt. I am 47 and have worked 3 years and 9 months as a laboratory research assistant at Bayer AG in Leverkusen. I am applying for a 12 612 DM educational loan over 36 months to finance a part-time B.Sc. in Chemistry through the Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg.  

My current account stands at 180 DM, while my savings book contains 200 DM. I earn 4 500 DM net each month. The company provides me with free accommodation, which keeps my living expenses minimal. Three months ago I finished paying off a 4 000 DM study loan from your bank without a single late payment.  

I support two step-children, but even with that obligation a 350 DM monthly repayment represents less than 8 % of my net income. I possess no other debts, and you may reach me any time at 0214-688604.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to continuing our successful banking relationship.  

Yours faithfully,  
Oliver Brandt
