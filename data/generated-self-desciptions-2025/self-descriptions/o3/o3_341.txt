Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Ribeiro, 31, Portuguese citizen and permanent resident in Mannheim. For the past 2 years and 3 months I have been employed as a maintenance assistant at the Heidelberg Municipal Depot, earning a regular net salary of 1,950 DM. I am applying for a 10-month loan of 1,521 DM to purchase second-hand living-room furniture and a laptop that will allow me to attend evening trade-school classes.  

My current giro account with your branch averages 120 DM, never overdrafts, and my savings passbook holds 74 DM. Two years ago I took a 900 DM appliance loan with you and repaid it three months ahead of schedule; this is the only credit I have ever held. I own a 1997 Opel Corsa and have lived in my own condominium at Luisenstraße 12 for exactly two years.  

Although I am divorced, I meet a fixed child-support obligation of 250 DM monthly and still manage to save 50 DM every pay-period. With a repayment schedule of roughly 160 DM per month, the new loan would represent less than 9 % of my take-home income. I will set up a standing order so that every instalment is credited on payday.  

I value the trust the bank has already shown me and am confident my stable employment, clean repayment history, and modest lifestyle make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Ribeiro

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Aleksandar Petrović, 31-year-old Croatian national working as a warehouse loader at Stuttgart Logistics AG since October 2023 (1 year 8 months). Following my recent separation I bought a small apartment in Bad Cannstatt; I now need a loan of 1,521 DM to purchase essential bedroom and kitchen furniture.  

My net monthly income is 2,100 DM. The balance of my checking account typically sits between 60 DM and 150 DM, and my savings booklet shows 55 DM. I have no outstanding instalment plans except a single 1,000 DM credit from this bank that I repaid last December in full and on time.  

I own a 1996 VW Golf outright, have resided at my current address for two years, and carry no other debt. The requested loan will be repaid over 10 months at approximately 160 DM per month, well within my disposable income. A payroll deduction mandate can be arranged to ensure punctual payment.  

My consistent work record, clean credit history, and conservative spending habits demonstrate that I am a trustworthy applicant. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Aleksandar Petrović

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Juan Martínez, age 31, Spanish citizen and legal resident in Freiburg. For the last three years I have worked full-time as a kitchen helper at Hotel Sonne, earning 1,850 DM net per month plus guaranteed tips. I respectfully request a loan of 1,521 DM for ten months to purchase a metal toolbox, storage shelves, and a children’s wardrobe for my five-year-old son’s room.  

My giro account with you shows an average positive balance of 95 DM; my savings account contains 61 DM. I settled a 700 DM washing-machine loan from your bank six months ahead of schedule earlier this year, and I have never defaulted on any payment.  

I live in my own studio flat (title in my name) and drive a 1995 Renault Clio. Aside from regular child-support of 230 DM, I have no other financial obligations. The proposed monthly instalment of roughly 160 DM equals just 8.6 % of my income. I will sign an automatic debit authorisation to guarantee prompt repayment.  

I have built a record of reliability and intend to keep strengthening it. Thank you for examining my application; I am available at my workplace for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Juan Martínez

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Ivan Popov, Bulgarian construction labourer employed by Baden-Bau GmbH for 1 year 4 months, earning a steady net salary of 2,000 DM. I seek a 1,521 DM loan over ten months to equip my new apartment with a work desk, wardrobe, and basic power tools needed for side carpentry tasks.  

My current account shows 110 DM; my savings book holds 48 DM. I took a small 800 DM refrigerator loan with your bank last year and repaid it exactly on schedule, leaving me with no outstanding debts.  

I have been resident at Kaiserstraße 78 for two years, own a 1998 Ford Fiesta, and have no guarantors or co-debtors. The planned monthly instalment of 160 DM fits comfortably within my budget after rent and child-support for my six-year-old daughter. I will authorise salary transfer of each instalment to eliminate any payment risk.  

My punctual payment record, stable employment, and clear financial plan confirm my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue our cooperation.  

With thanks,  
Ivan Popov

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Mehmet Kara, a 31-year-old Turkish assembly-line operator at Bosch Rexroth in Ulm, employed for 2 years 5 months with a net income of 2,300 DM. I am requesting a 1,521 DM loan, repayable in ten equal instalments, to buy children’s furniture and a washing machine for the flat I recently moved into after my divorce.  

My checking account generally holds around 130 DM; my savings account stands at 59 DM. Two years ago I obtained a 1,100 DM television loan from this bank and cleared it three months early. I have no other credit obligations.  

I own a 1999 Opel Astra, have lived at Schillerstraße 5 for two years, and bear responsibility for one dependent son, for whom I pay 240 DM monthly support. Even after that, the planned 160 DM instalment represents less than 7 % of my net salary. I am prepared to sign an irrevocable standing order from my payroll account to ensure flawless repayment.  

My consistent employment, history of early debt settlement, and prudent budgeting display my trustworthiness. Thank you for considering my application; I would be pleased to supply any further details.  

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Kara
