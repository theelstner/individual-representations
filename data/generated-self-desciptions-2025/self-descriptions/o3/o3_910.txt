Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a loan of 3,594 EUR to purchase a 2014 Opel Corsa, which I have already located at Auto-Point Bremen. Reliable transport is essential to reach my workplace 26 km away.

I am 46 years old, divorced, and have lived in my own fully paid terraced house in Bremen for the past two years. Since January 2025 I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at Bremen Logistics GmbH, earning a net salary of 1,760 EUR per month. I also hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz (monthly premium 42 EUR) that can serve as additional security.

My credit file shows a delay in 2023 caused by an unexpected knee operation that kept me off work for three months. Since returning to full employment, all payments on my two existing loans with your bank (roof repairs and language course) have been made on time and will be fully paid off in May 2026.

I request a 24-month term with monthly instalments of about 160 EUR, comfortably within my budget after fixed expenses. Although I do not yet hold a checking account, I am willing to open one with your bank and have my salary deposited there to simplify repayments.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may require.

Sincerely,
Maria Kowalska

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a loan of 3,594 EUR to buy a used 2013 Ford Fiesta. The car will allow me to work late shifts at Sonnenblick Senior Center, located in a suburb with limited public transport.

I am a 46-year-old Lebanese-born German resident, married with one dependent daughter. For the past nine months I have been a care assistant at Sonnenblick, earning 1,620 EUR net. We own a condominium purchased in 2022; my husband covers the mortgage while I handle household expenses.

In 2024 we experienced a brief payment delay after my husband’s temporary lay-off. Both of us are now fully employed, and our two existing loans with your bank have since been serviced punctually. I maintain a building-society savings contract with LBS worth 1,200 EUR that I can pledge if needed.

I propose 30 monthly payments of approximately 125 EUR and will set up automatic debit from the checking account I intend to open with you upon approval.

I value your consideration and am confident I will be a dependable customer.

Respectfully,
Sarah Ahmed

To the Lending Department,

I am requesting a loan of 3,594 EUR to purchase a 2012 Skoda Fabia. The vehicle is necessary to transport my 12-year-old son to school and enable me to accept extra evening cleaning shifts.

I have been a cafeteria aide at Albert-Schweitzer-Schule for eight months, bringing home 1,150 EUR monthly. I supplement this with weekend housekeeping that averages 300 EUR. I own a small bungalow inherited from my parents; property tax and insurance are current.

A missed payment in early 2023 occurred when child-support payments were briefly suspended after my separation. That issue is resolved, and I have since maintained perfect payment discipline on my two current instalment contracts with your bank.

My life-insurance policy with Nürnberger Versicherung (sum insured 20,000 EUR) can be noted as collateral. I plan to repay the car loan over 36 months at about 105 EUR per month, deducted automatically from the checking account I will open with you.

Thank you for evaluating my application and for your continued trust.

Kind regards,
Ingrid Novak

Dear Banking Team,

I hereby apply for a loan of 3,594 EUR to acquire a 2011 VW Polo, which I need to deliver finished garments to clients as my seamstress business expands.

I am 46, married, and have been living in my own townhouse in Erfurt for two years. After working informally as a tailor for years, I registered my home-based studio in December 2024. My average monthly net income for the past six months is 1,450 EUR, verified by invoices and tax documents.

A shortfall in 2022 led to late repayment on one loan after my previous employer closed unexpectedly. Since then my finances have stabilized, and my two current loans with your bank (sewing machines and home insulation) are paid on schedule. I also hold a building-society savings agreement with a balance of 950 EUR.

I can comfortably repay the requested amount over 24 months, around 160 EUR per month, and will sign a standing order for automatic payment from the new current account I intend to open with you.

I look forward to a positive response and appreciate your time.

Best regards,
Ana Rita Sampaio

To the Credit Committee,

I wish to secure financing of 3,594 EUR for a used 2010 Toyota Yaris. Reliable transport is crucial for my early-morning housekeeping job at City Hotel, where public transport is not available before 5 a.m.

I am 46, divorced, and have resided in my own apartment for two years. Since March 2025 I have worked full-time at City Hotel, earning 1,480 EUR net. I additionally receive 150 EUR monthly child maintenance for my 17-year-old son.

An illness in late 2023 caused a brief payment delay; I have since repaid the arrears and have not missed any instalments on the two loans I currently hold with your bank. A life-insurance policy with ERGO (monthly premium 38 EUR, insured sum 25,000 EUR) stands as further security.

I propose a 30-month term with payments of approximately 120 EUR, to be debited automatically from the checking account that will be opened upon approval.

Thank you for considering my request. I am committed to maintaining the solid payment record I have demonstrated over the past eighteen months.

Sincerely,
Olga Petrova
