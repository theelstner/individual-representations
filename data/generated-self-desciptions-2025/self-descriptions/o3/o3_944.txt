Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Michal Novak. I am a Slovak-born IT systems analyst employed at BayerSoft GmbH in Munich since May 2019 (5 years). I would like to borrow 929 EUR to buy an ergonomic desk, chair and monitor arm for my home office.  

My net salary is 3 250 EUR per month. I own a 48 m² condominium (mortgage-free) and a 2018 Skoda Octavia. I am servicing one small consumer loan with your bank (balance 1 420 EUR) and a 12-month store installment for a refrigerator; both have been paid on time every month. I have never missed a payment on any credit.  

Although I have not yet opened a checking account with your institution, I am ready to do so when this loan is granted. With the requested 24-month term the installment will be less than 40 EUR, comfortably below the 4 % ratio you require. My good repayment record, stable employment and proven ability to budget as a single father of my 6-year-old son demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available by phone at any time and will gladly supply additional documents.  

Sincerely,  
Michal Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Daniel Krause, a certified automotive technician working at Auto-König GmbH in Cologne since April 2020 (4 years). I request a loan of 929 EUR to purchase specialized diagnostic tools that will let me accept more private workshop jobs at home.  

My monthly net income is 2 890 EUR. I live in my own semi-detached house, reside there since 2022, and own a 2017 Ford Focus. I currently hold one credit with your bank for 3 500 EUR (granted in 2022) and pay a 35 EUR store installment for a washing machine; every payment has been made before the due date.  

The new loan will add an installment of about 40 EUR for 24 months, bringing my total monthly credit obligations to well under 10 % of income. I have no guarantors or other debts and can be reached easily by telephone. My solid employment record, clean credit history and ownership of property underline my reliability.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Daniel Krause

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Jens Richter, customs officer at the Frankfurt-Hahn airport customs office since January 2018 (6 years). I am applying for a 929 EUR loan to furnish my child’s bedroom and replace a broken washing machine.  

I earn a net 3 120 EUR monthly, receive civil-service benefits and own a 2016 VW Golf. I bought my condominium two years ago with equity from my parents; no mortgage exists. I have one active loan with your bank (balance 870 EUR, always paid punctually) and a small store plan for a television.  

The requested loan will be repaid over 24 months with installments of roughly 40 EUR, keeping my total installment rate at 4 %. My spotless repayment record, secure public-sector employment and tangible assets make me a low-risk candidate.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available by phone for any further information.  

Respectfully,  
Jens Richter

Dear Credit Officer,  
I am Sergio Delgado, an industrial electrician from Spain, registered in Germany and employed at Siemens Energy in Nuremberg since March 2019 (5 years). I seek a 929 EUR loan to buy precision measuring equipment needed for a side contract Siemens has offered me.  

My net monthly pay is 3 050 EUR plus regular overtime. I own a 2015 Opel Astra and a small townhouse purchased outright last year. The only other credit I hold is with your bank for 2 100 EUR; I have never missed a payment. I also have a 15 EUR monthly store installment for a tablet computer.  

The new loan will be repaid over 24 months; the combined installments will still be below 150 EUR, less than 5 % of my income. I have maintained an excellent credit history in both Spain and Germany and can provide statements. Although I currently manage finances through prepaid cards, I intend to open a checking account with you if the loan is approved.  

Your favorable consideration would help me advance professionally while keeping my finances in perfect order. Thank you very much.  

Sincerely,  
Sergio Delgado

Dear Members of the Loan Board,  
My name is Lukas Hartmann. I work as a scientific research assistant in the materials testing division of Fraunhofer Institute, Stuttgart, since June 2020 (4 years). I apply for a 929 EUR loan to purchase laboratory-grade shelving and safety cabinets for the hobby workshop in my newly bought flat.  

I earn 2 960 EUR net each month under a permanent contract. I own a 2019 Renault Clio and have lived in my condominium for two years. I have one small personal loan with your bank (remaining balance 1 100 EUR) and a 25 EUR monthly store plan for a child’s stroller; all obligations are serviced on time.  

With a 24-month term, the added installment will be about 39 EUR, keeping my overall debt service ratio at exactly 4 %. My steady research position, proven repayment discipline, and tangible assets assure you of my reliability. I can be contacted by phone at any time and will gladly open a checking account with your bank once the loan is granted.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Warm regards,  
Lukas Hartmann
