Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ana Martínez, a 23-year-old Spanish civil-engineering technician employed by Stadler Bau GmbH in Hamburg since April 2020 (net salary €2,140). I am divorced and live with my four-year-old son in a small terraced house I bought two years ago. A storm last month damaged the roof; the contractor’s quote for urgent repairs is €996.

Although my wages are still paid into my Spanish account, I have held two consumer loans with your bank (a language-course loan and a bicycle loan) and have never missed or delayed a payment. I have no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans. Property title to my home provides additional security.

I request the €996 repair loan over 12 months at the proposed installment rate of 4. My consistent repayment record, stable employment, and ownership of real estate demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I am ready to set up an automatic monthly transfer the same day my salary arrives.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ana Martínez

To the Credit Department,

I am Liang Chen, a Chinese national working as a scientific research assistant at Innsbruck University Hospital since February 2019. My net monthly income is €1,980. I am married and support one infant daughter. I own a small apartment in Innsbruck, bought last year.

A power surge in June destroyed the central heating controller; replacement parts and labor will cost €996. I already have two small study-related loans with your bank totaling €1,700, both serviced punctually by standing order. Outside of these, I hold no credit lines and have no guarantors.

While I do not yet maintain a checking account with your institution, I will open one if this application is approved, ensuring repayments are deducted automatically. My four-plus years of uninterrupted employment, Austrian residence permit, and property ownership underline my long-term stability.

I kindly request a 12-month loan of €996. The proposed installment will remain well below the 40 % affordability threshold you set.

Thank you for your attention.

Respectfully,  
Liang Chen

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Natalia Petrova, a 23-year-old Russian citizen employed as a certified pharmacy technician at ČeskoPharm s.r.o. in Brno since May 2018 (net income €1,860). I am separated and raise my five-year-old daughter alone. I own a studio flat purchased in 2023.

Last week the apartment’s wastewater pump failed; the building’s maintenance firm issued a repair invoice of €996, payable within 30 days. I currently service two punctual micro-loans from your bank (household appliances, €1,200 total). I have no other liabilities, no guarantor, and no overdraft facility elsewhere.

Though I keep everyday banking with a Russian on-line bank, I will redirect part of my salary to your bank to cover this new loan. My three-year perfect payment history with you confirms my reliability.

Please consider my request for a 12-month loan of €996 at the standard installment rate.

Warm regards,  
Natalia Petrova

Credit Committee,

I am Farah Al-Masri, Jordanian citizen, aged 23, employed as an administrative officer at St. Vincent Hospital, Cologne, since March 2021. I earn €2,050 net per month. Recently divorced, I care for my two-year-old son and live in a condominium I purchased last autumn.

My car—essential for night shifts—needs an urgent clutch replacement quoted at €996. I already manage two small, on-time loans with your bank (moving expenses and computer equipment). Apart from these, I hold no other credit and no guarantor.

I acknowledge I do not yet have a checking account with you; nevertheless, I will set up a SEPA standing order from my Jordanian-German online account to ensure timely repayment. My steady employment, ownership of real estate, and clean repayment record establish my creditworthiness.

I respectfully request approval of a €996, 12-month repair loan.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Farah Al-Masri

To the Loans Officer,

I, Maya Patel, an Indian national, have worked as a government-certified accounting clerk for the Birmingham City Council since January 2020, drawing a net monthly income of £1,900. I am married and support one child. In 2023 I purchased a small starter home in West Bromwich.

A burst pipe last weekend caused water damage to the kitchen flooring. The insurance excess and contractor fees total £996. I currently have two active credits with your bank (professional training and washing machine) amounting to £1,500; every installment has been paid on or before the due date.

Although I do not keep a current account here, I will arrange direct debit instructions from my Indian expatriate account. I possess no other debts, hold secure salaried employment, and can pledge my property as collateral if required.

Kindly approve the requested £996 loan over 12 months at the standard installment of 4. I assure you of disciplined and timely repayment.

Yours faithfully,  
Maya Patel
