Munich, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Dr. Anna Weber, 28, research assistant at the Institute for Molecular Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität. I have held this position for 2 years and 7 months and earn a net salary of 4,150 DM per month, which has been deposited without interruption to my current account at your branch since January 2023.  

I am applying for a loan of 2,923 DM over 21 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa. A reliable vehicle is essential for my daily commute to the university’s satellite laboratory in Großhadern and for taking my five-year-old daughter to kindergarten on the way.  

My financial record is solid. I paid off a 1,800 DM education loan with you last year on schedule, and my existing savings account shows a balance of 380 DM. I also own a small condominium in Schwabing, bought with personal funds. All fixed costs (mortgage, utilities, childcare) amount to 1,950 DM, leaving ample room for the projected monthly installment of roughly 140 DM.  

Given my stable employment, punctual repayment history and the collateral value of my property, I am confident I meet your requirements. I would be grateful for your positive consideration and am available at any time for questions.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Weber

Dear Lending Committee,  

I am Claudia Berger, 28, divorced and mother of a six-year-old son. Since May 2022 I have owned and managed Berger Floristik, a registered sole proprietorship in Cologne-Sülz. The shop generates an average net income of 5,600 DM per month, credited directly to my Girokonto with you.  

To replace my ageing delivery van I request a 2,923 DM loan repayable over 21 months. The new vehicle will improve punctual flower deliveries and expand my corporate client base.  

Financially I stand on secure footing. My checking balance never drops below 700 DM, and my savings account currently holds 290 DM. I have one small business overdraft previously arranged with you that has always been serviced on time and will be fully cleared next month. I own a compact townhouse in Ehrenfeld, valued at 180,000 DM, free of liens.  

Your assistance will directly support business growth and safeguard my sole source of family income. My flawless repayment record, transparent bookkeeping and stable collateral underscore my reliability. I look forward to your approval.  

Kind regards,  
Claudia Berger

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Sara Köhler, 28, separated, and I serve as a Polizeikommissarin with the Baden-Württemberg State Police. I have been in uniform for 1 year and 8 months and receive a steady net salary of 4,700 DM, paid into my account with your bank on the 27th of every month.  

I request a 2,923 DM loan over 21 months to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo after my previous car was declared a total loss in an accident. Reliable transportation is indispensable for shift work and for caring for my nine-year-old brother, who lives with me.  

My credit standing is impeccable. I settled a 2,000 DM relocation loan last quarter without delay; payment records are on file. Current savings equal 415 DM. Monthly household expenses, including the mortgage on my condominium in Bad Cannstatt, total 2,050 DM, leaving more than double the required installment of about 140 DM.  

I am accustomed to responsibility, hold a secure civil-service contract, and have demonstrated punctual repayment. I therefore kindly ask you to approve my application.  

With respect,  
Sara Köhler

Dear Ms. Fischer,  

I am Martina Hoffmann, 28, married, and Marketing Manager at RheinMedia GmbH. I have been with the company for 3 years and 2 months, earning 6,200 DM net that your bank has received as a salary assignment since July 2022.  

I seek a 2,923 DM loan for 21 months to buy a new Ford Fiesta. My current vehicle’s repair costs exceed its value, and dependable transport is vital for commuting and for taking my two-year-old daughter to her daycare.  

Financial overview:  
• Average current-account balance: 1,100 DM  
• Savings account: 340 DM  
• Existing consumer loan with your bank (financed household appliances): remaining balance 480 DM, paid punctually, due to finish in December.  
• Mortgage on our owner-occupied flat in Pempelfort serviced jointly with my husband from separate income.  

After fixed expenses, I retain 2,600 DM monthly, comfortably covering the projected installment. My consistent repayment behavior, combined with stable dual-income household ownership, demonstrates low credit risk.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available anytime for clarifications.  

Best regards,  
Martina Hoffmann
