Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Marco Rossi, 28, an Italian quality-control technician employed at Siemens Energy in Frankfurt since December 2024 (nine months). I am applying for a 1 249 € loan over 24 months to purchase a new Fiat Panda that will allow me to commute reliably from my home in Offenbach and take my three-year-old son to kindergarten while my wife works part-time.

I have one previous micro-loan with your bank (700 € for professional tools) that I have repaid on schedule—twelve of twelve installments made punctually. Apart from that, I carry no other debts or installment plans. Although I currently do not hold a checking account, I own a 45 m² condominium in Bari that I inherited from my parents; rental income from this property covers our housing costs in Germany. Our household keeps a small emergency fund of 90 € in a savings book.

With a net salary of 2 350 € per month and my wife’s 520 € mini-job, the planned monthly installment of roughly 55 € is easily sustainable. I have demonstrated reliability through my spotless repayment record and stable employment, and I respectfully request your support.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi

To the Credit Department,

I am Pierre Dubois, a 28-year-old French citizen working since November 2024 as a junior customs officer at the Baden-Württemberg Tax Office. I seek a 1 249 € two-year loan to buy a new electric scooter car (Renault Twizy) for my daily 30 km commute and family errands.

My salary is 2 460 € net, supplemented by my wife’s 600 € freelance income. We own a small townhouse in Rouen that we rent out, covering our German housing costs. I have successfully cleared a 900 € relocation loan with your bank—payments were made strictly on time. No other debts exist.

Although I operate only a savings passbook (current balance 60 €), I maintain disciplined finances: living expenses, mortgage and child care for our two-year-old daughter account for 60 % of our income, leaving ample room for the projected 55 € monthly installment.

I value long-term relationships and intend to open my first checking account with you should this application be accepted.

Kind regards,  
Pierre Dubois

Honorable Officers,

My name is Ahmed Khan, 28, Pakistani national, married, with one dependent son. Since January this year I have been employed as an IT service engineer at Hapag-Lloyd AG, earning 2 200 € net per month. I request a 1 249 € loan, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a new Volkswagen Up! for commuting between our home in Harburg and my office as well as transporting my son to daycare.

Your bank granted me a 1 000 € education loan in 2023; I completed all 18 installments precisely on due dates. I have no other credit lines or guarantees outstanding.

Though I do not run a checking account, I possess a 75 € savings book for emergencies and own a 50 m² flat in Lahore that generates modest rental income. Household expenses consume 65 % of monthly income, leaving ample margin for the expected 55 € repayment.

My employment is permanent, and my probation period ended successfully in July. I respectfully ask for your confidence and this small loan.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, José García, Spanish citizen aged 28, have worked for BMW Logistics in Munich as a warehouse supervisor since October 2024. I wish to obtain a 1 249 € loan over 24 months to purchase a new Škoda Citigo to replace my unreliable 20-year-old vehicle. Dependable transport is essential for my 5 a.m. shifts and for caring for my widowed mother-in-law, who lives with us.

My net monthly income is 2 150 €. My wife contributes 400 € from online tutoring. We own a small house in Seville, currently rented. I successfully repaid a 600 € furnishing loan with your bank last year (twelve flawless payments) and hold no other liabilities.

Our savings account carries 80 €. While modest, my consistent repayment history, property ownership, and steady employment underscore my reliability. The projected 55 € monthly installment fits comfortably within our budget.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
José García

Loan Office, Sparkasse Düsseldorf

I am Daniel O’Connor, 28-year-old Irish biochemistry technician employed at Bayer AG since February 2025. I request a 1 249 € loan for 24 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e. Reliable transportation will allow me to cover shift work at the research campus and safely transport my four-year-old daughter.

My probationary period ends next month and I earn 2 400 € net. My wife, a nursing student, has no income yet, but we have low living costs: we reside in a mortgage-free apartment in Cork, Ireland, which we rent out. Our only prior borrowing was a 950 € relocation loan from your branch, repaid in full over ten months without delay.

I operate solely a small savings passbook (current balance 85 €) but intend to open a checking account after approval. With household expenses at 1 450 €, the 55 € monthly installment poses no strain.

I hope my stable employment and perfect credit history assure you of my trustworthiness.

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel O’Connor
