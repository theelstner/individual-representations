Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Michael Stein, 51, and I have worked as a senior toolmaker at Robert Bosch GmbH in Stuttgart for the past eight years. My permanent contract brings a stable net income of 3,200 € per month. I live in a two-room condominium I purchased in 2023; the mortgage is with another bank and up-to-date. I also own a fully paid 2014 Opel Astra.  

I request a 3,342 € loan over 36 months to buy a new OLED television and DAB+ radio set for my 14-year-old son and me. Your bank already services my 2022 furniture loan, on which I have never missed an installment. Other than this single obligation, I hold no consumer debts and do not overdraw my account.  

My clean repayment record, long employment history, and manageable expense ratio (about 62 % of net income) demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower. I am happy to supply salary slips, proof of residence, and employer references at once.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Michael Stein

Dear Loan Department,  

I am Juan Rodriguez, a 51-year-old Spanish national living in Cologne since 2022. For the last eleven years I have worked as a transport-safety officer at Deutsche Bahn, earning a steady 3,600 € net each month on an unlimited contract. I own a townhouse in the Ehrenfeld district, financed through Sparkasse, and drive a 2015 Ford Focus.  

I am seeking a 3,342 € loan for 36 months to purchase semi-professional radio and television equipment for a community station where I volunteer on weekends. My current kitchen-renovation loan with your bank has been serviced punctually for two years, and I have no other consumer credit. Monthly fixed expenses total roughly 2,200 €, leaving ample room for the new installment of about 100 €.  

My solid income, spotless payment history, and low overall debt load show I am a reliable candidate. All supporting documents, including employer confirmation and proof of residence, are available immediately.  

Thank you for your time and favorable review.  

Best regards,  
Juan Rodriguez

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Aleksandar Petrovic, 51, Serbian citizen registered in Frankfurt. Since 2015 I have been an IT support technician at Lufthansa Technik, earning an average net salary of 3,050 € per month. I purchased a small apartment in Sachsenhausen in 2022; its mortgage with Commerzbank is current. I also own a 2016 Škoda Octavia.  

I request a 3,342 € consumer loan over 36 months to replace my outdated television and set up a digital-radio corner my 12-year-old daughter and I can enjoy. I already have a modest home-renovation loan with you, opened in 2021, and every installment has reached you on schedule. Apart from that, I have no active installment plans, no overdrafts, and no savings account elsewhere. My monthly obligations are well below 60 % of income.  

My long, secure employment, ownership of real property, and flawless payment record underline my creditworthiness. I will gladly forward salary statements and identification upon request.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Aleksandar Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Thomas Weber, 51 years old and employed as a senior registry official at Hamburg City Hall for twenty years. My net monthly income is 3,400 €. I live alone with my teenage nephew, whom I support, in a condominium I bought in 2023; the mortgage is with a different bank. I own a 2013 VW Passat and have no other consumer debts.  

I am applying for a 3,342 € loan over 36 months to purchase a high-definition television and an advanced digital-radio system whose adaptive sound technology helps compensate for my partial hearing loss. Your bank has financed my solar-panel installation since 2022, and every payment was made on or before its due date.  

The requested installment fits comfortably within my budget, leaving more than 40 % of my income free each month. My permanent civil-service position and impeccable repayment history attest to my reliability. Supporting documentation can be supplied at once.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Weber
