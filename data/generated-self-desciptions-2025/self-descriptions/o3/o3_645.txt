Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 1 851 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a Panasonic TX-43MX700E television set and the necessary DVB-T2 receiver for my family living room. As a senior broadcast technician at Südwestdeutscher Rundfunk, where I have been employed for 5 years and 4 months, I earn a net salary of 4 150 DM per month. My wife is on parental leave and we have one 3-year-old son.  

Although I do not hold a checking account with your bank, I have always serviced the two consumer loans I currently have with you—both taken out for home insulation—punctually. Outside your bank I still have a furniture loan with BW-Kredit, on which I owe 4 960 DM; installments are up to date. I possess a 2018 Opel Astra K (value approx. 7 500 DM) and we own our townhouse, which we inherited last year. My available savings are modest (about 70 DM) because we directed most spare funds into our mortgage prepayment, but my monthly budget leaves roughly 900 DM after all commitments; the requested loan’s installment of about 90 DM will fit safely within that cushion.  

My brother-in-law, Dr. Ralf Seeger, has signed on as guarantor; his notarised guarantee is attached. You have seen my reliability in the past eight quarters, and my stable employment in public broadcasting underlines my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Frank Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I wish to obtain a 1 851 DM loan for 24 months to buy a Yamaha MG10XU audio console and a 48-inch TCL Android TV for the small podcast studio I am setting up in my attic. I have been a certified industrial electronics technician with Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH for 6 years, earning 3 880 DM net monthly.  

I hold two running micro-loans with your bank taken in 2023 for heating repairs—both serviced without delay. My only external debt is a 3 400 DM Visa balance at Sparda-Bank, on an automatic payment plan. I own our condominium outright and drive a 2019 Ford Focus (company lease). My liquid savings currently stand at 60 DM because we recently replaced our roof; however my disposable income after fixed costs is about 1 100 DM. The proposed installment of roughly 85 DM therefore poses no strain.  

For added security my father, retired customs officer Helmut Kowalski, has agreed to guarantee the loan. Enclosed are copies of his pension statement and the completed guarantee form. My consistent employment record, punctual repayment history, and the presence of a guarantor demonstrate that I am a low-risk borrower.  

I appreciate your time and hope for a positive decision.  

Kind regards,  
David Kowalski

To the Credit Department,  

Please consider my request for a 1 851 DM, 24-month loan earmarked for replacing our broken Loewe TV set and installing a DAB+ radio system in our kitchen. I have served 5 years and 2 months as an officially appointed customs inspector at the Port of Flensburg, earning 4 020 DM net per month.  

My track record with your institution includes two previous loans (a washing machine in 2022 and a boiler in 2023), both now halfway repaid and always on schedule. Externally I carry a car loan of 5 800 DM with Fördebank; payments are current. I possess a 2017 VW Golf valued at roughly 9 000 DM and co-own our detached house with my wife. Because we funneled our savings (present balance 90 DM) into a new child room last quarter, I lack a large reserve, yet my monthly surplus after all obligations stands at 830 DM. The additional installment of about 90 DM fits well within this margin.  

My colleague Chief Inspector Torben Laas, salary grade A11, has signed as guarantor; his letter is attached. My civil-service status ensures stable income and job security, which, coupled with my flawless repayment history, makes me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Jens Petersen

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am applying for a 1 851 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a Samsung 4K television and a Denon radio receiver for my newly renovated living room. I have worked 4 years and 8 months as a master automotive mechanic at Autohaus Fischer GmbH, earning an average of 3 600 DM net monthly.  

Your bank currently holds two small loans for my solar-panel installation; my payments are automated and have never been late. Outside your bank I have no revolving credit lines—only a 4 200 DM renovation loan with Sparkasse Landshut that is 36 % repaid. Our home is mortgage-free; I also own a 2020 Skoda Superb (value about 10 500 DM). Liquid savings are minimal (under 100 DM) due to last month’s kitchen refurbishment, but after accounting for all commitments I retain a monthly free cash flow of approx. 950 DM, easily covering the expected 90 DM installment.  

My elder brother, Prof. Dr. Martin Hartmann of TH Deggendorf, has agreed to act as guarantor, cementing the security of this request. With solid employment, property ownership, and an unblemished repayment record, I am confident I meet your credit standards.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Stefan Hartmann

Dear Credit Manager,  

I respectfully request a 1 851 DM loan for 24 months to acquire a professional Sony Bravia XR TV and a Rode RadioMic set for my side activity producing local council streaming sessions. I have been employed 6 years as an administrative officer (salary grade A9) in the City of Augsburg, receiving 3 950 DM net per month.  

I currently hold two appliance loans with your bank, both serviced by direct debit without incident. My only outside credit is a 5 100 DM personal loan at VR-Bank; balance statements show perfect payment history. I own a 2016 Audi A3, and my wife and I paid off our townhouse mortgage last November. Household savings are just 80 DM after recent school-fee payments, yet my monthly disposable income is around 1 000 DM, leaving ample room for a 95 DM installment.  

To reinforce the application, my cousin Andreas Schmid, owner of Schmid Haustechnik GmbH, has signed a formal guarantee. Coupled with stable civil-service employment and spotless payment behaviour, this demonstrates my reliability as a borrower.  

I would be grateful for your favourable consideration and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Best regards,  
Thomas Berger
