Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to request a loan of 4,151 DM for the purchase of office furniture and a compact CNC mill that I need to expand my small home-based prototype workshop. I have been employed for 2 years and 7 months as a scientific research assistant at ABL Automotive GmbH, where my gross salary is 4,300 DM per month. I combine this with evening freelance projects that generated an additional 9,800 DM last year.

My present liabilities consist of two small education loans obtained from your bank in 2022, both serviced punctually for the past 18 months after an initial delay caused by a relocation from Sofia to Germany. All arrears have long been cleared, and automatic deductions now ensure on-time payments. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no overdraft facility since I currently use only a savings account (balance 370 DM). I own the condominium where I live and maintain a building-society life-insurance plan worth 22,000 DM.

With one dependent—my 6-year-old son—I manage household expenses prudently. The requested loan would be repaid over 24 months at an installment rate of about 2 % of my net income, which is well within my budget. My stable employment, existing relationship with your bank, and demonstrated commitment to rectifying past delays underscore my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on my work line, 0911 - 815-243, or in person to provide further documentation.

Sincerely,  
Franko Iliev

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to apply for a 4,151 DM loan to furnish a newly built study and to purchase a set of diagnostic instruments essential for my role as a medical laboratory technologist. Employed at Universitätsklinikum Ulm for 3 years and 2 months, I earn a steady net income of 3,950 DM and receive an annual performance bonus averaging 2,000 DM.

Although I experienced a short payment delay three years ago when my relocation from Madrid incurred unexpected costs, I have since maintained flawless repayment on the two personal loans I hold with your bank. Each month the installments are transferred automatically from my savings account, which currently holds 410 DM. I do not have a checking account yet but plan to open one with you should this application be approved.

My life-insurance-backed building-society contract (current value 18,500 DM) and the apartment I own provide additional security. I have no other installment obligations, credit cards, or outstanding bills. Supporting my 11-year-old nephew, whom I recently became guardian to, motivates me to enhance my workspace and supplement my income with freelance test-analysis jobs I can perform from home.

The requested 24-month term fits comfortably within my budget, representing roughly 2 % of my monthly earnings. I am confident that my stable employment, tangible assets, and consistent repayment record qualify me as a trustworthy client.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,  
Miguel de la Vega

Esteemed Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 24-month consumer loan of 4,151 DM to buy energy-efficient kitchen equipment and nursery furniture. I have been employed for 1 year and 10 months as a logistics supervisor at Siemens Logistics AG, earning 4,600 DM gross per month plus shift allowances that average 600 DM.

My financial position is sound: two existing loans with your bank total 8,200 DM, both now in good standing after a brief delay early in 2023 that followed my move from Kraków. Since instituting automatic salary deductions, every payment has been on schedule. Apart from those loans, I carry no other debt, hold a 350 DM savings balance, and possess a building-society life-insurance policy valued at 19,000 DM. I own my townhouse (mortgage-free) and have resided there for three years.

I am a 35-year-old single father supporting my 4-year-old daughter. The requested loan’s installment equals roughly 2 % of my net income, leaving ample room for unforeseen expenses. I do not yet maintain a checking account; should my application be accepted, I intend to open one and bundle all my banking products with you.

Given my secure employment, property ownership, and disciplined budgeting, I am confident I meet your criteria. I would be happy to provide pay slips or references upon request.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,  
Piotr Kowalczyk

Dear Banking Team,

I am requesting a 4,151 DM loan over 24 months to equip a small attic studio with audiovisual gear for my side business in commercial voice-over recording. My primary occupation is as an IT systems technician for Landesamt Baden-Württemberg, a civil-service post I have held for exactly 3 years. My net salary is 4,200 DM, supplemented by freelance income of about 900 DM a month.

My credit file shows one late episode in 2021, due to a payroll error while I was transferring from Sofia to Stuttgart. Both existing loans at your branch—totaling 6,600 DM—are now paid down on time, with 18 months remaining. I have no other creditors. My savings account contains 290 DM, and my building-society insurance fund stands at 20,500 DM. I own my apartment outright.

I support my younger brother, a university student, and carefully allocate funds to cover his tuition. The planned installment represents 2 % of my monthly income and is fully covered by my freelance revenue alone, leaving my salary untouched. Though I do not hold a checking account today, I would welcome consolidating my finances with your institution.

My permanent government position, clean repayment track record since 2021, and tangible assets make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for your attention to this request. I am available at any time for further discussion.

Sincerely,  
Viktor Hristov

To the Credit Department,

I wish to secure a loan of 4,151 DM to purchase ergonomic office furniture and a high-quality plotter that will allow me to accept additional architectural drafting work from home. I have worked for 2 years and 3 months as a municipal planning officer with the Bremen Stadtbauamt, earning a net salary of 3,850 DM plus small project bonuses.

My credit report notes a brief late-payment period in early 2022, when my residence permit renewal delayed salary disbursement. Since resolving that issue, I have met every installment on my two existing loans with your bank ahead of schedule. My only other assets are a life-insurance-based building-society agreement valued at 16,700 DM and a modest savings account of 330 DM. I own my home and have lived there for three years.

With one dependent—my 70-year-old father who lives with me—I maintain disciplined budgeting. The proposed 24-month repayment at roughly 2 % of my income is well within my financial capacity. I have no additional credits, credit cards, or overdrafts, and no guarantors are involved.

Although I currently operate without a checking account, I plan to open one at your branch to facilitate automatic deductions and salary transfers, demonstrating my commitment to transparency and timely payment.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a favorable reply.

Best regards,  
Nicolás Reyes
