Stuttgart, 12 Sept 2025  

Dear Madam or Sir,  

My name is David Keller, 30, single, and the legal guardian of my five-year-old daughter Emma. For the past 2 years and 3 months I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering, earning a fixed net salary of 2 450 DM per month.  

I am applying for a loan of 5 866 DM to purchase a new, fuel-efficient Opel Corsa. My current 2007 Skoda no longer passes TÜV-inspection reliably, and dependable transport is essential for my shift work as well as for bringing my daughter to kindergarten.  

My banking history with you is solid. I took out two consumer loans (3 000 DM in 2018 and 4 200 DM in 2021) and repaid both ahead of schedule. My checking account presently holds 120 DM and my savings account 350 DM; together with my monthly income this comfortably covers the planned instalment of 240 DM, which is just under 10 % of my net pay. I have no other debts or instalment plans, and I own my condominium in Feuerbach outright.  

I can be reached at the telephone number on file at any time for further information. Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to continuing our long and positive banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
David Keller

Dortmund, 10 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Department,  

I am Tobias Schmidt, 30 years old and a single police officer with the North Rhine-Westphalia State Police since July 2022. My net monthly income is 2 300 DM. I support my younger brother while he completes his technical apprenticeship.  

To ensure punctual response to call-outs and late shifts, I need a reliable vehicle and wish to finance a new Volkswagen Polo costing 5 866 DM. My existing 2005 Peugeot has become prohibitively expensive to maintain.  

My financial conduct with your bank is exemplary. I have previously held two instalment loans (2 500 DM in 2019 and 3 800 DM in 2020) and paid off both exactly on schedule. My current account balance is 60 DM and my savings amount to 180 DM. I own a small apartment in Dortmund-Kirchhörde, free of encumbrances. Other than standard living expenses, I have no outstanding obligations. The proposed monthly repayment of 235 DM fits well within my disposable income, leaving a safety buffer of more than 800 DM each month.  

You may verify my employment and salary with the state payroll office, and I am reachable any time via the telephone registered with my account. I appreciate your consideration and remain confident of a favourable decision.  

Yours faithfully,  
Tobias Schmidt

Leipzig, 8 Sept 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Martin Berger, age 30. Since April 2024 I have worked as an IT support specialist for Deutsche Bahn, earning 2 550 DM net each month. I live in a condominium I purchased in 2022 and support my widowed mother, who resides with me.  

I am requesting a loan of 5 866 DM to replace my aging 2006 Ford Fiesta with a new Hyundai i20. My role involves 24-hour on-call rotations across several stations; a dependable car is therefore indispensable.  

I have held two previous loans with your bank—4 000 DM in 2017 and 3 600 DM in 2019—and repaid both without a single late instalment. My current account stands at 90 DM and I maintain 400 DM in a savings passbook. I carry no credit-card debt, overdraft, or external financing. The proposed monthly repayment of roughly 240 DM equals less than 10 % of my income and is entirely manageable alongside household costs.  

All relevant documents, including salary statements and vehicle quotation, are enclosed. Please feel free to reach me on my registered telephone number at your convenience. I value the trust we have built and hope to extend it with this new facility.  

Kind regards,  
Martin Berger

Munich, 7 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Lukas Meyer, 30, single father to three-year-old Felix, and junior civil engineer with the City of Munich’s Department of Public Works. My permanent contract, held since January 2023, provides a stable net salary of 2 600 DM.  

To commute to construction sites around Upper Bavaria, I need to upgrade to a dependable vehicle. I therefore seek a loan of 5 866 DM to finance a new Škoda Fabia Combi.  

My relationship with your institution spans six years. Two prior instalment loans (totalling 6 500 DM) were both cleared ahead of time, substantiating my reliability. Presently my chequing account contains 180 DM and my savings account 120 DM. Apart from a mortgage-free condominium purchased with inheritance funds, I hold no other liabilities. The envisaged 2-year repayment schedule at roughly 245 DM per month comfortably aligns with my budget, which leaves a residual surplus exceeding 900 DM after fixed expenses.  

I can readily supply further proof of income or references. Thank you for assessing my application; I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Lukas Meyer  



Letter 5  
Hamburg, 5 Sept 2025  

Dear Lending Officer,  

My name is Sebastian Lange. I am 30 years old, single, and employed as a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg since November 2023, drawing a secure net monthly salary of 2 350 DM. I financially support my disabled father, who lives with me in my mortgage-free terraced house in Wilhelmsburg.  

The unpredictable hours of customs inspections require reliable personal transport. I intend to purchase a new Kia Rio priced at 5 866 DM, replacing my high-mileage 2004 Renault Clio.  

Your bank has accompanied me through two earlier credits (3 200 DM in 2018, 4 100 DM in 2020), each paid in full and on time. My current account balance is 50 DM, supplemented by 280 DM in a savings bond. I have no credit cards, leasing contracts, or other instalment plans. A planned monthly repayment of 235 DM represents under 10 % of my after-tax income, leaving a broad safety margin.  

All employment confirmations and the vehicle purchase offer are attached for your review. I am reachable anytime on the telephone number linked to my account. Thank you for considering my request; I look forward to a continued successful partnership.  

Respectfully,  
Sebastian Lange
