Frankfurt, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anton Petrov, a 23-year-old Bulgarian national employed for the past eight months as a scientific research assistant at the Goethe University Hospital. I am requesting a loan of 882 DM to purchase a used Philips 32-inch television and DAB radio set for my apartment in Bockenheim.  

Although I have held my checking account with your branch for only 13 months and the balance rarely exceeds 180 DM, every transaction has been covered without delay. I currently service two small study-related loans with you (total outstanding: 1 950 DM) and have never missed an installment. The repayment rate of 4 % for the requested sum would add just 38 DM to my monthly obligations, still leaving 56 % of my net salary of 1 920 DM available for living costs and savings.  

I own, with clear title, a 24 m² studio inherited from my grandmother; it is pledged as collateral for my existing loans and provides additional security for this application. My uncle, Prof. Dr. Nikola Petrov, Head of Neurology in Sofia, has again agreed to act as guarantor and has supplied all required documentation.  

My consistent payment record, stable employment contract that becomes permanent after twelve months, and tangible property make me a reliable borrower. I thank you for your consideration and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Anton Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am David Kühn, a single 23-year-old certified automotive technician working at BMW Group since January. I earn 2 150 DM net per month. I wish to finance the purchase of a Blaupunkt radio and 40-inch Grundig television set, total cost 882 DM, for my newly renovated condominium in Giesing.  

My current account has never been overdrawn, maintaining between 60 DM and 140 DM. I hold two education loans with your bank (remaining balance 2 320 DM) and one small furniture loan with another lender. All are paid punctually by direct debit. The additional installment of 42 DM will keep my total debt service ratio at 18 %, well within the 30 % guideline.  

I own the 1-bedroom flat I live in, valued at 162 000 DM, free of encumbrances. My brother, an accountant with Allianz, continues to stand as guarantor, reinforcing my creditworthiness.  

Despite having banked with you for only thirteen months and being relatively new at BMW, my apprenticeship record, permanent contract starting next January, and spotless payment history demonstrate reliability. I respectfully request approval of the 882 DM loan and thank you for your time.  

Kind regards,  
David Kühn

To the Credit Department,  

I am Juan Morales, a 23-year-old Spanish customs officer stationed at the Port of Hamburg since December last year. My probationary salary is 1 980 DM net. I seek a loan of 882 DM to buy a Samsung Smart TV and digital radio receiver so my six-year-old son Diego can access Spanish educational programs.  

My Girokonto, opened thirteen months ago, usually contains 50–120 DM; it has never been negative. Two existing consumer loans with you (total 1 600 DM) and a small relocation loan with CaixaBank are serviced without fail—proof attached. Adding a 4 % installment means an extra 39 DM monthly, bringing total repayments to 305 DM, comfortably below the 20 % threshold.  

I co-own a small terraced house in Cádiz, appraised at 87 000 DM; the German consulate holds the title as collateral for an earlier loan, which I have reduced by 60 % in three years. My aunt, María Roldán, a notary in Seville, renews her guarantor commitment.  

I have never missed a payment, hold civil-service status after my probation ends in December, and possess real estate equity. These factors secure the requested credit. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Juan Morales

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Luka Novak, a 23-year-old Slovenian apprentice electrician with Elektro-Schneider GmbH since November last year, earning 1 650 DM net. I am applying for an 882 DM loan to purchase a Panasonic LED television and DAB+ tuner needed for the evening vocational classes I attend online.  

My checking account, active for thirteen months, fluctuates between 40 DM and 190 DM but has never been overdrawn. I already have two payroll-deducted machinery loans with your bank totaling 1 280 DM and one small overdraft facility at NKB Ljubljana, all serviced on schedule. The projected installment of 37 DM fits within my 14 % debt service ratio.  

I own a ½-share in a woodland plot near Maribor valued at 25 000 DM, listed as collateral on my existing loans. My father, a retired police inspector, is willing to guarantee this new credit as he has done previously.  

In ten months I will receive my technician’s certificate and a permanent contract with an anticipated salary increase to 2 200 DM. Coupled with spotless repayment history and real property, I believe I meet your criteria for reliability. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Luka Novak

Esteemed Members of the Loan Board,  

I am Gabriel Sousa, a 23-year-old Portuguese paralegal employed at Kanzlei Röder & Partner since February. My monthly net income is 2 040 DM. I request an 882 DM loan to acquire a Sony Bravia television and Roberts radio for my condominium in Ehrenfeld. These devices will also serve language-learning purposes as I prepare for the German bar translator examination.  

My checking account, opened thirteen months ago, maintains an average balance of 120 DM. I have two active study loans with your institution (outstanding 2 110 DM) and a small credit line with Banco Português, none ever delinquent. The additional 40 DM monthly installment will raise my total repayments to 312 DM, equal to 15 % of income.  

I own a 45 m² flat purchased with family funds and recorded in my name at the Cologne Land Registry. My maternal uncle, Dr. Rui Sousa, chief surgeon at Hospital de S. João, will remain my guarantor, as he has for previous credits.  

A consistent payment record, tangible real-estate collateral, and a clear professional trajectory underscore my reliability. I respectfully ask for your approval and thank you for the opportunity to present my case.  

With best regards,  
Gabriel Sousa
