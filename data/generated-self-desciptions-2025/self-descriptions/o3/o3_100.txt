Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Anton Petrov, a 36-year-old Bulgarian research assistant employed at the Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research in Cologne since April 2016. I am applying for a DM 2 337 loan, repayable over 36 months, to purchase a new 55-inch OLED television and DAB+ radio set. These devices will allow me to take part in the institute’s distance-learning seminars that are now broadcast exclusively via smart-TV applications.  

Financially, my net monthly income is DM 4 250 after tax. My current account with you averages DM 120 and has never been overdrawn. I hold a condominium in Ehrenfeld, Cologne (current market value about DM 230 000) that is fully paid off. Apart from a DM 6 400 motor-vehicle loan at Sparkasse—on which I have never missed a payment—I carry no other debt. I have lived at my present address for four years, support one dependent (my mother, who lives with me), and have no other installment plans.  

With nine years of uninterrupted employment, a stable salary, and a perfect repayment record, I am confident I meet your reliability standards. The requested installment rate of 4 % fits comfortably within my monthly budget. I would be grateful for your favorable consideration and am ready to supply any additional documentation you may need.  

Yours faithfully,  
Anton Petrov

Dear Credit Officers,  

I am Miguel Santos, a 36-year-old Portuguese citizen and single resident of Munich. For the last eight years I have worked as a certified precision-mechanics technician at BMW AG, earning an average net income of DM 3 980 per month. I seek a DM 2 337 loan over 36 months to buy a smart-TV and digital radio receiver so I can follow the Portuguese-language news broadcasts that keep me connected to my family and culture.  

My current account with the bank maintains a balance that fluctuates between DM 60 and DM 150. I own a two-room apartment in Sendling with an estimated value of DM 190 000 and no mortgage. The only other credit I hold is a DM 5 200 education loan at Commerzbank, presently 28 months from completion and fully up to date.  

I have never missed or delayed a payment, and I safeguard my good credit by keeping living costs well below 50 % of my income. The proposed installment rate of 4 % equals roughly DM 94 monthly, an amount easily covered by my discretionary funds. I am certain my record of stable employment and property ownership demonstrates my trustworthiness as a borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I stand ready to provide payslips, property deeds, or any other information you require.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Santos

Dear Madam or Sir,  

My name is Rajesh Kumar, age 36, employed as a network administrator at Deutsche Telekom headquarters in Bonn since January 2017. I respectfully request a DM 2 337 loan, repayable over 36 months, to purchase a high-definition television and Internet radio set that will serve as essential tools for my online certification courses in advanced network security.  

I earn a net salary of DM 4 100 per month. My checking account balance normally sits between DM 100 and DM 180; it has never been in the red. I own a terraced house in Bad Godesberg valued at approximately DM 250 000, free of encumbrances. The sole outstanding debt I carry is a DM 8 300 renovation loan with Postbank, which I have serviced punctually for 18 months. I am single and support one dependent, my seven-year-old son.  

The requested installment equates to less than 3 % of my monthly income, leaving ample margin for unforeseen expenses. My seven-plus years of steady employment with a major German company, combined with real-estate ownership and an unblemished repayment history, attest to my reliability.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Peter Novak, a 36-year-old Czech national working as a senior clerical official at the Munich City Housing Authority since March 2014. I wish to obtain a DM 2 337 loan for 36 months to replace my obsolete CRT television and short-wave radio with modern digital units. The upgrade is important for following municipal emergency broadcasts and supporting my daughter’s distance-learning assignments.  

My net monthly income stands at DM 3 750. My checking account balance, currently DM 85, has never been overdrawn. I own a small row house in Pasing valued at roughly DM 210 000, fully paid. Aside from a DM 4 900 furniture loan at Volksbank (12 payments remaining, all on time), I have no other obligations.  

Living at the same address for four years and maintaining ten years of continuous civil-service employment speak to my stability. The loan’s 4 % installment, about DM 97 monthly, is comfortably within my disposable income. I am confident you will find my application low-risk and in line with your lending criteria.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Peter Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Luka Ilic, a 36-year-old Croatian air-traffic-control technician employed at Fraport AG for the past twelve years. I am applying for a DM 2 337 loan over 36 months to purchase an advanced home-theater system—television, receiver, and digital radio—to improve my German-language skills through educational programming during off-duty hours.  

My net take-home pay averages DM 4 600 monthly. My current account maintains a balance of about DM 130; I have never utilized an overdraft facility. I own a condominium in Sachsenhausen valued at approximately DM 240 000 with no mortgage outstanding. The only other credit I hold is a DM 7 100 car loan at Deutsche Kreditbank, of which 30 % has already been repaid without incident. I have one dependent, my eight-year-old niece, who lives with me.  

The proposed installment rate represents less than 2.5 % of my monthly income, ensuring timely repayment. Twelve years of uninterrupted employment in a safety-critical field, coupled with property ownership and an impeccable payment record, demonstrate my reliability.  

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my application further and provide any supporting documents you may require.  

Yours faithfully,  
Luka Ilic
