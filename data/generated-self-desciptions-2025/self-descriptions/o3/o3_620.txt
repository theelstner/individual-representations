Hanover, 21 May 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ana Petrova, a 21-year-old Bulgarian national living in Hanover for four years. I have been employed for three years as a scientific research assistant at Hannover Medical School, earning a net salary of 2,050 DM per month. I am applying for a 3,441 DM loan over 30 months to furnish the two-room flat that my six-year-old son and I rent.  

My present checking balance is 172 DM and I keep 289 DM in a savings book for emergencies. I already hold a small study loan with your bank; every installment has been paid punctually and the balance will be cleared in six months. Other than that, I carry no additional debts.  

Reliability is central to my work and personal life. My employment contract is open-ended, my income comfortably covers the proposed monthly installment of roughly 140 DM, and my sister, Dr. Elena Petrova, has agreed to co-sign the application. I also own a 2019 Opel Corsa, providing further collateral.  

I would be grateful for your support so I can create a stable, well-furnished home for my child. Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Ana Petrova

Munich, 30 April 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am María Gómez, a 21-year-old Spanish mechanical draftswoman employed at Siemens Energy in Munich since June 2022. My net monthly income is 2,170 DM. Together with my husband, Luis Gómez (co-applicant), I seek a 3,441 DM loan for essential kitchen and nursery equipment for the apartment we have rented since 2021.  

Our current account shows 95 DM and we maintain a savings balance of 310 DM. We have one existing consumer credit with your bank; all 24 past installments were transferred on time. We have no other installment plans or credit cards.  

Our combined income of 3,900 DM easily supports the requested repayment schedule. We own a 2020 Seat Ibiza, hold permanent work permits, and intend to remain in Germany long-term. Luis’s involvement as co-signer further secures the loan.  

We value the relationship with your bank and pledge to honor every due date, as our history already demonstrates. Thank you for your trust.  

Kind regards,  
María Gómez

Stuttgart, 14 May 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ivana Novak, a Croatian national, divorced, residing in Stuttgart for four years. I have worked as a certified dental nurse at Praxis Dr. Keller for exactly 30 months, earning 1,980 DM net. I request a loan of 3,441 DM over 30 months to purchase ergonomic equipment for my home office and new bedroom furniture for my daughter.  

I currently keep 143 DM in my checking account and 275 DM in a savings plan. The only credit I hold—also with your bank—began in 2023 and has never been in arrears. No other obligations exist.  

My monthly budget allows an installment of up to 150 DM while still leaving ample room for rent and childcare. My brother, Marko Novak, employed by Bosch, will act as guarantor. Additionally, I own a 2018 Ford Fiesta valued at approximately 4,000 DM.  

I have shown reliability both professionally and financially and would welcome the chance to continue that record with this new loan. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Ivana Novak

Hamburg, 3 May 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Sophie Nguyen, a 21-year-old Vietnamese citizen, separated, and mother to a five-year-old girl. Since March 2022 I have been a logistics clerk at Hapag-Lloyd in Hamburg, taking home 2,120 DM monthly. I seek a loan of 3,441 DM to replace worn living-room furniture and buy a laptop that will allow me to pursue evening coursework.  

My checking balance is 187 DM; I also hold 302 DM in a postal savings account. I have a single active credit with your bank (balance 640 DM), serviced flawlessly for the past 18 months. I rent a flat where I have lived since 2021 and own a 2017 Renault Clio.  

The proposed repayment of roughly 140 DM fits comfortably within my budget, and my cousin, Linh Tran, a software engineer, has agreed to co-sign. My consistent employment record, punctual repayments, and modest savings underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to continuing my positive relationship with your institution.  

Sincerely,  
Sophie Nguyen

Esteemed Loan Committee,  

My name is Teresa Silva, Portuguese, age 21, married, and the mother of a toddler. I have been an accounts-payable officer at Deutsche Logistik AG for 34 months, earning a stable net income of 2,260 DM. I request a 3,441 DM loan for new bedroom and office furniture as my family prepares for a second child.

I value integrity and punctuality, qualities reflected in my job performance and credit history. I am confident that I will honor every installment and strengthen our long-standing relationship.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Warm regards,
