Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Kowalska, a 22-year-old Polish laboratory technician employed at Biocell GmbH since 7 February 2025. I respectfully request a loan of 1 366 DM to purchase a second-hand radio/television set for my rented apartment in Schwabing, where I live with my three-year-old son.  

Although my current current-account balance shows –74 DM, all transactions since the account was opened nine months ago have been covered within the same month. I still hold a building-society savings contract (Bausparvertrag) with a paid-in value of 870 DM and life-insurance coverage of 25 000 DM. My previous furniture loan of 600 DM at your branch was settled two months ahead of schedule, demonstrating my reliability.  

My net salary is 2 100 DM. I propose an installment of 46 DM per month (3 % of income), which comfortably fits my household budget after rent (640 DM) and daycare (320 DM). I have no other debts, no guarantor, and have resided at my current address for four years.  

Granting this small loan will improve my family’s quality of life and continue to build my positive credit record with your bank. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Kowalska

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Maria Rodrigues, a Portuguese nursing assistant working at St.-Marien Hospital since 3 December 2024. I am applying for a 1 366 DM loan to buy a combined radio/television unit so my six-year-old daughter and I can follow German language programmes at home.  

My checking account, opened nine months ago, is currently overdrawn by 55 DM, but no payment has ever been returned. The wardrobe loan I took last year with your bank (1 200 DM) was repaid exactly on schedule. Apart from that, I have no other credit obligations.  

My net monthly wage is 1 950 DM. An installment of 45 DM (3 %) is manageable alongside rent (560 DM) and childcare (250 DM). I pay 30 DM each month into a life-insurance policy worth 20 000 DM. I have lived at my present rented flat in Altona for four years and can provide confirmation from my landlord of punctual payments.  

I believe my steady employment in the healthcare sector, disciplined repayment history, and modest financial request make me a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to a positive reply.  

Respectfully,  
Maria Rodrigues

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Oksana Petrova, a Ukrainian graphic-design assistant employed by Medienwerk AG since 1 January 2025. I seek a loan of 1 366 DM to purchase a small television and digital radio set needed for my remote-design assignments and for personal use.  

My current account, active for nine months, shows a negative balance of 89 DM due to recent software expenses, yet no payment has failed. I previously financed a laptop through your bank (1 400 DM, 2023) and repaid it without delay.  

Income: 2 300 DM net per month. Proposed repayment: 48 DM monthly over 30 months—just under 3 % of my income. I rent an apartment in Flingern where I have resided since 2021 and support my younger sister, aged eight. I hold a BHW savings contract with 1 050 DM saved and a 25 000 DM life-insurance policy naming her as beneficiary.  

My flawless repayment record, stable employment, and clear budgeting demonstrate my reliability. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Oksana Petrova

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Sofía García, a 22-year-old Spanish administrative clerk working for the Baden-Württemberg State Tax Office since 15 November 2024 (Beamtenanwärterin). I need a 1 366 DM loan to acquire a television/radio combo—essential for staying informed during my public-service training.  

Though my Girokonto stands at –63 DM, it has never exceeded the authorised overdraft since opening nine months ago. I successfully repaid a 900 DM relocation loan at your bank in June, establishing a dependable history.  

My net civil-service trainee income is 2 050 DM. Paying back 45 DM monthly (3 %) is entirely feasible alongside rent (530 DM). I have a three-year-old daughter and no other financial commitments. My building-society contract holds 940 DM, and my life-insurance policy totals 30 000 DM. I have rented the same flat in Vaihingen for four years and always pay on time.  

I trust that my secure government employment and previous punctual repayments qualify me for this modest credit. Thank you for your time.  

Respectfully,  
Sofía García

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Li Mei, a Chinese mechanical-drafting apprentice at RuhrTech Maschinenbau GmbH since 5 March 2025. I request a loan of 1 366 DM to buy a combined radio and television set, which will serve both study purposes and family leisure.  

I have held my checking account for nine months; it currently shows –70 DM, yet every debit has been covered within the same billing cycle. I completed repayment of a 1 100 DM language-course loan with your bank last month, on schedule and without arrears.  

My net training allowance is 1 650 DM. A 44 DM installment (3 %) leaves ample room after rent (480 DM) and child support for my four-year-old son (200 DM). I possess a life-insurance policy valued at 22 000 DM and a Bausparvertrag with 760 DM saved. I have lived at my rented residence in Rüttenscheid for four years and maintain excellent relations with my landlord.  

I take pride in fulfilling my obligations and am committed to strengthening my credit standing in Germany. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Sincerely,  
Li Mei
