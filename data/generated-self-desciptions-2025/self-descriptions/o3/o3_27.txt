Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Thomas Bergmann, 36, and I am requesting a loan of 1,374 DM to purchase basic furniture and a second-hand laptop for my new apartment. Two years and four months ago I began full-time work as a night-shift warehouse operative at RheinCargo AG in Mainz, earning a net 2,050 DM per month. I own a small condominium in which I reside with my eight-year-old son Leon; the flat was inherited from my late parents and is free of liens.

Although my current checking balance is –132 DM, this is temporary and related to school fees I paid upfront last month. I hold 61 DM in a savings passbook and have never missed a payment on the 2019 micro-credit I settled with your bank last spring. All other obligations are up to date, and I have no guarantors or additional debt. With the requested amount, my monthly installment would stay below 5 % of my income, which I can comfortably cover.

My steady employment, perfect repayment record, and owned residence make me a reliable borrower. I am reachable anytime at 06131-77-221. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Thomas Bergmann

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Markus Klein, single, 36, working as a hospital orderly at St. Vinzenz Klinik in Düsseldorf since March 2023. My net salary averages 1,980 DM. I respectfully apply for a 1,374 DM loan to buy a washing machine, wardrobes, and ergonomic tools that ease my back problems after long shifts.

My checking account currently shows –87 DM; however, I have never overdrawn beyond the agreed limit and always bring it back to positive before month-end. I keep 45 DM in a savings booklet as an emergency buffer. In 2021 I finished repaying a 2,000 DM study loan with your bank—every installment was punctual.

I own a modest terraced house in Ratingen, mortgage-free after inheritance, and live there with my ten-year-old niece, for whom I am legal guardian. With no other debts, the projected repayment of roughly 58 DM per month represents less than 3 % of my income.

My proven payment discipline, secure employment, and owned property demonstrate my creditworthiness. I appreciate your positive review and remain available at 02102-44-981.

Kind regards,  
Markus Klein

To the Credit Committee,

My name is Daniel Schuster, age 36, resident of Ulm. For the past three years I have been a bus depot attendant with SüdWest Verkehr GmbH, earning a steady 1,890 DM net monthly. I seek a 1,374 DM loan to purchase bunk beds, a study desk, and workbench shelving after recent renovations to my flat.

I presently show a small overdraft of –64 DM; my savings passbook holds 52 DM. Apart from one 1,500 DM consumer loan from your bank that I repaid in April 2024 without a single delay, I carry no other credit. I own outright a 55 m² apartment near the depot, inherited in 2020, where I live with my son Felix (age 7).

My monthly budget leaves over 1,200 DM after essentials, so the planned installment of 60 DM fits comfortably. I have maintained continuous employment, pay all utilities on time, and can be reached anytime on my registered telephone 0731-66-556.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing a trustworthy relationship with the bank.

Respectfully,  
Daniel Schuster

Dear Credit Department,

I am Peter Novak, 36, single father to my six-year-old daughter Mia. Since June 2022 I have worked as a municipal groundskeeper for the city of Regensburg, earning 1,960 DM net. I request a loan of 1,374 DM to furnish Mia’s new bedroom and to buy electric garden tools that will allow me to take occasional weekend landscaping jobs for extra income.

My checking balance is currently –119 DM, within the agreed overdraft limit. I keep 38 DM in a small savings account. In 2020 I took a 1,200 DM loan from this bank for appliance repairs and settled it three months early. I hold no other debt, and there are no guarantors involved.

I reside in a mortgage-free cottage on land I inherited from my grandfather; municipal records confirm clear title. With a planned repayment of 55–60 DM monthly, the installment remains well below 4 % of my salary.

Given my public-sector employment, spotless repayment history, and owned property, I trust you will view my application favorably. You may contact me at 0941-88-114 for any further details.

Sincerely,  
Peter Novak

Esteemed Loan Manager,

My name is Andreas Vogel, a 36-year-old kitchen assistant at Hotel Adler in Freiburg, where I have been employed full time since August 2022 and earn 1,870 DM net each month. I seek a loan of 1,374 DM to replace worn-out living-room furniture and purchase a secondhand refrigerator.

Though my checking account presently shows –75 DM, I have never exceeded the authorized overdraft. My savings booklet holds 57 DM. In 2022 I completed repayment of a 1,600 DM renovation loan with your bank—thirteen installments paid precisely on schedule. Apart from that, I carry no debts.

I own a 48 m² studio flat near the hotel, bequeathed by my parents and unencumbered by any mortgage. My ten-year-old brother Jonas lives with me as my dependent. The proposed monthly payment of about 58 DM represents less than 3.5 % of my net income, which my budget easily accommodates.

I believe my consistent work record, previous flawless repayment, and property ownership make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for your time and consideration. I can be reached at 0761-55-440.

Warm regards,  
Andreas Vogel
