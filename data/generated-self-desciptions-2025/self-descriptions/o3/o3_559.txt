Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Schneider. I am 29 years old, divorced, and live in my own flat in Darmstadt with my six-year-old daughter. For the last two years and two months I have been employed full-time as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits, earning a net salary of 3,450 EUR per month.  

I am applying for a loan of 5,003 EUR to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e. My current twenty-year-old car broke down permanently last month, and reliable transport is essential for my daily 42-km commute and for taking my daughter to kindergarten. I have calculated that the proposed monthly instalment of 140 EUR comfortably fits within my disposable income.  

During the past four years I have taken two small consumer loans from your bank (a furniture loan in 2020 and a laptop loan in 2022). Both were repaid ahead of schedule and without a single late payment. I have no other outstanding debt, maintain life-insurance savings of 8,500 EUR, and have been registered in Germany since 2019. Your positive experience with me as a customer, combined with my stable employment, makes me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide any additional documentation you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Schneider

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Anita Rossi, 29, married, and the owner of a condominium in Augsburg where I have lived for four years. Since May 2020 I have been working as a senior dental hygienist at Dr. Haller & Partner Dental Clinic, earning 3,050 EUR net per month on a permanent contract.  

I seek a loan of 5,003 EUR to finance a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid. My husband and I share one vehicle, and conflicting work schedules have led to frequent transportation problems. A second, fuel-efficient car will allow me to reach patients in nearby retirement homes, a service the clinic added to my duties this year. The planned repayment rate of 135 EUR per month represents just 4 % of our household net income, leaving ample safety margin.  

Your bank has already supported me with two small instalment credits (washing machine 2019, study course 2021). Both were settled exactly as agreed. I hold a building-society savings contract with a current balance of 6,200 EUR and have no other loans or guarantor obligations. My spotless repayment record and stable professional outlook underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Anita Rossi

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Elena Petrova, a 29-year-old Bulgarian national residing in my own terraced house in Nürnberg since 2019. I have been employed for 18 months as a project coordinator at Siemens Energy, earning 3,300 EUR net monthly plus an annual bonus.  

I request a loan of 5,003 EUR to buy a new Škoda Fabia. My family recently moved to a suburban district not served by public transport, making a dependable vehicle indispensable for reaching the office and for my five-year-old son’s daycare. The envisaged instalment of 145 EUR will be automatically debited from my salary account each month, comfortably below my budgeted limit.  

I have twice demonstrated punctual repayment with you: a 1,200 EUR relocation loan (cleared in 2021) and a 900 EUR appliance loan (cleared in 2022). I carry no other debt, maintain a life-insurance policy with 10,000 EUR surrender value, and have never missed a payment. These facts, together with my permanent contract, assure you of my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further questions.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am Gabriela Costa, aged 29, separated, and resident in my own townhouse in Bremen for four years. Since March 2021 I have been employed as office manager at NordSeefracht GmbH, earning 2,950 EUR net per month under an unlimited contract.  

I am applying for a 5,003 EUR loan to acquire a new Renault Clio E-Tech. My current diesel car exceeds 300,000 km and fails to meet upcoming emission restrictions in Bremen city centre. The planned green vehicle will secure my commute and reduce running costs. A monthly instalment of 130 EUR fits well within my financial plan, leaving more than 1,100 EUR free each month after fixed expenses.  

Your bank previously financed both my heat-pump installation (repaid 2022) and a language-course loan (repaid 2023). I honoured every instalment on time. I hold a building-society savings agreement worth 7,400 EUR and have no other liabilities. My consistent repayment history and stable income make me a low-risk borrower.  

Thank you for evaluating my request. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Gabriela Costa

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Sophie Laurent, 29, married, and living in my own apartment in Cologne since 2019. For the past 14 months I have worked as a certified management accountant at CloudHive Software AG, earning 3,600 EUR net monthly plus performance bonuses.  

I wish to obtain a loan of 5,003 EUR to purchase a new Mazda2 for commuting. My husband and I currently share one vehicle, and my recent switch to a client-facing role requires daily travel to customer sites. The proposed repayment of 150 EUR per month is well within my discretionary income, which averages 1,300 EUR after fixed costs.  

Your institution has already extended me two consumer loans totalling 2,700 EUR during my studies; both were repaid in full and ahead of schedule. I have no other credit commitments, possess a life-insurance policy with a present value of 9,800 EUR, and maintain an impeccable payment record. These factors, combined with a secure professional career, testify to my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am happy to provide any additional information.  

Kind regards,  
Sophie Laurent
