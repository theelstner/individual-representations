Stuttgart, 14 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Mehmet Arslan, a 41-year-old research technician at Daimler Truck AG, where I have been employed for five years and three months. I earn a net salary of 4,150 DM per month, which comfortably covers my living expenses, child support for my two daughters (ages 9 and 11), and the installments on the two earlier loans I repaid with your bank without a single delay.  

I am applying for a 3,979 DM loan over 48 months to purchase a new OLED television and digital audio receiver. My current set is beyond repair, and because the girls spend every second weekend with me, having a functional TV is essential for both their schooling needs and our family time.  

My checking account balance typically stays around 120 DM after monthly transfers to my mortgage and household costs. I have no other installment plans, and my only property is a fully insured 2019 Volkswagen Golf. Living in my own condominium keeps my housing expenses predictable.  

Given my stable employment, clean repayment record, and long-standing relationship with your bank, I trust you will view my application favorably. I am available by phone at any time for further information.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Arslan

Munich, 12 June 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Luca Rinaldi, a single 41-year-old Italian citizen working as a senior customs officer at Munich Airport. I have held this official post for six years and currently earn 4,300 DM net per month plus an annual bonus equal to one month’s pay.  

I request a 3,979 DM consumer loan for 48 months to replace my outdated television and add a DAB+ radio system to my apartment. The equipment is required for language-training videos that help my two dependent nephews, whom I support remotely, and for staying informed during night shifts.  

My account with your branch shows an average balance of 80–150 DM. I repaid two earlier loans (one for home renovations in 2019 and one car loan in 2021) on schedule and in full. I own my studio apartment and a 2020 Ford Focus, both fully insured. I carry no additional debts and have never missed a payment.  

With secure civil-service employment, a demonstrable history of punctual repayments, and transparent finances, I am confident that granting this modest loan entails minimal risk for the bank. I can be reached at the listed number for any questions.  

Kind regards,  
Luca Rinaldi

Dresden, 10 June 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Peter Kowalski, age forty-one, employed as a certified electronics service technician at Siemens Energy since February 2021, following two and a half years with a subcontractor on the same site. My current net income is 3,950 DM per month plus overtime.  

I seek a 3,979 DM loan for forty-eight months to buy a 65-inch smart TV and surround-sound receiver. This will allow me to cancel an expensive cinema subscription and provide educational programming for my twin sons, who stay with me every second week.  

My current account balance usually ranges between 60 and 180 DM just before payday, reflecting disciplined budgeting. I have no savings account yet, but I own a 2018 Opel Astra outright and live in a mortgage-free townhouse inherited from my late parents. I previously took two small installment loans with your bank (laptop purchase in 2020, bathroom renovation in 2022) and repaid both ahead of schedule.  

My stable employment, asset position, and impeccable repayment record make me a low-risk applicant. I appreciate your consideration and am happy to supply any additional documentation.  

Respectfully,  
Peter Kowalski

Frankfurt am Main, 13 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Rajesh Kumar, 41, employed for six years as a network administrator at Deutsche Telekom IT GmbH, earning 4,200 DM net monthly. I request a loan of 3,979 DM, repayable over 48 months, to purchase a 4K television and Internet radio receiver. Aside from personal use, this equipment will enable me to follow remote-learning courses that help my sons (ages 8 and 10) with computer-science assignments.  

My checking account rarely holds more than 150 DM because I prioritize direct transfers to household expenses and a private pension. I own a 2019 Skoda Octavia and a condominium bought in 2017; both are fully insured and debt-free.  

I have held two previous loans with your institution: a 2019 kitchen renovation loan and a 2021 car repair loan, both repaid without delay. I carry no other obligations, and my credit report is clear.  

Given my secure position in a major telecom company, consistent income, and spotless repayment history, I trust you will view this application positively. I can be reached by telephone at any time for clarification.  

Thank you for your attention.  

Sincerely,  
Rajesh Kumar

Leipzig, 15 June 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Carlos Fernandez, a Spanish citizen residing in Germany for 14 years. I am 41 and have worked as a mechanical foreman at BMW’s Leipzig plant for four years and eight months, earning a net salary of 4,000 DM plus shift premiums.  

I wish to obtain a 3,979 DM loan over 48 months to buy a new television set and an integrated FM/DAB radio. The current device failed beyond repair, and with custody of my two teenage dependents every weekend, I consider a reliable media center essential.  

My daily checking balance ranges from 90–170 DM because I maintain strict control of expenses. I hold no savings account but possess clear-title ownership of a 2017 Audi A4 and my own row house, for which the mortgage was fully repaid last year.  

I have previously financed two items with your bank—a water-damage repair in 2020 and a dental procedure in 2022—both settled precisely on schedule. I have no other liabilities, and my employment contract is permanent.  

My stable income, history of punctual repayments, and tangible assets demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss any aspect of my application.  

With best regards,  
Carlos Fernandez
