Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Hoffmann, 27, married, with a four-year-old daughter. I have kept my checking account at your branch since July 2022 with an average balance above 800 DM; my monthly salary has been deposited there without interruption. I also hold a savings passbook with 1 450 DM.  

I am requesting a 709 DM loan to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Spring that will allow me to accept night-shift warehouse work twenty kilometres outside the city. Since March 2025 I have been employed on a one-year contract by HanseLogistik GmbH, earning 1 900 DM net. Before that I was between jobs but never over-drawn.  

In 2023 I took a 600 DM furniture loan from you and repaid every instalment on time. I own the terraced house in which my family and I live (inherited, no mortgage) and have no other debts or guarantees outstanding. The requested loan will be repaid over six months at the proposed two-rate instalment plan, which fits comfortably within my monthly budget.  

My clean repayment record, stable account history, and real-estate collateral demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Hoffmann

Bremen, 13 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Stefan Berger, 27, married and father of one, apply for a 709 DM car loan. I opened my current account with you in May 2022, always keeping the balance above 500 DM. My Sparkasse bond account stands at 1 200 DM.  

Since February 2025 I have been working as a dock labourer at Nordport AG on a probationary contract (net income 1 850 DM). Regular public transport ends before my 5 a.m. shift; therefore I need a small new Opel Corsa to reach the harbour.  

I previously financed a 450 DM consumer credit with your bank in 2024 and settled it three months early. I own a mortgage-free apartment in Bremen-Gröpelingen, purchased jointly with my wife through inheritance, and we have no other instalment obligations.  

With only one dependent and modest household expenses, the agreed two-rate monthly repayment fits neatly within my budget. I am committed to maintaining my impeccable payment behaviour and long-standing relationship with your bank.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Stefan Berger

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Michael Krüger, widower, 27, raising my six-year-old son alone. I respectfully request a 709 DM loan to cover the final portion of a new Skoda Fabia, required for commuting.  

I have been a seasonal machine operator at Ostsee-Werft GmbH since January 2025, earning 2 000 DM net. Though my employment is recent, my checking account with you has received regular benefit and wage payments since August 2022, never falling below 300 DM. My savings account holds 1 380 DM.  

In 2023 I obtained a 550 DM appliance credit from your bank and paid every instalment punctually. I live in and own a small detached house in Suchsdorf (title enclosed). I carry no other loans, credit cards, or guarantees.  

The proposed two-rate six-month repayment schedule equals less than 8 % of my net income, ensuring comfortable servicing of the debt. My past repayment record, property ownership, and secure savings demonstrate low risk.  

I look forward to continuing our reliable cooperation.  

Kind regards,  
Michael Krüger

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Andreas Neumann, 27, married with one infant. I seek a 709 DM credit to complete payment on a new Renault Twingo Electric that will let me travel to construction sites outside Rostock.  

Although classed as an unskilled worker, I began a twelve-month trainee contract as scaffolding assistant at HanseBau GmbH in April 2025 (net pay 1 780 DM). My current account has been active with you since June 2022, average balance 600 DM. I own bonds worth 1 050 DM.  

Your bank granted me a 500 DM study loan in 2023; all instalments were cleared as scheduled by February 2025. I possess a debt-free row house in Evershagen, inherited from my late father. My family carries no additional credit lines.  

The suggested two-rate plan will be debited automatically, keeping my payment behaviour transparent and reliable. I believe my proven history and tangible collateral qualify me as a trustworthy applicant.  

Thank you for evaluating my request.  

Sincerely,  
Andreas Neumann

Esteemed Credit Board,  

I, Thomas Weiss, 27, widowed, with one dependent, respectfully apply for a 709 DM loan. The funds will finalize the purchase of a new Volkswagen Up! that replaces my twelve-year-old vehicle, now beyond repair, and allows me to continue my courier work.  

Since December 2024 I have been on a six-month renewable contract with Baltic Express Couriers, earning 1 950 DM net. My Giro account, opened with you in April 2022, maintains a standing balance above 550 DM, and my savings account shows 1 300 DM.  

I have a spotless repayment history, having settled a 480 DM travel loan from your bank in 2024 without delay. I own, free of debt, a small townhouse in Lübeck-St. Gertrud, providing solid collateral. No other credits or guarantees exist in my name.  

The proposed two-rate instalment represents less than one-tenth of my monthly income, well within my budget. My stable account conduct, prior punctual repayments, and real-estate assets collectively attest to my reliability.  

I appreciate your favourable consideration.  

Faithfully,  
Thomas Weiss
