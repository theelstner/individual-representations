Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a consumer loan of 1,829 € for the purchase of a new smart television and DAB+ radio set that I will use in my home‐office training courses. I have been a senior electrician with Siemens Energy in Karlsruhe for the past 18 years, earning a fixed net salary of 3,100 € per month. I have lived in my own house for four years and I own a 2018 Volkswagen Golf with a clear title.

Although I currently hold two small instalment loans with your bank and one earlier loan with another institution (repaid late once during the pandemic), all obligations are now up to date and serviced by automatic debit. I have no other debts, no overdraft facilities and no outstanding taxes. My only dependent is my 14-year-old daughter, whose child support is automatically deducted from my salary. With a monthly surplus of roughly 1,200 € after living expenses, I can easily meet the projected instalment of about 125 €.

I do not yet keep a checking account with your bank, but I would be willing to transfer my salary here if the loan is approved. As a long-term employee with a stable trade, verified income and collateral in the form of my vehicle, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,  
Franklin J. Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I hereby request a loan of 1,829 € over 15 months to buy a combined TV-radio studio monitor set. As a German customs officer stationed at Frankfurt Airport since May 2016, I earn a secure net income of 3,350 € per month plus holiday bonuses. My employment is civil service and therefore permanent.

My present liabilities consist of a 4,700 € education loan at Deutsche Kreditbank and two fully performing instalment loans with your branch. I have never defaulted; the DKB loan was briefly flagged “critical” in 2021 due to a late employer payment, but the arrears were settled within that same month. I keep less than 100 € in a savings book because I send most free funds to my elderly mother in Vietnam—my sole dependent.

Housing is my own condo, mortgage-free since last year. I own a 2020 Toyota Corolla. After fixed costs I retain 1,050 € every month, comfortably covering the estimated 125 € instalment.

I maintain a spotless service record and I am ready to shift my salary to a new checking account at your bank. I would appreciate the opportunity to expand our relationship.

Kind regards,  
David Thanh Nguyen

Dear Lending Department,

I wish to borrow 1,829 € to replace my outdated CRT television and kitchen radio with modern energy-saving devices. For eight years I have worked as an IT support specialist at the University of Ulm, permanent contract, earning 2,980 € net monthly. My residence, which I built in 2021 on family land, has been my home for four years; ownership is unencumbered.

I currently service two small personal loans with your bank and a 1,500 € camera loan at another institution that was once marked “critical” after a missed payment in 2022. Since then, all dues have been paid punctually by automated transfer. I have no other instalment plans, credit card balance or guarantor commitments. My dependent is my 11-year-old son, for whom I receive child benefit.

Monthly disposable income averages 900 € after expenses, far exceeding the projected 125 € repayment. I drive a 2019 Opel Astra and hold full comprehensive insurance, which I offer as supplementary security.

I hope my long, stable employment and transparent repayment history will merit your approval.

Respectfully,  
Marco A. Rossi

Dear Ms. Krüger,

Please accept my application for a 1,829 € loan for the purpose of purchasing a new 55-inch TV and digital radio receiver that will enable me to continue freelance product-testing work in the evenings. I have served as a mechanical laboratory technician at BASF’s Magdeburg facility for ten years, earning 3,040 € net per month.

I hold two active loans with your bank—both paid on time—and a single credit card balance of 600 € at Sparkasse that was once overdue in 2020 but has since been fully regularised. I possess a 2017 Ford Focus and own my detached house, where I have resided for four years. My dependent is my 20-year-old apprentice nephew who lives with me.

My budget allows a surplus of around 1,150 € monthly, more than sufficient to cover the required instalment. I keep a small savings account (currently 82 €) for emergencies.

I can provide payroll statements, employment confirmation and vehicle documents upon request, and I am willing to open a current account with your institution. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,  
Peter Schubert

Dear Credit Committee,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,829 € over 15 months to purchase a new 4K television and DAB radio set for my home, which doubles as a demonstration site for the distance-learning physics courses I teach. I have been employed for seven and a half years as a scientific research assistant at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Cologne, with a stable net income of 3,200 € per month.

My credit experience includes two small consumer loans with your bank—both serviced flawlessly—and an equipment lease with another institution that was briefly delinquent in 2021 due to administrative error. This status has been fully corrected and the lease will be paid off by December. I own my residence outright and a 2018 Skoda Octavia. My only dependent is my teenage son.

Fixed obligations leave me with an average free cash flow of 1,000 € each month, well above the required instalment. I have no other instalment plans, guarantor obligations or tax arrears. Though I currently manage my day-to-day finances through a prepaid card, I intend to open a full current account at your branch if the loan is granted.

I am confident that my long-term employment, solid income and transparent repayment record make me a reliable candidate. I appreciate your time and look forward to your favourable response.

Best regards,
