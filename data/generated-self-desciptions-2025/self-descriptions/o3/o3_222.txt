Letter 1  
Stuttgart, 14 June 1994  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Carlos Mendes, a 26-year-old Portuguese citizen living and working in Stuttgart. For the past nine months I have been employed as a warehouse assistant at DHL Logistics GmbH, earning a net monthly salary of 1 850 DM. My wife and I recently bought a small one-bedroom flat at Schwieberdinger Straße 27; the deed is registered in our names and the mortgage is fully paid off thanks to an inheritance from my late grandfather.

I am requesting a loan of 625 DM for twelve months to purchase a modern Grundig television set and aerial. Our three-year-old daughter Ana is learning German primarily through children’s programmes, and reliable access to TV will greatly support her language skills.

Financially, I maintain a checking balance that averages 150 DM and a savings balance of 60 DM. Last year I took a 900 DM loan from your bank for a washing machine and repaid it two months ahead of schedule. My father-in-law, Herr Klaus Hartmann (civil engineer, 3 200 DM net), has agreed in writing to act as guarantor again.

With a proven repayment record, steady employment, and real-estate collateral, I am confident I meet your trust requirements. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendes

Hamburg, 3 May 1994  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Petar Ivanov, age 26, married, and originally from Sofia. Since July of last year I have worked as a line cook at Restaurant Baltic in Hamburg-Altona, earning 1 700 DM net per month plus tips. My wife Maria and I own a small terraced house at Billhorner Röhrendamm 91, purchased outright with family savings.

We wish to borrow 625 DM over twelve months to buy a combined radio-television unit so Maria can attend remote language courses broadcast on NDR. The set will also help our five-month-old son become familiar with German speech early on.

Our household finances are modest but stable: 120 DM currently in our checking account and 75 DM in a savings passbook. I have one existing 1 200 DM appliance loan with your bank; all instalments have been paid punctually. My brother-in-law, Dr. Jens Krüger (general practitioner, 4 600 DM net), has completed the guarantor forms.

Given my spotless credit record, secure housing, and strong family backing, I believe I am a dependable candidate. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,  
Petar Ivanov

Berlin, 27 April 1994  

Esteemed Credit Department,

My name is Ahmed El-Sayed, a 26-year-old Egyptian widower residing in Berlin-Neukölln with my six-year-old son Youssef. I have been employed for eight months as a night-shift bus cleaner at Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG), earning 1 600 DM monthly.

I request a 625 DM loan, repayable in twelve equal instalments, to purchase a Panasonic radio-television set. German educational broadcasts will support my son’s upcoming primary-school enrolment, and the built-in shortwave band lets us follow news from Cairo.

My checking account balance is presently 95 DM and I keep 40 DM in a Sparbuch for emergencies. Two years ago I borrowed 700 DM from your branch for winter heating repairs and settled the debt exactly on schedule. My cousin, Mahmoud Farouk (mechanical engineer, 3 300 DM net, resident of Charlottenburg), stands ready as guarantor.

Owning the title to a small studio apartment at Sonnenallee 223 and having demonstrated punctual repayment, I trust you will view my application favourably. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed El-Sayed  



Letter 4  
Frankfurt a.M., 9 June 1994  

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Marek Nowak, 26 years old, Polish national, married with one child. Since August 1993 I have worked as a night-watch security guard for Wacht GmbH at Frankfurt Airport, bringing home 1 750 DM per month.

I am applying for a 625 DM twelve-month loan to replace our malfunctioning television. My wife uses televised VHS language lessons, and our four-year-old son Piotr relies on children’s programming while I work night shifts.

Our current-account balance is 135 DM; savings: 70 DM. I hold real-estate title to a 36 m² condominium in Niederrad, purchased last year with family assistance. In 1992 your bank granted me a 1 000 DM loan for carpentry tools; I repaid it three weeks early. My mother-in-law, Frau Ingrid Becker (retired teacher, pension 2 300 DM), has signed on as guarantor.

A solid employment record, owned property, and proven reliability underscore my creditworthiness. I appreciate your consideration and am available for any additional information.

Sincerely,  
Marek Nowak  



Letter 5  
Munich, 18 May 1994  

To the Credit Committee,

I am Ricardo Gómez, 26, a Spanish citizen residing in Munich-Sendling with my wife and newborn daughter. For the past seven months I have been a porter at Hotel Europa, earning approximately 1 680 DM net including service bonuses.

I seek a 625 DM loan over twelve months to buy a combined colour television and FM radio unit. Apart from family entertainment, the set will facilitate my correspondence German course broadcast on BR-alpha, helping me qualify for a better-paid front-desk position.

My finances are carefully managed: 140 DM in my giro account and 55 DM in a savings bond. I presently service one installment plan with your bank for 950 DM (refrigerator) and have never missed a payment. I also own, mortgage-free, a small cottage in my hometown of Zamora, Spain, valued at roughly 20 000 DM. My father, Señor Juan Gómez (postal supervisor, 3 100 DM net), has agreed to guarantee the loan.

With demonstrated repayment discipline, stable employment, and property assets, I am confident of my suitability. Thank you for considering my request.

Warm regards,  
Ricardo Gómez
