Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Daniel Schneider, 28, employed as a mechanical laboratory technician at Siemens Energy in Erlangen since March 2022 (now 2 years and 2 months). I am applying for a 3 343 DM loan to purchase basic furniture and electrical appliances for the first apartment I will move into this summer.   
Financially, I earn 4 650 DM gross per month and live rent-free with my parents, so my disposable income comfortably covers the proposed instalment of 240 DM (≈ 4 % of my net pay). I have a 5-year-old son whom I support, plus a small auto loan (from ABC Finance) that I have never missed a payment on. With your bank I currently hold a 1 200 DM consumer credit, and all instalments have been paid punctually for eleven consecutive months.  
Although I have not yet opened a current account, I am ready to do so together with this loan. I can be reached any time on my registered home telephone and will gladly provide employer references. My stable employment, spotless repayment record and moderate debt level make me a reliable customer.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Schneider  



Dear Credit Department,

I am Marco Rossi, 28-year-old single air-traffic operations assistant at Munich Airport, a post I have held since November 2020 (3 years 6 months). I request a loan of 3 343 DM to buy an ergonomic desk, filing cabinets and specialised software so I can finish my part-time aeronautical management diploma.  
My gross salary is 5 100 DM per month, and I live in employer-provided housing at no cost. The only other liability I carry is a student loan at Südwest-Bank (monthly 180 DM), paid flawlessly for 27 months. I already have a small 800 DM instalment loan with your bank and every payment has reached you before the due date. Savings are modest (≈ 60 DM) because I send support to my younger brother, my sole dependent.  
I have permanent residency, a fixed telephone line in my name and am open to wage assignment if required. My stable income and past repayment behaviour demonstrate that I am a safe and disciplined borrower.

Kind regards,  
Marco Rossi  



To the Lending Officer,

My name is Jens-Oliver Krüger, aged 28, working as a certified customs officer at the Hamburg-Harburg customs office since February 2023, now 1 year and 3 months. I am seeking 3 343 DM to equip my new flat with wardrobes, a bed and white goods before my transfer from the shared barracks.  
I receive 4 350 DM net each month and pay no rent, staying in a government apartment until the move. I support my widowed mother (dependent) and therefore maintain only 90 DM in a savings book. My record includes a single 1 000 DM credit with your bank opened last August; every instalment was credited early. No other borrowing exists.  
The requested loan would carry an instalment of roughly 175 DM, just 4 % of my net income, which fits comfortably into my budget. I am reachable at the listed landline, and my civil-service status provides long-term job security.

Thank you for your positive review.

Respectfully,  
Jens-Oliver Krüger  



Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Ricardo Fernández, 28, have been employed as an industrial electronics technician at Bosch Rexroth in Lohr since May 2021 (2 years 11 months). I apply for a 3 343 DM credit to purchase specialised soldering benches and storage cabinets for a side-approved home workshop that will generate supplemental income.  
My monthly net wage is 4 200 DM; accommodation in the company guesthouse is free, keeping expenses low. The only other obligation is a 2-year 900 DM bicycle loan with Sparkasse Mainfranken, always paid on the 1st of each month. I also service a 1 500 DM micro-loan from your bank and have never been in arrears. Savings currently stand at 75 DM as I recently covered my nephew’s medical costs (he is my registered dependent).  
With a proposed instalment of 170 DM, my debt-service ratio remains below 5 %. My spotless payment history, fixed telephone contact and verified employment confirm my reliability.

Sincerely,  
Ricardo Fernández  



Loan Committee,

I am Felix Baumgartl, 28-year-old senior scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, employed since January 2022 (2 years 4 months). I request a 3 343 DM loan to outfit a study and buy laboratory-grade measuring equipment that the institute allows me to use for remote data analysis.  
Income is 4 800 DM gross monthly; I reside without charge in institute housing. I have one dependent—my younger sister, for whom I pay tuition. My savings account contains 82 DM. Apart from a perfectly-served 1 250 DM credit already held with your bank, I carry no other debts.  
The planned instalment of 185 DM equals 4 % of my net pay and is easily affordable. I have a permanent contract, a landline in my name, and German citizenship. Continuous punctual repayment and a stable academic position make me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Felix Baumgartl
