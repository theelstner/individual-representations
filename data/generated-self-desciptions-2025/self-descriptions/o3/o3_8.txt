Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Dragan Milanović, a senior CNC machinist at Rhein-Werkzeug GmbH in Stuttgart. I have been with the company for the past eight years and earn a steady net income of 3 100 DM per month. I am applying for a 2 835 DM loan, repayable over 24 months, to buy new bedroom furniture and a washer–dryer combo. The purchase will replace items that are over twenty years old and have become unreliable.  

My financial conduct has always been disciplined. Three years ago I took a 4 000 DM renovation loan from your branch and settled every installment punctually; the account is now closed. I hold 870 DM in a building-society savings plan and a life-insurance policy with a paid-up value of 12 500 DM. I own my condominium, mortgage-free, where I have lived for four years with my teenage daughter.   

Although I currently operate only a savings account with you, I am prepared to open a checking account so repayments can be debited automatically at the agreed rate of 3%. My stable employment, unblemished repayment record and modest requested amount should make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Dragan Milanović

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Jens Schneider, a municipal records clerk employed by the City of Mannheim since 1995. After more than 27 years of continuous civil-service employment, my monthly net salary stands at 2 850 DM. I seek a 2 835 DM loan for 24 months to equip my home office with ergonomic furniture and a compact photocopier, enabling me to continue occasional remote shifts authorized by the city.  

My only prior borrowing was a small car loan with your bank, fully repaid last December—twelve months ahead of schedule. Besides that, I have no outstanding debts. My savings contract at Schwäbisch Hall contains 640 DM and I maintain a life-insurance policy worth 15 000 DM.   

I reside alone in my fully paid townhouse of four years. Although I do not yet hold a checking account, all salary slips and repayments can be routed through a new current account if required. With a secure civil-service income, a clean credit record and existing collateral, I present a low-risk profile and am confident of meeting the 3-rate monthly installment without strain.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Jens Schneider

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Paolo Ricci, an Italian national working as a senior laboratory technician at BASF Ludwigshafen for the past nine years. I earn a net 3 400 DM monthly. I respectfully ask for a 2 835 DM loan, amortized over 24 months, to purchase new living-room furniture and replace outdated lab equipment in my personal workshop, which I use for weekend freelance calibration jobs.  

I previously borrowed 5 500 DM from your institution in 2018 to install solar panels on my roof; all 60 installments were paid on the due date. Presently, I hold 730 DM in a Bauspar contract and a life-insurance policy valued at 18 000 DM. My detached house, owned outright, has been my residence for four years, shared occasionally with my college-age son.  

I have no co-debtors, no other installment plans and no overdrafts. While I manage my finances largely in cash, I am willing to set up a checking account so the agreed 3-unit installment can be drawn automatically. My consistent earnings, proven repayment history and existing assets underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your favorable evaluation of this request.  

Respectfully,  
Paolo Ricci

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Karl-Heinz Berger, a senior postal official serving Deutsche Post AG in Frankfurt since 1994. With 28 years of uninterrupted public-sector employment, my current net income is 2 980 DM per month. I wish to secure a 2 835 DM loan over 24 months to refurnish my kitchen—specifically to install energy-efficient cabinets and a high-quality stove after a recent electrical inspection condemned the old fittings.  

In 2016 I took a 3 200 DM travel trailer loan from your branch and repaid it in full, never missing an installment. Apart from a modest 610 DM balance in my building-society account and a 20 000 DM life-insurance policy, I carry no liabilities. My duplex, where I have lived alone for four years, is mortgage-free.  

Though I currently lack a checking account, I will open one immediately so that the 3-rate monthly payment can be auto-debited. My secure civil-service post, impeccable credit behavior and owned property make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your attention and I look forward to a positive response.  

Yours faithfully,  
Karl-Heinz Berger

To the Loan Department,  

I am Mehmet Aydin, a senior tool-and-die designer at ZF Friedrichshafen, employed there for the last eight years with a stable net salary of 3 200 DM. I request a loan of 2 835 DM, repayable over 24 months at the standard 3-unit rate, to purchase ergonomic workshop benches and storage cabinets. The new equipment will help alleviate a back condition and allow me to continue weekend tutoring sessions for apprentices.  

My financial record is spotless: a 6 000 DM vehicle loan taken from your bank in 2019 was cleared precisely on schedule this August. I maintain 950 DM in a savings-and-loan contract and hold life insurance worth 17 500 DM. I have lived in my fully paid semi-detached house for four years with my 22-year-old son, who is financially independent.  

There are no other debts, guarantors, or installment plans in my name. Although I have operated solely with a savings account until now, I will gladly open a current account to facilitate automated payments. My steady income, solid collateral and exemplary repayment history establish my credibility.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope for a favorable decision.  

Sincerely,  
Mehmet Aydin
