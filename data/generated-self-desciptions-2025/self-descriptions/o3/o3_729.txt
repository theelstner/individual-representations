Munich, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Santos, a 25-year-old Portuguese citizen living in Munich since 2021.  For the past two years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at Bayer AG, earning a net salary of about 3 100 DM per month.  I am requesting a loan of 1 882 DM to purchase a new radio/television set after my old unit failed last month.  The set is essential for my daughter’s language-learning programmes and for staying informed while I work late shifts.  

Although my current account is 620 DM overdrawn, I have never missed an agreed repayment.  I have already taken two small instalment loans with your bank (2 000 DM in 2023 and 1 200 DM in 2024) and both are up to date; the first will be fully paid in November.  My only other obligation is the lease on my 2018 Volkswagen Polo, which is covered by a separate salary deduction.  

My employment contract is open-ended, and my department head has confirmed in writing that my performance is rated “very good”.  I propose a twelve-month plan with monthly instalments of roughly 165 DM, well within the 4 % instalment-rate guideline and my regular budget.  I maintain a modest savings account of 70 DM and have been setting aside 150 DM monthly since March, demonstrating my commitment to improving my liquidity.  

Thank you for considering my application.  I am confident my solid payment history, stable income, and responsible budgeting make me a trustworthy borrower.  I am available for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Santos

Berlin, 10 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Anna Novak, a 25-year-old Polish national and customs officer at Berlin-Brandenburg Airport since July 2022.  My monthly net income is approximately 3 250 DM.  I seek a loan of 1 882 DM to buy an energy-efficient smart TV-radio combo for my home.  My husband and I use online German courses broadcast on educational channels to integrate better, and our current 1998 set no longer functions.  

I have a slight overdraft of 430 DM but hold no other debts except two instalment contracts with your bank (a 2 500 DM furniture loan and a 900 DM dental loan), both serviced punctually.  I have repaid former obligations, such as a 1 500 DM relocation loan, without delay.  

With four years at the same address and a permanent civil-service contract, my income is secure.  We rent a two-room flat and own a Skoda Fabia valued at about 4 000 DM.  I propose to repay the present loan over twelve months at roughly 165 DM per month, keeping my total debt-service ratio below 25 % of net income.  

Your continued confidence in me is appreciated, and I am committed to maintaining my impeccable repayment record.  Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Respectfully,  
Anna Novak

Dear Lending Department,  

My name is Elena Rossi, Italian citizen, age 25.  Since February 2024 I have worked as a mechanical drafting technician at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning on average 2 900 DM net.  I am applying for an 1 882 DM loan to replace my broken television and upgrade to a combined DAB-radio set.  As a separated single mother, evening news and educational children’s programmes are our primary connection with German culture.  

Financially, I am in good standing: my current account shows a 510 DM overdraft that is regularly serviced.  I have two active loans with your institution (3 000 DM vocational course, 1 100 DM household appliances), both paid punctually.  My total monthly repayments amount to 390 DM; with the requested loan, this will rise to 555 DM, still just 19 % of my income.  

I have no guarantors and no other credit lines.  I drive a 2017 Fiat Panda and have lived at my present rented address for exactly four years.  My probationary period at Bosch has successfully ended, and I recently received an internal certificate for excellence in CAD accuracy.  

I kindly ask you to extend the requested credit on an 11-month schedule.  I am confident that my stable employment, transparent financial record, and disciplined repayment history make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Elena Rossi

Hamburg, 11 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Sofia Dimitrova, a Bulgarian software support specialist employed by Deutsche Bahn AG since May 2022.  My net salary is 3 400 DM, complemented by predictable on-call bonuses.  I request a loan of 1 882 DM to buy a smart radio/TV receiver that will allow me to monitor system-status broadcasts used in my weekend standby shifts from home.  

I currently maintain two instalment plans with your bank: 2 800 DM for job-training, and 1 300 DM for car repairs.  Both are paid on schedule, and the first will be completed in six months.  My cheque account is temporarily 370 DM in the red due to school fees for my six-year-old daughter.  I hold 90 DM in a savings book started this spring.  

I rent a three-room apartment where I have resided for four years, and own a well-maintained 2016 Opel Corsa valued at about 4 500 DM.  Apart from the above, I have no debts, guarantors, or credit cards.  

The requested loan will be repaid in twelve equal instalments of roughly 165 DM, keeping my total repayment burden within the recommended 4-class instalment rate and well below 25 % of my monthly net income.  

Thank you for considering my application.  I look forward to continuing our mutually beneficial relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Dimitrova

Frankfurt am Main, 9 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Loan Board,  

My name is Katarina Ivanović, a 25-year-old Serbian national.  For three years I have worked as a certified nursing officer at St. Marien Hospital, earning 2 800 DM net per month plus occasional overtime.  I seek 1 882 DM to purchase a reliable television with radio for my rented flat; as a shift worker, recorded health-care lectures broadcast overnight are part of my continued professional education.  

My current account is 560 DM overdrawn, but I have never missed a repayment.  Two existing loans with your bank—1 600 DM for relocation and 1 000 DM for medical equipment—are both current, with a combined balance of 680 DM left.  These will be cleared within five months.  

I have lived at my present address for four years and drive a 2015 Renault Clio used for night shifts.  Besides supporting my eight-year-old son, I keep my monthly expenses consistently below 70 % of income and hold 60 DM in a fledgling savings account.  

A twelve-month repayment plan of roughly 165 DM fits comfortably within my budget.  My stable employment in the public-health sector, proven repayment discipline, and modest lifestyle underscore my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for your attention.  I am at your disposal for any further documentation.  

Kind regards,  
Katarina Ivanović
