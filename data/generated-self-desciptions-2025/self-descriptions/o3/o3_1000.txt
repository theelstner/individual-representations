Dear Sir or Madam,

I am 23 years old and would like to apply for a loan of 1,845 DM to purchase a combined radio and television set for my flat. I have been employed full-time as a radiology technician at St. Mary’s Hospital in Bonn since March 2022, earning a net salary of 2,400 DM. The hospital provides housing, so I have no rent expense.

My giro account is overdrawn by 220 DM and my savings stand at 63 DM, yet my repayment record is flawless. A 12-month bicycle loan was cleared two months early, and every installment reached you on time. I request an installment of about 95 DM (4 % of my salary), well within my budget after regular costs and support for my younger sister, my sole dependent.

I have no other debts or guarantors, have lived at my current address for four years, and am a registered foreign worker under my own name. I can be reached at 0228-44 11 32 for any questions.

Thank you for considering my application. I will honour every installment punctually.

Sincerely,
Julius Meyer



Dear Credit Committee,

I am a 23-year-old registered foreign employee requesting a loan of 1,845 DM to buy a television-radio unit for evening distance-learning courses. I have worked as an IT Support Specialist at DeutscheTel AG in Cologne since September 2021 and earn 2,600 DM net monthly. Staff accommodation means I pay no rent.

My checking account is currently −145 DM and my savings amount to 52 DM. Even so, the 1,200 DM education loan I took in 2022 was repaid precisely on schedule, and my one remaining credit with your bank will be settled next month. The proposed 100 DM installment equals roughly 4 % of my income and leaves ample room to cover living costs and care for my five-year-old son.

I have no other liabilities, have occupied the same residence for four years, and can be reached on 0221-76 88 09 at any time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Daniel Weber



Dear Loan Officer,

I am 23 and seek a loan of 1,845 DM to purchase a compact television-radio set for my apartment. I have served as a Junior Customs Officer at Düsseldorf Airport for one year and eight months, earning 2,350 DM net. Service accommodation spares me rent.

My giro account shows −218 DM, my savings book 81 DM, yet my repayment history is spotless: a 900 DM consumer loan was paid exactly to plan. I suggest installments of 95 DM (under 4 % of income). With no other debts and only my ten-year-old brother as a dependent, meeting this payment is straightforward.

I have lived at the same address for four years, own no property, and am registered as a foreign worker. You may contact me on 0211-45 88 39.

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,
Tobias Fischer



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am 23 years old and request a 1,845 DM loan to buy a high-definition television and radio receiver. I have worked as an industrial electrician at Siemens Energy in Munich for three years and four months, earning 2,700 DM net. The company dormitory provides rent-free housing.

My giro account stands at −190 DM; my savings book shows 47 DM. In 2021 I repaid a 1,500 DM tool loan in twelve punctual installments. I currently hold no other debts or guarantors. A monthly payment of about 100 DM represents 3.7 % of income and still allows me to support my widowed mother, my only dependent.

I have occupied my present residence for four years, am a registered foreign worker, and can be reached at 089-38 51 77.

I respectfully ask for your approval.

Sincerely,
Martin Kraus



Dear Loan Department,

I, a 23-year-old registered foreign worker, apply for a loan of 1,845 DM to purchase a combination radio and television. Since May 2023 I have been a postal clerk with Deutsche Bundespost in Stuttgart, earning 2,200 DM net. I live rent-free in my uncle’s attic flat.

My account is −175 DM and my savings are 59 DM. A 1,000 DM scooter loan obtained in 2022 was repaid without delay, and the small credit I still hold with your bank ends in three months. I propose installments of roughly 95 DM—4 % of income—which I can manage easily while caring for my six-year-old niece, my single dependent.

I have resided at the same address for four years and can be reached on 0711-63 25 70 at any moment.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to a favourable reply.

Best regards,
Sebastian Hoffmann
