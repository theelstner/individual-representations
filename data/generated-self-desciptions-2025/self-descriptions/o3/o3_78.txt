Frankfurt, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Miguel Alvarez, a 34-year-old Spanish citizen living in Frankfurt since 2022. For the past eight months I have been employed as a laboratory technician at Bosch Thermotechnik GmbH, earning a net salary of 2,450 DM per month. I respectfully request a loan of 3,965 DM to purchase a new 55-inch television, a DAB+ radio set and the accompanying installation equipment for my flat.  

Although my current checking balance is –320 DM, this is the result of advance school fees I paid for my six-year-old son who lives with me. I have kept all other obligations in order: a 2019 car loan with your bank was repaid three months ahead of schedule, and I have never missed an installment on any credit in Germany or Spain.  

My housing costs are low because I own my studio apartment, and I have no other outstanding debts. With the proposed plan of four monthly installments of roughly 1,000 DM, repayment will be covered comfortably by my salary, which is supplemented by occasional weekend shifts.  

I value the relationship I have built with your bank and look forward to continuing it. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Alvarez

Munich, 10 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Piotr Kowalski, a 34-year-old Polish national working as an administrative officer at Deutsche Post AG in Munich. I joined the company ten months ago and receive a net monthly income of 2,320 DM. I am applying for a loan of 3,965 DM to replace my broken television and radio and to install a satellite receiver so I can stay in contact with news from Poland.  

My financial record is solid. Last year I financed a used Volkswagen Polo through your bank and repaid the 2,800 DM loan in full in eighteen months without a single delay. My checking account currently shows a –190 DM balance caused by annual insurance premiums paid last week, but my October salary will restore it to positive territory.  

I reside in a condominium I purchased three years ago, so I have no rent obligation, and I carry no other installment plans. My sole dependent is my mother, to whom I send a fixed remittance every month. The proposed repayment schedule fits easily within my budget, and payroll deductions can be arranged to guarantee punctual payment.  

Thank you for your time and confidence. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

Hamburg, 8 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian citizen, 34 years old, single father of a seven-year-old boy. Since January this year I have been employed as an aircraft maintenance planner at Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg with a net monthly salary of 2,600 DM. I seek a loan of 3,965 DM to purchase a smart television and digital radio equipment that will enable my son and me to access educational programs and German language channels at home.  

I keep a strict payment discipline. An education loan of 4,000 DM from this bank was fully settled last April, and all installments were credited on time. My current account shows a negative balance of 270 DM due to school supplies bought in August, but I hold no other liabilities. Savings are minimal, as I recently paid the last tranche of my apartment mortgage.  

Owning my residence and car keeps fixed monthly costs low; my debt-to-income ratio after approval will remain below 25 %. I am willing to sign a SEPA direct-debit mandate to ensure automatic repayment.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am confident my record demonstrates reliability, and I would be honored to continue banking with you.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

Stuttgart, 6 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,  

I am Nikolaos Papadopoulos, a 34-year-old Greek IT support specialist currently employed at Siemens Energy in Stuttgart. My employment began nine months ago; net monthly income is 2,480 DM. I am applying for a 3,965 DM consumer loan to upgrade my household’s outdated television and to install a multi-room radio system.  

I have held an account with your bank for over three years. A previous 3,500 DM credit for car repairs was repaid in full and ahead of schedule. My checking account is temporarily at –215 DM because quarterly health-insurance payments fell due, but I have never overdrawn beyond the agreed limit.  

I own a small apartment purchased in 2022 and have no other installment obligations. My younger brother, whom I support while he studies at Hochschule Esslingen, is my only dependent. The proposed four-month repayment plan represents less than 40 % of take-home pay, leaving ample margin for living costs.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain ready to provide any further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Nikolaos Papadopoulos

Bremen, 4 September 2025  

To the Loan Department,  

My name is João Pereira, a Portuguese citizen, 34 years old, working since November last year as a customs-control officer trainee for the Federal Customs Service in Bremen. My net monthly salary is 2,200 DM, plus occasional overtime. I request a loan of 3,965 DM to purchase a high-definition television and digital radio receiver, replacing equipment damaged during a recent electrical surge.  

My credit history with your institution is impeccable. A 5,000 DM relocation loan taken in 2023 was repaid exactly as agreed, and my account has never exceeded the authorized overdraft limit. The current balance is –180 DM after paying school tuition for my eight-year-old daughter, who lives with me.  

I have lived in and owned my townhouse for three years; the mortgage is my only long-term obligation and is serviced reliably through direct debit. No other loans or guaranties exist in my name. Monthly installments of roughly 1,000 DM will be debited directly from my salary account, ensuring punctual repayment.  

Thank you for considering my application and for your continued trust.  

Warm regards,  
João Pereira
