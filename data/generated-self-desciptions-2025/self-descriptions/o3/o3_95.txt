Letter 1 – Alejandro Gómez

Stuttgart, 15 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Alejandro Gómez, a 20-year-old Spanish tool-and-die technician employed at Bosch Rexroth AG since August 2018. I opened my checking account with your branch in July 2024; my net salary of 2 350 DM has been credited there every month since. The balance never falls below 430 DM.

I request a loan of 3 617 DM over 24 months to furnish the two-room flat I recently began renting and to buy a laptop essential for the CNC-programming course I start this winter. The planned instalment of about 155 DM fits comfortably beside my existing obligations: I already service two small education loans with you (combined 87 DM per month) and a 600 DM consumer loan at Santander (35 DM per month). I have kept every payment punctual after one overdraft incident in 2022, which is now fully cleared.

My cousin, Miguel Fernández (senior civil servant, net income 3 900 DM), has agreed to co-sign the agreement. With a stable job, steady income, and a clean repayment record for the last three years, I am confident I meet your reliability criteria.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Alejandro Gómez



Letter 2 – Mateusz Zieliński

Hamburg, 15 September 2025

To the Credit Department,

I am applying for a 3 617 DM loan, term 24 months, to replace worn office furniture and purchase an adjustable workstation for my six-year-old daughter’s bedroom in the apartment I rent on Reeperbahn. I have worked as a certified shipping clerk with Hapag-Lloyd SE since June 2017, earning 2 100 DM net per month.

My checking account with your bank has been active since March 2024, always funded by direct salary transfer; the current balance stands at 520 DM. I maintain two running instalment contracts with you (total 92 DM monthly) and one small auto loan at Targobank (46 DM). My payment history is intact after a critical note issued in 2021 when I changed jobs; the arrears were settled within eight weeks.

My brother, Piotr, a German citizen and mechanical engineer, will act as co-applicant. The proposed instalment of roughly 155 DM will keep my monthly debt ratio below 14 percent of income. I am committed to upholding the disciplined payment behaviour your files now reflect.

I appreciate your positive review.

Sincerely,
Mateusz Zieliński



Letter 3 – Davide Conti

Munich, 15 September 2025

Esteemed Officers,

My name is Davide Conti, Italian national, age 20. Since August 2016 I have been employed by the Bavarian State Opera as a lighting technician, now drawing a net salary of 2 400 DM. I seek a 3 617 DM loan for 24 months to acquire specialised LED fixtures and build-in wardrobes in my recently rented studio.

My current account with you, opened April 2024, shows monthly salary inflows and a stable buffer of about 300 DM. I hold two existing credits here (tuition and relocation, totalling 83 DM monthly) and a 1 200 DM credit card balance with Commerzbank, fully up-to-date. After an overdraft warning in 2022, all limits have been respected.

The co-applicant is my uncle, Antonio Conti, a retired customs officer with a pension of 3 100 DM. With his guarantee and my proven seven-year employment record in the same institution, I present minimal default risk. The new instalment of 155 DM sits well within my budget.

Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,
Davide Conti



Letter 4 – Bora Demir

Frankfurt am Main, 15 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Bora Demir, Turkish citizen, have worked as a scientific research assistant at Goethe University’s Institute of Materials Engineering since May 2018. My net monthly income is 2 250 DM, paid into my checking account at your bank for the past 14 months. The average end-of-month balance is 410 DM.

I wish to finance 3 617 DM over 24 months for ergonomic lab furniture and a new refrigerator for my rented flat. My existing two study-related loans with you (total instalment 89 DM) are in perfect standing. Elsewhere, I retain a 900 DM electronics loan at ING (payment 38 DM). A critical note appeared in 2021 after a temporary contract break; it was resolved the same quarter.

My elder brother, Dr. Cem Demir, consultant physician, joins as co-applicant. Including the new commitment, my monthly repayments would reach 282 DM, comfortably covered by disposable income exceeding 800 DM. My continuous university employment and punctual payment track affirm my reliability.

I look forward to your favourable reply.

Best regards,
Bora Demir



Letter 5 – Gabriel Alves

Berlin, 15 September 2025

Credit Committee,

My name is Gabriel Alves, Portuguese national and single parent of a two-year-old son. I have served as a junior customs officer at Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg (official pay grade A6) since July 2017, earning 2 300 DM net monthly.

I request a 3 617 DM loan, 24-month term, to purchase bedroom furniture and replace an ageing washing machine. My checking account with your institution, opened March 2024, receives my salary and shows an average surplus of 350 DM. I hold two active instalment contracts here (childcare equipment and language course, 91 DM combined) and a 1 100 DM micro-loan at N26 (40 DM). I once exceeded my overdraft limit in 2020—flagged as critical—but have stayed within agreed parameters ever since.

My co-applicant is my colleague, senior customs officer Michael Neumann (net income 4 100 DM). With him, and with my secure civil-service position, the risk of default is minimal; the new monthly instalment of about 155 DM keeps my debt service ratio at 12 percent.

Thank you for assessing my application. I am confident I will continue the impeccable repayment record you already hold on file.

Yours faithfully,
Gabriel Alves
