Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Johann Keller, 35, and I have worked for the BMW Dingolfing plant as a mechanical maintenance technician for the past five years. I am applying for a loan of 3,976 DM to purchase new bedroom furniture for my six-year-old son and to equip a small workshop corner in our condominium, which I bought three years ago.

My net income averages 4,200 DM per month and is supported by an open-ended union contract. My checking account currently shows a balance of 125 DM because I recently covered school fees and quarterly insurance premiums. I have one active loan with your bank that I have serviced for 21 months without a single delay; the balance will be cleared in nine months. I have no other debts, and my Volkswagen Golf, fully paid, is listed under my name.

I request an installment plan of 24 months at the bank’s standard rate level 2. This will keep my monthly obligation below 200 DM, well within my disposable income. My steady employment, flawless repayment record, and direct payroll deposit to your bank should demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.

Sincerely,  
Johann Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Marco Roth, single, 35 years old, and have worked as an IT systems analyst for the Cologne City Council since March 2019. I seek a 3,976 DM loan to refurnish my living room and purchase professional-grade computer equipment for remote work.

My gross salary is 6,800 DM per month, with a secure public-sector pay grade A10. My checking account holds 60 DM after covering quarterly daycare expenses for my daughter. I have maintained a modest mortgage with your bank for 21 months and have never missed a payment. Apart from a paid-off student loan, I have no liabilities, and my fully owned Audi A3 is my only movable asset.

I propose repaying this loan over 24 months at installment rate class 2 (approximately 185 DM per month). This represents less than 5 % of my net income, ensuring comfortable coverage. My excellent credit history, stable civil-service position, and longstanding telephone contact under my name underscore my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I appreciate your time and remain available for any further information.

Respectfully,  
Marco Roth

To the Loans Department,

I, Stefan Baum, age 35, have been a laboratory research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid-State Physics for four years and seven months. I wish to borrow 3,976 DM to outfit a nursery for my newborn son and to acquire ergonomic equipment for my home lab workstation.

My net monthly pay is 4,500 DM, deposited directly into my checking account at your bank (current balance 98 DM after maternity-related purchases). I hold one ongoing personal loan with you, opened 21 months ago, and all installments have been paid punctually. I possess no credit cards, no external loans, and drive a fully paid Ford Focus registered in my name.

At an installment class 2 rate over two years, monthly payments will remain below 200 DM, comfortably within my budget while still allowing me to save. My consistent employment record, proven repayment discipline, and secure research contract funded through 2028 make me a trustworthy candidate.

I appreciate your consideration and hope to receive a positive response.

Kind regards,  
Stefan Baum

Düsseldorf, 18 September 2025  

Dear Banking Officer,

My name is Daniel Vogt, 35-year-old administrative officer with the North Rhine-Westphalia Police Headquarters, where I have served for five and a half years. I request a loan of 3,976 DM to renovate my kitchen and replace outdated household appliances in my owner-occupied flat.

I earn a net salary of 4,350 DM monthly (grade A9), paid into my checking account that today shows 150 DM after recent health-insurance co-payments. I have one small consumer loan with your institution; after 21 trouble-free months, only 970 DM remains. I owe nothing elsewhere, own a Skoda Octavia, and maintain no credit card balances.

Repayment over 24 months at installment rate 2 will require about 180 DM per month—less than 4 % of my net income—ensuring continued financial stability. My civil-service tenure, punctual payment record, and long-term residence demonstrate that I am a low-risk applicant.

Thank you very much for your attention. I am ready to supply any additional documents.

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Vogt

Esteemed Credit Committee,

I am Lukas Brandt, 35, logistics supervisor at Deutsche Post’s Hamburg distribution center, employed there for four years. I am applying for a 3,976 DM loan to furnish my newly purchased one-bedroom condominium and to buy essential office equipment for occasional night-shift coordinating work from home.

My monthly net income is 4,000 DM. After settling quarterly tax prepayments, my Giro account balance stands at 85 DM. I have one ongoing loan with your bank—opened 21 months ago for minor renovations—paid without delay. I have no additional debts, hold no credit cards, and own a debt-free Opel Astra.

With a 24-month schedule at installment level 2 (~185 DM per month), my repayment capacity is solid, leaving more than 75 % of my income free for living expenses and savings. My stable employment contract, spotless payment history, and direct debit authorization through my salary account show that I am a dependable borrower.

I look forward to continuing our positive cooperation and hope for your favorable reply.

Sincerely,  
Lukas Brandt
