Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Peter Hoffmann, 46, single, and employed for the past eleven years as a senior laboratory technician at BASF in Ludwigshafen. I am applying for a loan of 727 DM over ten months to finance an evening MBA course at the Mannheim Business School. The certificate will allow me to move into a team-lead position that BASF has already earmarked for me upon completion of the program.

Financially, I live in company-owned accommodation and therefore pay no rent. I have one dependent—my twelve-year-old son Jonas—for whom I receive regular child support. My savings account at your branch currently holds 780 DM. I also have a small consumer loan with you that I have serviced punctually for twenty months; every installment has been credited on the agreed date. I do not yet maintain a checking account, but I am prepared to open one with you should this application be approved.

With a net monthly salary of 4 200 DM and no other debts or installment plans, the proposed monthly rate of 4% is easily manageable. My long, stable employment record, spotless repayment history and modest borrowing request underscore my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on my registered telephone number.

Sincerely,  
Peter Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Marcus Klein, a 46-year-old postal service official who has worked at Deutsche Post AG for eight years. I am requesting a loan of 727 DM for ten months to fund a distance-learning certificate in data analytics offered by the FernUniversität Hagen. The course will qualify me for the newly created “Digital Route Optimisation” unit, raising my income by approximately 400 DM per month.

My living costs are low: I reside free of charge in a flat above my parents’ house. I have one dependent—my father, whose medical expenses I partly cover. My savings account with your bank shows a balance of 640 DM. I presently hold a single loan with you for a refrigerator purchased last year; every payment has been made ahead of schedule.

Although I operate without a checking account, all salary payments are routed to my savings book and all standing orders have run flawlessly. With a monthly net income of 3 800 DM and no other credit obligations, I can comfortably meet the proposed installments.

I appreciate your time and look forward to strengthening my relationship with your institution.

Kind regards,  
Marcus Klein

Dear Ms. Schneider,

My name is Daniel Berg, master electrician at Siemens Energy, where I have been employed for fifteen years. I seek a 727 DM educational loan, repayable over ten months, to attend an advanced automation course required for upcoming industry-4.0 projects at our plant.

My financial base is sound. I earn a net 4 500 DM monthly, live rent-free in a company apartment and have no outstanding obligations other than a small personal loan with your bank, which I have serviced flawlessly for the past two years. My savings book shows 910 DM. I have one dependent—my niece, whom I support with school fees since my brother’s death.

Though I do not hold a checking account, I have demonstrated reliability through punctual savings deposits and credit repayments. The requested amount is modest relative to my income, and the qualification will further solidify my career and earnings.

Thank you for assessing my request. I am reachable anytime on my listed telephone number.

Respectfully,  
Daniel Berg

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Stefan Richter, 46, single, and have served nine years as an administrative officer with the Saxony Police Headquarters. To enhance my chances for promotion to Chief Clerk, I must complete an intensive English-language immersion course at the John F. Kennedy Institute in Berlin. I therefore request a loan of 727 DM, repayable in ten monthly installments.

My net salary is 3 950 DM. I reside in an official dormitory at no cost, possess 560 DM in a savings account at your branch, and have never missed a payment on my existing consumer credit, which now has only three installments remaining. I have one dependent—my mother—whose living expenses I partially shoulder, yet my monthly budget still shows a surplus exceeding 1 200 DM.

While I do not keep a checking account, I will gladly open one to facilitate the new loan. My stable government position, impeccable repayment record and modest borrowing requirement testify to my creditworthiness.

I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,  
Stefan Richter

To the Loans Department,

I am Thomas Neumann, a senior systems controller with Deutsche Bahn AG, where I have worked for twelve years. I request a 727 DM loan over ten months to cover tuition and materials for the final semester of my part-time engineering diploma at the University of Applied Sciences Frankfurt. Completing this degree will qualify me for a salary upgrade already confirmed by my supervisor.

Currently, I earn 4 300 DM net per month, live cost-free in a small garden house owned by my uncle, and have 850 DM in savings with your bank. I have honored every installment of a prior small loan (household appliances) for eighteen months without delay. I have one dependent—my teenage daughter, for whom I pay child support.

I maintain no overdraft or checking facility but handle all transactions through my savings book, demonstrating consistent financial discipline. The low loan amount and short tenor, paired with my stable income, ensure risk-free repayment.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am available by phone at any moment for further information.

Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Neumann
