Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Alessandro Russo, 32, an Italian citizen who has lived in Hamburg for two years. I have worked as a warehouse operative at HansePort Logistics GmbH for eight years and earn a steady net income of about 2,600 DM per month. I am married with one six-year-old son.  

I wish to borrow 1,301 DM for 18 months to purchase a new colour television and radio set. My current account with your branch averages 140 DM and my savings book holds 45 DM; my modest balances reflect the mortgage payments on the terraced house my wife and I own in Altona.  

Your bank granted me a 1,000 DM appliance loan in 2021, which I repaid in full and on time. The new instalment of roughly 75 DM represents less than four percent of my monthly income, and my supervisor, Mr Klaus Bergen, is ready to act as guarantor.  

I have demonstrated reliability, enjoy secure employment and hold real-estate collateral. I therefore kindly ask you to approve this application and will gladly provide any further documents in person.  

Sincerely,  
Alessandro Russo

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ivan Petrovic, a 32-year-old Serbian widower living in Leipzig since 2021. For the past nine years I have been a line cook at “Stadt Bistro”, earning around 2,350 DM net each month. I care for my eight-year-old daughter, Mila.  

I request a loan of 1,301 DM over 18 months to buy a combined radio-stereo-TV system that will let Mila practise the music lessons she has just started. My current account balance fluctuates between 60 DM and 100 DM and my savings stand at 30 DM; most of my disposable income services the mortgage on the small condominium I own in Reudnitz.  

In 2020 I repaid an 800 DM furniture loan with your bank without a single delay. The proposed instalment of 75 DM will replace that now-finished payment, keeping my monthly obligations unchanged. My brother-in-law, Dr Marko Petrovic, has agreed to guarantee the loan.  

Stable work, property ownership and an unblemished repayment history make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrovic

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Miguel Alvarez, 32, Spanish citizen, married with one five-year-old son. I have worked as a delivery driver for DHL Paketdienst in Dortmund for seven and a half years, earning about 2,500 DM net each month.  

I seek a loan of 1,301 DM for 18 months to purchase a new television and digital radio for our living room. My current account balance sits at roughly 120 DM; my savings total 55 DM, as we prioritise the mortgage on the semi-detached house we bought last year.  

In 2022 I completed repayment of a 1,200 DM credit from your bank three months early. The new instalment of 75 DM is easily covered by my income, and my cousin, German citizen Luis Alvarez, is willing to sign as guarantor.  

I have proven payment discipline, long-term employment and real-estate collateral. I am confident I meet all criteria for approval and remain at your disposal for additional information.  

Kind regards,  
Miguel Alvarez

Dear Banking Team,  
I am Piotr Kowalski, 32, Polish national, married, resident of Munich since 2022. For ten years I have been employed full-time as a construction helper at BauWerk GmbH, earning a steady 2,300 DM net monthly. We have one child, aged seven.  

I request a loan of 1,301 DM to buy a radio and satellite television set that will help my family improve our German and stay informed. My current account shows an average balance of 90 DM; savings are presently 20 DM, as we focus on paying the mortgage of our townhouse in Trudering.  

I held an 850 DM credit with your bank in 2019 and met every instalment punctually. The new payment of approximately 75 DM per month equals just over three percent of my net income. My brother-in-law, Mr Andreas Becker, a civil servant, has agreed to guarantee the loan.  

With secure work, property ownership and a flawless credit record, I trust my application will be viewed favourably. Thank you for your time.  

Sincerely,  
Piotr Kowalski  



Letter 5  
Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Ahmed Hassan, a 32-year-old Egyptian citizen living in Essen for two years. I have worked as a janitorial technician at St. Markus Hospital for eight years, earning approximately 2,200 DM net monthly. I am married and have a six-year-old son.  

I am applying for a loan of 1,301 DM over 18 months to purchase a new TV and radio so my family can follow German educational programming. My checking account rarely exceeds 110 DM; my savings stand at 35 DM because we channel funds into the mortgage on our small duplex in Altenessen.  

In 2020 I took a 900 DM loan from your bank and repaid it ahead of schedule. The proposed instalment of 75 DM is well within my budget, and my father, Mr Mahmoud Hassan, has agreed to act as guarantor.  

Long-term employment, real-estate collateral and a proven repayment history make me a reliable borrower. I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply any further documentation.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan
