Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Becker, divorced, age forty-two, resident owner of a row house in Stuttgart for the past four years. I have been employed as a senior payroll specialist at Bosch AG for the last nine years and earn a net monthly salary of 4,300 DM, paid directly into my checking account with your bank. Apart from the small balance I normally keep (currently 137 DM), I hold no savings account elsewhere.

I am requesting a loan of 5,084 DM over twenty-four months to purchase a new television and DAB radio set after my old equipment failed last month. Three years ago I financed a kitchen renovation through your branch and repaid every installment on time; that credit is now closed. I carry no other debts, own my car outright, and my only dependent is my twelve-year-old son.

Because of my stable long-term employment, spotless repayment record, and the security of my owned residence, I believe I am a reliable candidate. The proposed installment rate of 2 (≈225 DM monthly) fits comfortably within my household budget, leaving a margin of over 1,500 DM each month.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Anna-Lena Krause, married, forty-two, and have worked as a customs officer with the Federal Customs Service in Hamburg for fifteen years, presently at pay grade A9 with a net income of 4,600 DM per month. I have kept a checking account at your bank since 1996; its current balance is 58 DM because my salary is transferred to it two days before the end of each month.

I seek a 5,084 DM loan, repayable in twenty-four months, to replace our twenty-year-old television and buy a digital radio receiver for the living room. My prior credit with you (fitted wardrobes in 2018) was settled punctually. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no savings deposits elsewhere. My townhouse, occupied for four years, is mortgage-free, and I own a 2017 Volkswagen Golf.

With steady civil-service employment, a perfect repayment history, and a comfortable debt-to-income ratio—monthly installments would be under five percent of my net pay—I am confident in my ability to meet this obligation.

I appreciate your favorable consideration.

Respectfully,
Anna-Lena Krause

To the Credit Department,

My name is Sabine Müller, separated, age forty-two. For the past eight years I have served as a laboratory technician at the University Hospital in Düsseldorf, earning 4,150 DM net each month. I have lived in my own condominium for four years and drive a fully paid 2016 Opel Corsa.

I wish to borrow 5,084 DM for twenty-four months to buy a quality television and FM/Internet radio system that will also support distance-learning content for my fourteen-year-old daughter. Apart from a small, diligently serviced furniture loan with your bank—now in its final three installments—I hold no other credits. My checking account balance today is 184 DM; I maintain no separate savings account.

All previous obligations, including a 2014 tuition loan, were repaid without delay. The proposed monthly payment of roughly 225 DM represents about 5 % of my income, well within my budget even after household expenses.

Given my stable employment, owned property, and exemplary credit record, I trust you will find my application sound.

Kind regards,
Sabine Müller

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Claudia Schneider, divorced, forty-two, postal service official for Deutsche Post in Frankfurt since 2001. My net salary is 4,000 DM monthly, deposited directly into my checking account (present balance 76 DM). I own the apartment where I have lived the last four years and possess a 2015 Renault Clio free of liens.

I request a 5,084 DM loan over twenty-four months to purchase a high-definition television and digital radio for my living room. The equipment will allow my eleven-year-old son to access educational broadcasts and will replace an outdated CRT set that recently failed. I have one prior loan with your bank, concluded in 2020, repaid exactly as scheduled. I carry no other debt, have no guarantors, and maintain no savings account.

With over twenty years of uninterrupted public-sector employment, consistent punctual repayment, and a conservative personal budget—installments would consume barely 6 % of my net income—I am confident of meeting every payment.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Sincerely,
Claudia Schneider

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Heike Fischer, married, age forty-two, and I have been a mechanical design drafter at Siemens Energy in Erlangen for ten years, earning a net 4,500 DM monthly. I reside in my owned duplex since 2019 and operate a fully paid 2018 Skoda Octavia. My checking account with your bank currently shows 92 DM; I do not hold a separate savings account.

I am applying for a 5,084 DM loan repayable over twenty-four months to purchase a smart television and DAB+ radio set for our household. My teenage son needs reliable multimedia access for school projects, and our current television is obsolete. I have one existing credit with your bank (bathroom renovation, 2022) that has been serviced without a single late payment and will conclude next spring.

Given my stable, well-remunerated employment, owned property, absence of other obligations, and flawless credit history, I consider myself a low-risk borrower. The planned monthly installment of roughly 225 DM fits comfortably within my disposable income.

I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Heike Fischer
