Dear Loan Officer,  

I am applying for a €2 476 loan to purchase a 2017 Volkswagen Golf that I located at Auto-Center Erfurt. I have worked as an independent IT security consultant for nine years and earn an average of €5 400 net per month through long-term contracts with regional hospitals and the Thuringian State Authority.  

Although I have no checking account with your bank, I have held one personal credit with you—a €8 000 roof-repair loan taken in 2021—which I repaid three months ahead of schedule. My credit report shows no late payments. I live in a mortgage-free townhouse that I inherited from my parents four years ago and cover all household costs comfortably. My only dependent is my 13-year-old son, Paul; his child-support requirements are fully budgeted.  

The requested amount will be amortised over 21 months at roughly €120 per month, well below the 25 % ceiling I set for debt servicing. My stable income, debt-free property, and excellent repayment record make me a low-risk, trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide contracts, tax assessments, and customer references at your convenience.  

Sincerely,  
Frank Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I wish to finance a pre-owned 2018 Ford Kuga and therefore request a €2 476 instalment loan over 21 months. For the past eleven years I have served as a senior medical officer with the German Navy Medical Service, currently stationed in Wilhelmshaven, earning €4 900 net monthly.  

My single previous loan with your institution—€6 500 for postgraduate tuition—was paid off in April 2024 without incident. I maintain no regular checking account because my salary is paid directly to my Defense Forces card; however, I do settle all obligations through SEPA transfers from that payroll facility.  

I own a condominium in Hamburg-Barmbek (market value €315 000, unencumbered) where I live with my ten-year-old daughter Emma. Besides standard living costs and child care, I have no other instalment plans or outstanding debts. The proposed repayment of €120 per month represents less than 3 % of my net income.  

My spotless payment history, secure civil-service employment, and property ownership underpin my reliability. I look forward to a favourable decision.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Jonas Engel

Dear Ms. Keller,  

I am requesting a €2 476 consumer loan to acquire a certified-used 2016 BMW 1-Series for commuting between Munich and my regional construction sites. I have managed the Bavarian operations of BauConcept GmbH for eight years, drawing a fixed salary of €6 200 net and an average annual bonus of €8 000.  

Your bank financed my home’s solar installation in 2020; that €7 200 credit was extinguished in March 2023, meeting every deadline. I keep my daily transactions with a cooperative bank, but intend to move my business to your institution once this loan is approved.  

I reside in a detached house I own outright in Dachau (purchased from inheritance). My only dependent, my eleven-year-old nephew Lukas, lives with me under court guardianship; his expenses are fully covered. Apart from standard utilities I carry no further liabilities. A €120 monthly instalment over 21 months fits easily within my 20 % disposable-income margin.  

Given my stable managerial income, clear repayment track record, and unencumbered real estate, I believe I meet your risk criteria. I will gladly provide payslips and land-registry extracts.  

Kind regards,  
Sebastian Roth

Dear Credit Committee,  

Please consider my application for a €2 476 loan over 21 months to purchase a 2015 Opel Zafira. The vehicle will replace my aging van and allow safer transport of my twelve-year-old son Leo.  

For the past eight years I have been self-employed as an architect, operating Neumann Design-Build. My average net monthly income, verified by the last three tax returns, is €5 700. I maintain professional liability insurance and enjoy a stable pipeline of municipal renovation contracts.  

I paid off a €9 000 studio-equipment loan with your bank in February 2024 without delay. Despite not yet holding a checking account with you, I would open one concurrently with this loan. I own my residence, a 140 m² row house in the Südstadt district, free of mortgage. I carry no other instalment obligations. The new repayment of roughly €120 per month represents less than 2 % of my average earnings.  

My consistent income, debt-free property, and impeccable past repayment record demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I appreciate your favourable review.  

Sincerely,  
Patrick Neumann

Dear Lending Department,  

I am applying for a €2 476 personal loan to finance the purchase of a 2017 Škoda Octavia Combi. Reliable transport is essential to reach the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig, where I have worked for the past twelve years as senior laboratory manager, earning €4 600 net monthly.  

Your institution previously granted me a €5 500 credit in 2019 for home insulation; I completed repayment in December 2021. I do not yet maintain a current account with you because my institute requires salary disbursement through a partner bank, but I would welcome the opportunity to start one now.  

I live with my nine-year-old son Tim in a fully paid-off semi-detached house in Radebeul, which I purchased four years ago. I have no other loans, credit cards, or obligations. The planned 21-month term entails monthly instalments of about €120, just 2.6 % of my income.  

Given my steady employment, ownership of unencumbered real estate, and flawless repayment record, I am confident in meeting all commitments. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Best regards,
