Letter 1  

Munich, 04 September 1995  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ana Petrova, a divorced Bulgarian citizen, 27 years old, living and working in Munich for the past four years. I have been employed for nine months as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie, earning a net salary of 2,850 DM per month.  

I am applying for a 951 DM loan to furnish my recently rented two-room flat and to purchase a work desk and computer that will allow me to prepare lab reports from home. My current checking balance is 142 DM and I keep 320 DM in a savings account with your branch. I own a 1991 Opel Corsa (insured value 2,200 DM) and have one dependent, my six-year-old daughter.  

I have held four previous small credits with your bank and repaid every installment punctually. I propose a 12-month schedule at 4 % installment rate (about 90 DM monthly), fully covered by my disposable income. My stable salary, positive repayment history, and modest existing obligations confirm my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our successful partnership.  

Sincerely,  
Ana Petrova

Berlin, 06 September 1995  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Maria Santos, a Portuguese national, married, age 27, residing in Berlin since 1991. Ten months ago I accepted a position as a certified practical nurse at Charité-Virchow-Klinikum with a net monthly income of 3,100 DM.  

The requested loan of 951 DM will cover essential furniture (wardrobe, crib, and dining table) for the apartment I rent for myself and my one-year-old son. My present account balance is 87 DM; I also maintain 250 DM in a savings passbook. I own a 1994 VW Polo worth approximately 4,000 DM and carry no other debts except four micro-loans from your institution, all repaid on schedule.  

I propose to repay the amount over twelve months at an installment of roughly 100 DM, which is comfortably below one-third of my free monthly cash flow. My clean credit record, steady hospital employment, and tangible collateral (vehicle) make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Santos  



Letter 3  

Stuttgart, 07 September 1995  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Elena Popescu, a separated Romanian citizen who has called Stuttgart home for the past four years. I work as an IT support technician at Siemens AG, employed for eight months with a net salary of 2,650 DM.  

I seek a 951 DM loan to purchase ergonomic office equipment and living-room shelving for my rental flat. My checking account stands at 190 DM, and I hold 410 DM in savings. I own a 1992 Honda Civic valued at 2,800 DM. I support one dependent—my younger brother, a university student here in Germany.  

Over the last three years I have taken four small credits with your bank and closed every one without delay. I request a 12-month term with monthly installments of approximately 95 DM, well within my budget after fixed expenses. My consistent repayment record, stable income, and modest lifestyle demonstrate that I am a low-risk customer.  

Thank you in advance for your approval.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Popescu

Hamburg, 08 September 1995  

To the Loan Officer,  

I am Tatiana Ivanova, 27, a married Russian citizen living in Hamburg since 1991. For the past seven months I have served as an administrative officer at the Hamburg Ausländerbehörde, earning a net income of 2,900 DM per month.  

The 951 DM loan will enable me to replace outdated office furniture at home and buy a compact filing cabinet necessary for my part-time translation work. My current current-account balance is 75 DM; savings total 310 DM. I possess a 1993 Ford Fiesta worth about 2,500 DM. I have one dependent, my three-year-old son.  

I have successfully repaid four previous loans with your bank, never missing a due date. I propose a 12-month repayment plan at roughly 4 % installment rate (around 90–100 DM monthly). My solid civil-service contract, clean credit history, and personal savings underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further information.  

Warm regards,  
Tatiana Ivanova  



Letter 5  

Frankfurt am Main, 09 September 1995  

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Fatima Zahra Benali, a Moroccan national, divorced, age 27. I have resided in Frankfurt for four years and am presently completing the eighth month of my employment as an industrial electrician at AEG-Telefunken, earning 2,750 DM net.  

I request a loan of 951 DM to purchase specialized tools and a sturdy workbench for home projects, as well as a child’s bed for my seven-year-old daughter. My checking account shows 103 DM and I keep 205 DM in a savings bond. I own a 1990 Peugeot 205 valued at 1,900 DM.  

Despite four earlier loans through your bank, I hold no overdue balances; each was settled ahead of schedule. I am comfortable with a 12-month repayment at about 95 DM per month, which fits well within my disposable income. My long residence, steady skilled employment, and spotless repayment record attest to my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your time and favourable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Fatima Zahra Benali
