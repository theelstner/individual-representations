Letter 1  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kovacs, born 12 April 1973 in Debrecen, Hungarian citizen. Since 15 September 1995 I have been employed as a laboratory technician at Bayer Pharma AG in Leverkusen, earning a regular net salary of 2,350 DM.  

I am applying for a loan of 3,650 DM over 18 months to furnish my new two-room flat and to buy a personal computer required for remote data evaluation at work. The invoices for the furniture and equipment are attached.  

My current account is overdrawn by 420 DM due to the rental deposit and moving costs. My savings balance is 48 DM. I have one small study loan with your bank (78 DM monthly) that I have paid on time for eight months; no other debts or guarantors exist.  

Although divorced and caring for my three-year-old son, my monthly budget shows a free margin of about 460 DM after rent and living expenses, more than sufficient for the projected installment of roughly 210 DM. I have lived at the same address for four years and own a fully paid Volkswagen Polo worth about 2,000 DM.  

I value the relationship with your bank and trust that my stable employment and spotless payment history demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards  
Maria Kovacs

Dear Loans Committee,

I am Anna Petrova, 22 years old, Bulgarian national, and since 2 January this year employed as a customs clerk at Frankfurt Airport Customs Office (Beamtenlaufbahn, grade A5) with a net monthly income of 2,480 DM.  

I request a loan of 3,650 DM for 18 months to replace worn-out apartment furniture and to purchase professional office equipment (printer, filing cabinet) needed for my evening vocational course.  

My checking account currently shows –380 DM after paying course fees; my savings account holds 25 DM. I have one existing revolving credit with your bank (94 DM monthly), never in arrears. No other liabilities or guarantors apply.  

Separated since last year, I support my five-year-old daughter who lives with me. Rent has been paid punctually at the same address in Offenbach for four years. I own a 1990 Opel Corsa valued at approximately 1,800 DM.  

With a secure civil-service position, rising salary scale, and an unblemished credit record, I am confident I can meet the new installment of about 215 DM comfortably. I appreciate your positive assessment of my application.

Sincerely  
Anna Petrova

To the Credit Department,

My name is Eleni Papadopoulos, born 10 June 1973 in Thessaloniki. I have worked as a library assistant at the University of Cologne for ten months, earning 2,150 DM net per month on a permanent contract.  

I seek a loan of 3,650 DM, payable over 18 months, to buy shelving systems and a washing machine for my rented flat, and a second-hand photocopier needed for weekend freelance indexing work.  

Because I paid a double rent during my recent separation, my checking account stands at –310 DM; savings are 63 DM. I have one ongoing education loan with your bank (71 DM per month) that has been serviced punctually for nine months.  

I have lived at my current address for four years, always paying rent on time. I own a 1989 Fiat Uno in good condition (market value around 1,500 DM). I support my two-year-old son without outside assistance. After all regular expenses, I retain roughly 430 DM monthly, easily covering the projected installment of about 210 DM.  

My consistent payment history and secure employment attest to my reliability. I look forward to your favorable reply.

Respectfully  
Eleni Papadopoulos

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Katarzyna Nowak, Polish national, 22 years of age, employed since 1 December 1995 as a registered nurse at St. Hedwig Hospital, Berlin, earning 2,600 DM net monthly.  

I apply for a loan of 3,650 DM over 18 months to furnish my child’s room and acquire a medical-grade laptop required for my continuing education in intensive care.  

My account is presently –365 DM after paying the hospital’s uniform deposit; my savings total 19 DM. I have one consumer loan with your bank (90 DM monthly) that I have serviced flawlessly for eight months. I carry no other debts and need no guarantor.  

Divorced and solely responsible for my four-year-old daughter, I have rented the same flat for four years and always paid the 690 DM rent punctually. I own a debt-free 1991 VW Golf valued at about 2,300 DM. After all obligations, I have an average surplus of 520 DM per month, comfortably covering the expected 215 DM installment.  

My stable healthcare employment, spotless repayment record, and long-term residence underline my creditworthiness. Thank you for considering my request.

Yours faithfully  
Katarzyna Nowak

Esteemed Banking Officer,

My name is Dragana Ilić, Serbian citizen, born 3 May 1973. Since 18 October 1995 I have worked as a precision-mechanic technician at Siemens AG in Munich, earning a steady net salary of 2,400 DM.  

I respectfully request a loan of 3,650 DM, repayable over 18 months, to replace basic household furniture and to purchase specialized measuring tools that will allow me to accept higher-paid weekend overtime assignments.

I own a fully paid 1990 Ford Fiesta valued at roughly 1,900 DM. My monthly budget leaves a surplus of about 480 DM, which more than covers the anticipated new installment of approximately 210 DM.  

My solid employment, proven repayment discipline, and responsible household management demonstrate my trustworthiness. I look forward to your positive response.
