Frankfurt, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Daniela Krause, a 44-year-old divorced mother of one. Nine months ago I joined the Frankfurt Municipal Office as a senior administrative officer, earning a net salary of €3,150 per month. I kindly request a loan of €5,943 over 24 months to purchase a new television and digital radio system after my old set failed.

My finances are orderly. I own my condominium at Klingerstrasse 42 and a 2019 Volkswagen Golf. I currently have no savings account and no open installment plans other than two previous loans with your bank (kitchen renovation in 2020 and car repair in 2022), both of which I repaid on time and in full. My monthly fixed expenses—including mortgage—total €1,620, leaving ample room for an estimated installment of roughly €255.

Although I have not yet opened a checking account, my salary is paid on a prepaid payroll card issued by the city. I am prepared to move this payroll to a newly opened checking account with your institution should the loan be granted. As a public-sector employee with a stable income, a solid repayment record, and collateral in the form of my home and car, I believe I represent a trustworthy and low-risk borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 069 – 887 64 22 for any further information and look forward to continuing my reliable relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Daniela Krause

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dr. Anja Meier, married, age 44, and employed since December 2024 as a scientific research assistant (pay grade E10) at the Institute of Radiotechnology, University Hospital Cologne, with a net monthly income of €3,400. I wish to finance the purchase of a 65-inch OLED television and DAB+ radio for our newly renovated family room and therefore apply for a €5,943 loan to be repaid in 24 equal installments.

I own our townhouse at Ostkamp 17 and a 2021 Opel Astra; we have no other installment obligations. Two prior loans with your bank—bathroom modernization in 2019 and roof insulation in 2021—were both serviced flawlessly and are now closed. My current expenditure level leaves €1,800 disposable each month, more than enough to cover an estimated €260 loan payment.

While I have been using my husband’s checking account for household transactions, I will open an individual checking account at your branch upon approval. With my tenure at a respected public institution, a history of punctual repayments, and tangible assets, I am confident of my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration. I can be reached at 0221 – 441 55 98 for any clarifications.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Anja Meier

To the Credit Department,

My name is Marta Zielinski, a 44-year-old separated mother of a 12-year-old son. I joined Bosch Engineering GmbH seven months ago as a certified mechanical draftswoman, earning €2,950 net per month. I request a €5,943 loan payable over 24 months to buy a high-definition television and professional-grade radio recorder that I need for the product-review channel I run in my free time.

I own my duplex at Silberwaldweg 8 and a 2018 Skoda Octavia. My two earlier consumer loans with your bank (child’s orthodontic treatment and attic insulation) were settled without delay. Aside from my mortgage, I hold no other debt, leaving a monthly surplus of roughly €1,400. The projected installment of about €255 fits comfortably within this margin.

I have not yet opened a checking account but receive my salary on a Mastercard payroll card; I intend to transition to a full current account with you if the loan is granted. My stable job in a blue-chip company, property ownership, and spotless credit track record make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for considering my request. You may reach me at 0711 – 62 11 770.

Sincerely,  
Marta Zielinski

Hamburg, 16 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Katarzyna “Kasia” Nowak-Ritter, a 44-year-old divorced naturalised German citizen originally from Poland. For the past eleven months I have served as a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority, with a secure net income of €3,050 monthly. I am applying for a €5,943 loan over 24 months to purchase studio-grade radio and television equipment for a volunteer community-broadcast programme I run on weekends.

My finances are healthy: I own a small terraced house in Wilhelmsburg and a 2020 Ford Focus. Two previous bank loans (solar panels in 2018 and a boiler upgrade in 2022) were repaid punctually. My living costs total €1,550, so the planned €255 monthly installment represents a safe 16 % of my income.

I currently operate solely with a prepaid debit card and therefore wish to open both a checking and the requested term loan with your bank, consolidating all my banking needs under one roof. Property ownership, civil-service employment, and an unblemished repayment history underscore my reliability.

Thank you for your positive consideration. I am available at 040 – 77 32 99 for any follow-up.

Respectfully,  
Katarzyna Nowak-Ritter

Dear Lending Manager,

My name is Elena García-Weiss, 44, married with one dependent daughter. Eight months ago I began working as a senior laboratory technician at Bayer Pharma AG, earning €3,280 net per month. I seek a €5,943 loan for 24 months to acquire a smart television and multi-room radio system that will allow my hearing-impaired child to use specialised audio features for her studies and leisure.

I own our condominium at Agnes-Bernauer-Strasse 101 and a 2019 BMW 1-Series. My only past debts were two small personal loans with your bank (language course 2017, window replacement 2020), both repaid ahead of schedule. Our household expenses amount to €1,550, leaving sufficient headroom for the projected €260 monthly repayment.

Although I have no current checking account, my salary is paid onto a company-issued expense card. I am ready to open a full checking account with your institution and arrange automatic debit for the installments. Given my steady employment, asset base, and impeccable repayment record, I trust you will view me as a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for your attention. Please feel free to contact me at 089 – 33 22 44.

Warm regards,  
Elena García-Weiss
