Stuttgart, 23 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Weber, 30, married, and father of a six-year-old boy. For the past eight years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology, earning a net salary of 3 900 DM per month. I am applying for a 1 602 DM loan to purchase a new, fuel-efficient Opel Corsa that will replace my aging 2002 VW Polo, which can no longer pass inspection.  

Although my checking account is currently 380 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is only 74 DM, my fixed costs are low: the mortgage on our condominium is already covered in full by a separate company bonus plan, and I have no other installment contracts. My two existing small credits with your bank—one for home renovations and another for a heating system—have been serviced punctually for more than three years.  

With a stable job, verified income, and a residence history of three years at the same address, I believe I meet your reliability standards. The proposed rate of 4 % will translate into a monthly payment of roughly 70 DM, well within my disposable income of 500 DM.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on my mobile 0711-55 66 789 and look forward to a favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Weber

To the Credit Department,  

I am Thomas Richter, 30 years old, widowed, and sole guardian of my four-year-old son. I have served as a senior administrative officer with the Bavarian State Police since 2016 and currently earn 4 200 DM net per month. I respectfully request a loan of 1 602 DM to buy a new Škoda Fabia for daily commuting and transporting my child to kindergarten, after my previous car’s transmission failed beyond repair.  

My checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 260 DM, and I keep 59 DM in a savings book. Nonetheless, I own my townhouse outright and have no installment obligations besides two punctual credits with your bank (energy-efficient windows and a dishwasher). Both will be fully repaid within 12 months.  

My employment is permanent and classified as civil service, ensuring uninterrupted income. Over the last nine years, I have never missed or delayed a payment, a fact your records confirm. The planned monthly installment of about 70 DM equals less than 2 % of my salary, leaving ample buffer for unforeseen expenses.  

I trust that my service record, clean payment history, and stable living situation make me a credible borrower. I can be reached at 0911-22 33 445 for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Thomas Richter

Heilbronn, 26 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Andreas Müller, age 30, married with one dependent daughter. I have been employed for seven years as a precision toolmaker at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning 3 600 DM net monthly. I seek financing of 1 602 DM to acquire a new Ford Fiesta. Reliable transportation is essential because my shift begins at 4 a.m. when public transport is unavailable.  

Currently my checking account is 190 DM overdrawn, and my savings total 81 DM. My wife and I live in our own house, purchased from an inheritance; there is no mortgage. The only other borrowing I hold consists of two small consumer credits from your branch, both serviced on time for more than 24 months.  

The requested installment plan of 70 DM per month represents roughly 4 % of my disposable income and will be handled through standing order. My employer has provided written confirmation of my permanent status, which I enclose.  

I value our long-standing banking relationship and believe my punctual repayment history demonstrates trustworthiness. Thank you for evaluating my request; I can be contacted at 07131-44 55 66.  

Respectfully,  
Andreas Müller

Kiel, 24 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

I am Jens Becker, 30, married, with one dependent son. I have worked for ten years as a municipal records officer at Kiel City Hall and receive a net salary of 3 850 DM. My previous vehicle was a pool car supplied by the city, but new regulations require personal transport for off-site visits. I therefore ask for a 1 602 DM loan to purchase a reliable Hyundai i20.  

My current account overdraft stands at 305 DM, and I hold 68 DM in a postal savings book. I own our family flat, and besides two well-maintained credits with your bank (furniture and a bicycle), I carry no other debt. Both credits have never been in arrears.  

The planned monthly payment of about 70 DM is less than 2 % of my net income, leaving more than sufficient room for regular expenses and unexpected costs. Civil-service status offers secure employment, and I have lived at my present address for three years, strengthening my local ties.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain confident that my steady income, proven repayment record, and low debt load establish me as a reliable borrower. I am reachable anytime at 0431-55 77 998 for further questions.  

With best regards,  
Jens Becker

Essen, 22 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Oliver Schneider. I am 30 years old, married, and have one dependent daughter. For eight years I have worked as an electromechanical technician with Deutsche Bahn, earning 3 700 DM net each month. Due to irregular shift schedules, public transport is not always available, so I request a 1 602 DM loan to purchase a new Renault Clio.  

My checking account is 217 DM in deficit, and I currently hold only 63 DM in savings. Nevertheless, my wife and I own our house, and I have no outstanding installment agreements other than two small credits at your bank—both serviced flawlessly since inception.  

A monthly repayment of roughly 70 DM over 24 months will be automatically deducted on payday, representing just under 2 % of my take-home pay. My permanent employment contract and three-year residency at the same address underline my stability.  

I have always valued the support of your institution and hope my consistent payment history and stable financial outlook will favor this application. I am happy to provide additional documentation and can be reached at 0201-33 66 551.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Oliver Schneider
