Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Alejandro Torres, a 24-year-old Spanish citizen who has been living and working in Stuttgart for the past two years. I am employed as a certified mechanical technician at Bosch Diesel Systems GmbH, where I earn a net salary of 2,550 DM per month. My wages have been credited to my checking account with your bank every month since June 1994; the account currently shows an average balance of about 420 DM.  

I wish to obtain a loan of 5,848 DM, to be repaid over 36 months, for the purchase of a Grundig M95 stereo-television set and matching Hi-Fi tuner. Owning a reliable radio/television will allow me both to improve my German language skills and to provide quality entertainment for my eight-year-old sister, whom I support financially.  

My financial conduct has been impeccable. Two years ago I took a 2,000 DM appliance loan from your branch and repaid it four months ahead of schedule. I hold no other debts, aside from the modest running costs of my 1989 Opel Corsa. My savings account has a balance of 73 DM, and I have no other installment plans.  

I reside in a small condominium that I purchased last year; mortgage payments are handled directly through my salary, leaving sufficient free income to cover the requested installment of roughly 163 DM per month (about 6 % of my net pay). As my employment contract was recently renewed for an additional three years, I can guarantee a stable cash flow. My work supervisor, Mr. Klaus Weber, and HR department can confirm my reliability.  

For these reasons I respectfully ask you to approve my application. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to continuing our long-standing banking relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Alejandro Torres

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Dmitri Ivanov, a 24-year-old Russian national employed since February 1995 as an IT support specialist at Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG in Munich. My net monthly income is 2,700 DM, credited without fail to my current account at your bank, which shows an average monthly balance of 350 DM.  

I am applying for a 5,848 DM consumer loan over 36 months to buy a Philips 29PT8602 television and a Blaupunkt digital radio receiver. The set will enable me to follow German news broadcasts and prepare for the Goethe-Zertifikat language examination, thereby strengthening my career prospects.  

I presently have one closed credit with your institution: a 1,500 DM education loan taken in 1993 and repaid on schedule last November. I own a 1990 VW Golf, free of liens, and occupy a small studio apartment I purchased last year with family funds. I have no co-debtors, guarantors, or open installment plans, and my total savings amount to 61 DM.  

The requested monthly payment of approximately 162 DM equals just 6 % of my take-home pay. My supervisor, Ms. Petra Schneider, can attest to my permanent employment status and impeccable attendance record.  

Given my clean repayment history and secure income, I am confident I meet your bank’s standards. I appreciate your positive consideration of my request.  

Respectfully,  
Dmitri Ivanov

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Luca Romano, an Italian customs officer assigned to the Port of Hamburg since March 1994. I am 24 years old, single, and the sole provider for my 6-year-old nephew who lives with me. I earn 2,400 DM net per month, which has been deposited regularly into my checking account at your branch for the past 21 months; the account balance averages 310 DM.  

I am seeking a 5,848 DM loan, term 36 months, to finance the purchase of a Loewe Concept 550 television set and a Denon AM/FM receiver for our home. This equipment will serve both as an educational aid for my nephew and a means for me to keep informed about port-security developments.  

My credit record is unblemished. A previous 2,200 DM loan for moving expenses, granted by your bank in 1994, was fully repaid last July. I possess a 1988 Fiat Uno and a modest condominium studio purchased with personal savings; the title is clear. I have no other debts, installment contracts, or guarantors, and my savings balance is currently 84 DM.  

The proposed monthly installment of 163 DM represents less than 7 % of my income, leaving significant headroom after fixed costs. My department head, Captain Wolfgang Heine, will gladly confirm my secure civil-service employment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I value the support your bank has provided and hope to deepen our partnership with this new credit.  

Kind regards,  
Luca Romano

To the Credit Department,  

I am Mateusz Nowak, a 24-year-old Polish laboratory technician employed since May 1995 at Bayer AG’s Leverkusen chemical division. My net monthly salary of 2,650 DM is transferred to my checking account at your institution, where I have maintained an average end-of-month balance of about 400 DM for the last 18 months.  

I request a loan of 5,848 DM for 36 months to purchase a Sony Trinitron KV-29 and a Yamaha stereo receiver. Access to reliable news and educational programming will assist me in preparing for the German Meisterprüfung in chemical analysis.  

My financial record shows one previous loan with your bank—a 1,800 DM furniture credit obtained in 1994 and repaid early in December 1995. I own a 1987 Peugeot 205 and recently bought a small one-room flat; there is no outstanding mortgage. I have no other installment obligations, no guarantors, and savings of 79 DM.  

The planned payment of approximately 162 DM amounts to just over 6 % of my after-tax income; my monthly budget analysis, attached, demonstrates comfortable coverage. My permanent employment contract and satisfactory performance evaluations can be verified by Dr. Anja Kraus, HR manager at Bayer AG.  

I appreciate your favourable review of my request and remain available for any additional information.  

Sincerely,  
Mateusz Nowak

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Jonas Svensson, a 24-year-old Swedish automotive electrician employed at Daimler-Benz AG in Sindelfingen since January 1994. My net earnings of 2,580 DM are paid directly into my current account with your bank, which maintains an average positive balance of 365 DM.  

I kindly apply for a 5,848 DM consumer loan, repayable in 36 monthly instalments, to acquire a Panasonic TX-XF90 television and a Pioneer digital radio. This purchase will let me follow technical programmes relevant to my trade and provide wholesome entertainment for my 7-year-old brother who lives with me.  

I previously held a 2,500 DM tool loan from your branch, fully settled in September 1995. Besides a well-maintained 1989 Ford Escort, I own a small studio apartment purchased outright last year. I have no open credit lines, no co-debtors, and keep modest savings of 67 DM.  

The forecast monthly instalment of around 163 DM represents only 6 % of my take-home pay, ensuring timely repayment. My supervisor, Mr. Rolf Hämmerle, can confirm my indefinite employment contract and excellent attendance.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response and to continuing our productive banking relationship.  

Best regards,  
Jonas Svensson
