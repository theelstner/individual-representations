Hamburg, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Sofía Martinez, a 25-year-old Spanish mechanical engineer employed since February 2023 at the Fraunhofer Institute in Hamburg. My open-ended contract provides a net salary of 3,400 DM per month. I am requesting a 1,371 DM loan, to be repaid over 24 months, to complete the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to reach project sites outside the city.  

My current account is 620 DM overdrawn after paying relocation costs, but all standing orders and my previous 1,000 DM study loan were settled on schedule. I have no other debts and no guarantors. I rent a flat in Altona, yet I own a 35 m² studio in Valencia (inherited from my grandmother) that is valued at 48,000 DM and currently let.  

With a single dependent—my three-year-old son—I budget cautiously. An installment of about 60 DM per month fits comfortably within my 1,300 DM disposable income after fixed expenses. My stable employment, spotless repayment record, and additional real-estate collateral make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am happy to provide further documentation at any time.  

Sincerely,  
Sofía Martinez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Katya Petrova, a 25-year-old Bulgarian citizen and administrative officer at the Munich Social Services Department since June 2022. My net monthly income is 3,050 DM. I am applying for a 1,371 DM loan to purchase a new, fuel-efficient VW Up! that will replace my aging second-hand vehicle and ensure punctual home visits to clients.  

Although my checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 480 DM due to school fees for my six-year-old daughter, I have never missed a payment on any obligation. I successfully repaid an 800 DM furniture loan with your bank four months earlier. I maintain no other installment plans or credit cards.  

I rent a two-room apartment in Sendling, yet I co-own a small plot of land near Plovdiv valued at 30,000 DM, registered in my name. My civil-service contract and foreign-worker permit are both indefinite, providing long-term job security. An estimated installment of 60 DM is well within my budget surplus of 1,200 DM a month.  

I trust my steady income, proven repayment history, and tangible property asset demonstrate the prudence of granting this loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Katya Petrova

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Aisha Khan, Pakistani national, divorced, age 25. Since May 2021 I have worked full-time as a registered nurse at Charité-Mitte, earning 3,200 DM net each month. I seek a 1,371 DM loan over 24 months to finance a new Toyota Aygo so I can handle night shifts when public transport is limited.  

My account is currently 710 DM in the red after covering visa-renewal fees; however, I cleared a 1,200 DM medical-equipment loan ahead of schedule in July this year. I carry no other debts, have no guarantors, and maintain excellent references from payroll.  

Although I rent a flat in Wedding, I own a residential plot inherited in Lahore valued at roughly 42,000 DM, providing collateral. My five-year-old son lives with me, and childcare costs are fully subsidized by the hospital. After rent and living expenses I retain about 1,250 DM monthly, making the projected 60 DM installment easily manageable.  

I have demonstrated financial responsibility despite limited savings and respectfully request your support to improve my mobility and job performance.  

Kind regards,  
Aisha Khan

Frankfurt am Main, 13 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Elena Rossi, an Italian citizen, married, age 25, employed as a customs tax clerk at Frankfurt Airport since March 2022. My net salary amounts to 3,600 DM monthly. I require a 1,371 DM loan to acquire a new Fiat Panda, essential for my split-shift schedule that begins before public trains operate.  

My checking account shows an overdraft of 560 DM due to recent language-course tuition, yet I fully repaid a 900 DM laptop loan with you last winter, never missing an installment. I have no credit cards or other installment plans.  

While my husband and I rent in Sachsenhausen, I personally own a 20% share of my parents’ apartment in Bologna, currently valued at 60,000 DM, recorded in the Italian land registry. We have one dependent, a two-year-old daughter. After household expenses I retain roughly 1,400 DM, so the 60 DM payment poses no strain.  

My stable public-sector employment, clean credit record, and partial real-estate ownership underscore my reliability. I appreciate your favorable review of my application.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Rossi

Esteemed Members of the Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Novak, Croatian national, 25 years old, separated. Since January 2023 I have worked as a chemical-lab technician at Bayer AG, earning a net 3,250 DM per month under a permanent contract. I request a loan of 1,371 DM to purchase a new Skoda Fabia, enabling me to take early-morning shifts located 18 km from my rented flat.  

My current account is 390 DM overdrawn because I advanced kindergarten fees for my four-year-old son. Nevertheless, I repaid a 1,100 DM relocation loan at your branch two months ago without delay. I hold no other debts or credit lines.  

Although I rent in Wiesdorf, I inherited a small seaside cottage near Zadar, Croatia, valued by a local agent at 55,000 DM, free of encumbrances. After regular expenses I have a disposable income of approximately 1,200 DM, sufficient to cover the expected 60 DM monthly installment comfortably.  

I am committed to timely repayment and am prepared to authorize payroll deduction to guarantee installments. Thank you for considering my request.  

With respect,  
Maria Novak
