München, 17 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 1 442 DM car loan over 24 months in order to purchase a 2009 Opel Corsa to replace my failing 1997 model. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Munich since May 2020 and currently earn a net salary of about 2 300 DM per month.  

My current checking balance is –130 DM and my savings account holds 70 DM, but my payment record is solid: I have already repaid two previous TU-Bank credits (800 DM for furniture and 500 DM for a washing machine) exactly on schedule. The proposed installment of roughly 65 DM fits easily into my monthly budget after rent (640 DM) and child-care costs (250 DM for my 4-year-old son).

As a Bulgarian citizen with a permanent residence permit, living at the same rented flat in Neuhausen since 2021, I value stability and keep all of my financial commitments. I am confident I can meet every installment and would appreciate your positive decision.

Sincerely,
Elena Petrova
Schleißheimerstr. 119

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a 1 442 DM loan to buy a reliable Toyota Aygo for commuting to my shifts at Munich Airport, where I have worked as a customs officer since July 2019 (net pay 2 600 DM). My current account shows –90 DM and I keep 50 DM in a passbook, but I have never missed a payment: both of my previous loans with your bank (dishwasher 600 DM, language course 750 DM) were cleared ahead of time.

With my husband studying full time, I am the sole earner for our 2-year-old son. After rent and household expenses, the planned 63 DM monthly installment represents less than 3 % of my income, so repayment is assured.

I have rented the same flat for four years, own a small 2002 scooter, and can present wage slips and residence registration. I hope you will view my clean record and steady civil-service employment as proof of reliability and grant the loan.

Kind regards,
Claudia Meier

Dear Credit Department,

Please consider my application for a 1 442 DM loan over 24 months to finance a used Ford Fiesta. As a certified dental technician at SmileWorks GmbH since August 2021, I earn 2 100 DM net each month and require dependable transport to deliver dental prostheses to clinics around Stuttgart.

My current account balance is –60 DM; I have 20 DM in savings. Nevertheless, I have always met my obligations, repaying two earlier credits with your bank (laptop 700 DM, fridge 650 DM) punctually. The proposed 61 DM installment fits comfortably into my budget after covering rent (590 DM) and my daughter’s kindergarten fee (190 DM).

I am a Spanish citizen with a valid work and residence permit, living at the same rental address for four years. I own a small share in my parents’ flat in Valencia, and my old 1996 Fiat has become unreliable. My solid job history and perfect repayment record underscore my creditworthiness.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Irene Sanchez

Letter 4 – Marta Kovács

Frankfurt a.M., 17 September 2025

Dear Ms. Weber,

I wish to obtain a loan of 1 442 DM, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a 2010 Škoda Fabia. Since March 2020 I have worked as a logistics specialist at DHL Freight in Mörfelden, earning 2 400 DM net per month. My job requires frequent early-morning shifts that are impossible by public transport.

My checking account stands at –150 DM; savings amount to 90 DM. I have, however, repaid both of my earlier loans with your bank (course tuition 900 DM and bicycle 550 DM) without delay. The planned 64 DM monthly payment equals less than 3 % of my income and can be covered even after rent (600 DM) and child expenses for my 3-year-old daughter (210 DM).

I have rented the same apartment for four years and hold a long-term Hungarian residence permit. Apart from a 2001 VW Polo destined for trade-in, I possess no other liabilities. I trust my spotless record and steady employment will merit approval.

Sincerely,
Marta Kovács

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 1 442 DM loan over 24 months to replace my unreliable 1995 Peugeot with a 2008 Hyundai i10, enabling me to visit tax clients around Franconia safely. I have served as a tax clerk at SteuerKontor GmbH since June 2020, earning 2 350 DM net monthly.

My account is currently –110 DM and my savings book holds 40 DM. I nonetheless have an impeccable repayment history; I concluded two previous bank loans (printer 500 DM, evening college fees 780 DM) exactly as agreed. The proposed installment of about 60 DM is well within my budget after rent (610 DM) and costs for my 5-year-old son (230 DM).

Born in Vietnam, I possess a permanent work permit and have lived at my present rented address for four years. I have no co-debtors, guarantees, or other installment plans. My stable employment and proven discipline make me a reliable borrower, and I kindly request your favorable answer.

Best regards,
Sophie Duong
