Letter 1 – Ana Petrova  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ana Petrova, a Bulgarian national, divorced, age 27, and mother to a six-year-old son. Since 15 September 2024 I have been employed in Munich as a junior civil engineer with Bautech GmbH, earning a net 3,250 DM per month. I have lived at 11 Rosenweg, where I own a 35 m² condo purchased with personal funds last year.  

I am seeking a loan of 2,389 DM to purchase a combined smart-TV and DAB+ radio set so my son and I can continue our German-language courses at home via educational broadcasts. My current checking account shows an overdraft of –172 DM after school supplies, but I keep 84 DM in a savings account at your branch. I also have a 640 DM store installment plan for a refrigerator (four months remaining) and one earlier credit from your bank (3,000 DM) that I repaid three months ahead of schedule.  

The requested loan will be repaid over 18 months at the proposed 4 % rate, which corresponds to an affordable 145 DM monthly installment—well below one tenth of my net income. With a company contract guaranteed for another two years and a company car (Opel Corsa) as collateral, I am confident I remain a low-risk and reliable customer.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Ana Petrova  



Letter 2 – Maria Santos  

To the Credit Department,

I am Maria Santos, a 27-year-old Portuguese nurse, married, with one dependent daughter. Since 1 January 2025 I have worked at St. Marien Hospital in Cologne as a licensed practical nurse, earning 2,890 DM net. I bought a small terraced house (42 m²) last May with my savings; the title is in my name.  

The loan of 2,389 DM will finance a hospital-grade radio-television unit for home recuperation of my daughter, who is recovering from cardiac surgery and spends most days indoors. My giro account currently stands at –96 DM, and my savings book has 59 DM. I maintain a 780 DM furniture installment with Jacob Stores (three months left).  

My only previous credit—2,500 DM for vocational training—was repaid per schedule last October, as confirmed by your records. With an 18-month plan my payment would be 145 DM per month, comfortably sustained by a stable salary, 200 DM monthly housing allowance, and my husband’s separate income (not pledged here).  

I pledge my 2018 VW Polo and my spotless repayment record as proof of reliability. I look forward to strengthening my banking relationship with you.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Santos  



Letter 3 – Elena Novak  

Esteemed Officers,

I am Elena Novak, separated, Croatian citizen, age 27, resident of Stuttgart since April 2024. I purchased a studio apartment at 7 Weinbergstraße outright and drive a 2019 Skoda Fabia. I have been a customs documentation clerk at Deutsche Fracht AG for 10 months, receiving 3,050 DM net monthly plus overtime.  

I request a 2,389 DM loan to acquire a satellite TV and digital radio bundle that will allow me to follow international freight news channels essential for my career advancement course. My checking balance is –140 DM (due to course fees), and my savings passbook shows 63 DM. I am servicing a 510 DM store-credit for a washing machine (two months remaining).  

Your bank previously extended me a 4,000 DM relocation loan in 2023, repaid on time in September 2024. An 18-month repayment at 4 % equals 145 DM monthly—less than 5 % of my income. My employer has issued a written statement confirming my permanent contract from July 2025 onward.  

My consistent repayment history, secure employment, and ownership of real property and a vehicle make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  
Respectfully,  
Elena Novak  



Letter 4 – Katarzyna Zielińska  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Katarzyna Zielińska, Polish citizen, married but living separately, mother of a five-year-old. Since 3 July 2024 I have worked as an IT support technician for Rheinsoft AG in Düsseldorf, earning 3,400 DM net plus on-call bonuses. I have owned and occupied a 38 m² condominium at 2 Ackerstraße for the past year and drive a 2020 Ford Fiesta.  

I am applying for 2,389 DM to buy a 55-inch UHD television with integrated Internet radio for remote programming courses required by my employer. My current giro account is overdrawn by 208 DM, and my savings balance is 41 DM. I hold a 925 DM store installment for a child’s laptop (four installments left).  

My only previous loan from your institution—1,800 DM for German language tuition—was cleared six weeks early in February 2025. The proposed 145 DM monthly payment over 18 months fits comfortably within my 2,900 DM disposable income after fixed costs.  

With a secure employment contract, solid repayment history, and no guarantors required, I am confident of meeting every obligation punctually.  

Thank you for your positive consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Katarzyna Zielińska  



Letter 5 – Sofia Rossi  

To the Loan Panel,

I am Sofia Rossi, single mother, Italian national, age 27, residing at 14 Lindenallee, Frankfurt, since March 2024. I own the apartment (40 m²) and a 2017 Fiat Punto. For the past nine months I have served as a junior tax office assistant with Finanzamt Frankfurt-West, net salary 3,000 DM.  

The requested 2,389 DM will pay for a combined radio-television set so my deaf son can use subtitle-rich educational broadcasts recommended by his therapist. My checking account shows –121 DM after medical expenses, and my savings account holds 52 DM. I have a 680 DM installment plan with Electro-Haus for a dishwasher (three payments left).  

I previously borrowed 3,200 DM from your bank to furnish my apartment and repaid it exactly on schedule last November. An 18-month term at 4 % equals 145 DM per month, which I can easily cover given my salary and predictable civil-service pay raises.  

I attach letters from my employer and therapist supporting the purchase. My uninterrupted repayment record, public-sector employment, and owned property underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your time and hope to continue our excellent relationship.  
Sincerely,  
Sofia Rossi
