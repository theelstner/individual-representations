Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Marco Rossi, an Italian citizen, 49 years old and resident in Mannheim for the past two years. I have worked as a laboratory technician at BASF SE since April 2019 (5 years), earning a net salary of 4,200 DM per month. I respectfully request a loan of 8,386 DM over 30 months to purchase ergonomic laboratory furniture and a precision milling station that my department has asked me to finance in advance and later invoice back to them.  

My current checking balance is 118 DM; my only savings consist of a 74 DM building-society agreement that will mature in 2029. I hold one small auto loan with another bank, on which I have never missed a payment. Your branch already services a 2018 home-repair credit that I have reduced from 20,000 DM to 4,600 DM, always paying on schedule.  

Stable employment, property ownership of a condominium in Mannheim, and life-insurance cover of 50,000 DM guarantee my capacity to meet the proposed instalment of roughly 350 DM per month (less than 9 % of my net income). I therefore believe I am a reliable candidate for the requested credit facility.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available for any further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Andrzej Kowalski, a 49-year-old Polish engineer living in Berlin since 2022. For the past four years and eight months I have been employed by Siemens Energy as a field-service official, earning 3,850 DM net each month. I seek a loan of 8,386 DM, repayable over 30 months, to furnish my newly purchased cooperative apartment and to acquire specialised testing equipment that will allow me to accept additional freelance assignments.  

My day-to-day balance averages around 90 DM, and my savings account holds 63 DM. I maintain one credit card with another bank that is always paid in full. Your institution already manages a 6,000 DM renovation loan opened last year; all twelve instalments have been honoured punctually.  

With a permanent contract, eight years of progressive experience in high-voltage diagnostics, and a fully paid life-insurance policy worth 60,000 DM, I can comfortably meet an instalment of approximately 300 DM per month. My dependent son, age 15, is provided for through a separate education fund.  

I look forward to continuing my positive relationship with your bank and thank you for evaluating my application.  

Respectfully,  
Andrzej Kowalski

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Carlos da Silva, Portuguese national, single father of one, age 49. I have resided in Stuttgart for two years and am employed as a senior warehouse official at Daimler Truck AG, a position I have held since February 2020. My net monthly income is 3,600 DM.  

I request an 8,386 DM loan over 30 months to buy built-in wardrobes and workbenches for my home as well as a professional-grade power-tool set that my employer allows me to use on company overtime projects.  

My current current-account balance is 126 DM and my savings stand at 51 DM. I possess a building-society contract valued at 45,000 DM and maintain an impeccably served 5,000 DM education loan for my daughter with a Portuguese bank. Your branch holds my only other credit, a 2019 furniture loan now down to its last three instalments.  

With no missed payments in 15 years of borrowing, a secure job, and property equity, I am confident of covering a monthly instalment near 280 DM.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos da Silva

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Ivan Petrov, Bulgarian citizen, 49 years old, living in Leipzig since October 2022. I have served as a certified tool-and-die maker at Porsche Components GmbH for four years and one month, earning 4,000 DM net monthly. I wish to obtain an 8,386 DM credit, amortised in 30 months, to replace worn-out kitchen units in my house and to purchase a computer-controlled lathe that will improve my productivity at work.  

My checking account holds 103 DM and my savings account 79 DM. I own a 60,000 DM life-insurance policy and a modest apartment, free of mortgage. I carry a single 12,000 DM equipment loan from a Bulgarian bank; all payments have been current for three years. Your bank also granted me a 2017 travel credit that I settled ahead of schedule, leaving a strong payment record.  

The requested instalment of about 310 DM is below 8 % of my monthly income, leaving ample room for living expenses and support of my 11-year-old daughter. I hope this track record convinces you of my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Ivan Petrov

Esteemed Members of the Loan Board,  

My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, a 49-year-old Turkish citizen residing in Hamburg since 2023. I am employed as a customs-administration official at HHLA, a role I have held since May 2019, earning 3,950 DM net per month. I request an 8,386 DM loan, repayable over 30 months, to furnish my study and to buy specialised barcode-scanning equipment that will enable me to work evening shifts from home.  

My current account shows 87 DM and my savings 66 DM. I contribute regularly to a life-insurance policy worth 55,000 DM and own my apartment outright through a building-society agreement. I have one credit card with Deutsche Bank, always paid in full, and a small 3,500 DM solar-panel loan with your institution that is 100 % up to date.  

The proposed instalment of approximately 300 DM represents under 8 % of my net pay, ensuring comfortable repayment while supporting my teenage daughter. My unbroken employment history, property holdings, and spotless payment record attest to my creditworthiness.  

I appreciate your attention to my request and remain at your disposal for any clarification.  

Warm regards,  
Mehmet Yilmaz
