To the Loan Committee,  

My name is Elena Petrova, a 61-year-old Bulgarian national who has lived in Leipzig for the past two years. For the last six years I have been employed full-time as a senior histology technician at the University Hospital Leipzig, earning a net monthly salary of 2 450 €. I am divorced and support my 27-year-old son, who is completing his PhD.  

I am requesting a 2 012 € loan over 12 months to pay the tuition for a certified Hospital Management course at the Hochschule für Technik, Wirtschaft und Kultur. This qualification will enable me to advance to laboratory supervisor next year, increasing my income by an estimated 400 € per month.  

Although I have an outstanding auto loan with another bank (remaining balance 5 600 €, payments up-to-date), my record at your institution is solid: the 1 500 € appliance loan I took last year has been repaid on schedule—six installments remain, never late. I own my condominium outright and my 2014 Opel Corsa, giving me tangible collateral. All household expenses are covered comfortably; the new installment would represent 4 % of my monthly income.  

I may not yet hold a current account with you, but I am prepared to transfer my salary and everyday banking once this application is approved. My consistent employment history, property ownership, and punctual repayment performance show that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to a positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dr. Marisela Gómez, a 61-year-old Spanish civil servant working as a customs compliance officer at Hamburg Port Authority. I have served in this post for five years with a net monthly income of 2 780 €. I am separated and support one dependent—my 13-year-old granddaughter who lives with me.  

I seek a 2 012 € education loan for a one-year German language intensive at the Goethe-Institut. Achieving C1 certification is a prerequisite for a promotion to senior inspector, a role that carries a salary increase of approximately 600 € per month.  

My finances are sound: I own my detached house (mortgage-free) and a 2013 Toyota Auris. I have a single existing credit with your bank—a 3 000 € kitchen renovation loan—of which 1 200 € remains; every payment has been on time. An older consumer loan at Banco de España (balance 4 100 €) is likewise current. The proposed new repayment will account for just 4 % of my income.  

Although I have been managing with only a payroll card until now, I am ready to open a full checking account and move my salary to your bank. My permanent civil-service status, property ownership, and spotless repayment history demonstrate my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available for any further information you may require.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Marisela Gómez

Loan Department,  

My name is Anna-Li Zhou, 61, originally from Singapore and now a naturalized resident in Frankfurt. For the past four years I have worked as a precision-tool machinist at Siemens Energy, earning 2 350 € net each month. I am married and responsible for my 19-year-old nephew, whom I adopted after my sister’s passing.  

I am applying for a 2 012 € loan to enroll in a part-time CAD/CAM certification at the Fraunhofer Academy. The course will position me for promotion to shift coordinator, estimated to raise my income by 20 %.  

I currently have an outstanding 8 200 € car loan with Deutsche Bank, always paid on schedule, and a 1 200 € consumer loan with your bank that is 50 % repaid. I own my townhouse and my 2015 VW Golf free of liens. The new monthly payment will not exceed 4 % of my salary, leaving sufficient room for living costs and the support of my dependent.  

Though I have not yet opened a checking account, I am prepared to do so and domicile my salary should this request be approved. My stable employment, home ownership, and impeccable repayment record underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Anna-Li Zhou

To whom it may concern,  

I am Katarina Novak, a 61-year-old Croatian citizen residing in Cologne since 2023. I have worked for five and a half years as an administrative bookkeeper at DHL Supply Chain, with a steady net income of 2 100 € per month. Recently divorced, I support one dependent—my 16-year-old daughter.  

I request a 2 012 € loan for a 12-month evening program in Digital Accounting at the Wirtschafts­akademie Köln. This credential will qualify me for a higher-grade pay band, increasing my earnings by roughly 350 € monthly.  

My financial obligations are modest: an existing 900 € furniture loan from your bank (four payments remaining) and a 6 000 € home-repair loan at Erste Bank in Zagreb, both serviced punctually. I own my apartment outright, as well as a 2012 Skoda Fabia. The additional installment will represent only 4 % of my income.  

While I currently use prepaid cards instead of a checking account, I plan to switch my payroll to your bank upon approval. Property ownership, consistent employment, and flawless past repayment attest to my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for evaluating my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss any details.  

Sincerely,  
Katarina Novak

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

My name is Derya Yılmaz, a 61-year-old Turkish-German dual citizen living in Stuttgart for the past two years. For the last four years I have been employed as a senior quality-control inspector at Bosch Rexroth, drawing a net income of 2 560 € per month. I am widowed and support my 24-year-old son who is completing vocational training.  

I am applying for a 2 012 € loan to fund a one-year postgraduate diploma in Lean Manufacturing at the Hochschule Esslingen. This study will strengthen my position for a forthcoming team-lead role that carries a 15 % salary increase.  

I maintain one active credit with your bank—originally 2 800 € for heating system upgrades, with 800 € remaining—and an external 5 000 € travel trailer loan at Sparkasse, both serviced without delay. I own my single-family home and a 2016 Ford Focus. The proposed installment equals about 4 % of my monthly income, well within my budgeting capacity.  

Although I have managed finances through a prepaid card, I am ready to open a checking account and move my salary deposits to your branch. My decades-long employment record, real-estate ownership, and spotless payment history make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your attention and for considering my request.  

Warm regards,  
Derya Yılmaz
