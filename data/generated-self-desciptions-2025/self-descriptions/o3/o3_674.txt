Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Markus Vogel, a self-employed architect from Bonn. I have run my own studio for nine years and earn on average 5,900 EUR net per month. The mortgage on my privately owned home is long since repaid, and the small renovation loan I took with your bank in 2018 has been serviced without a single delay.

I am requesting 10,366 EUR over 60 months to buy a new Volkswagen ID.3. Reliable, low-emission transport is essential for visiting construction sites across the region; my twelve-year-old diesel is no longer dependable.

Although I work only with a business account and therefore keep no private checking account, my accountant separates private drawings monthly. Liquid savings are limited (currently 65 EUR) because my surplus funds are invested in a life-insurance policy (surrender value 18,200 EUR) and a building-society contract that matures in 2029. These assets, together with my stable income and spotless payment record, underscore my creditworthiness. The planned instalment of about 180 EUR represents barely 3 % of my net income.

I am available at 0228-437912 for further information and will gladly supply the required documentation.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely  
Markus Vogel

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Daniel Kern, Senior Process Engineer at Siemens Energy in Erlangen, employed since April 2015. My annual gross salary is 92,000 EUR (approx. 4,850 EUR net per month). I own my apartment outright and have only one outstanding obligation: a home-improvement loan from your bank that I have serviced flawlessly since 2017.

I now seek 10,366 EUR for 60 months to purchase a new Škoda Octavia Combi. The car will ensure safe commuting and allow me to transport my five-year-old son reliably. A monthly payment of roughly 172 EUR is less than 4 % of my net income.

I do not use a conventional checking account; instead, all inflows and outflows pass through my money-market account. Immediate cash savings stand at 70 EUR, while long-term assets include a building-society agreement and a life-insurance policy worth a combined 36,400 EUR, both available as collateral.

With a secure position, stable income and a perfect repayment history, I am a dependable borrower. I can be reached at 09131-756443 for any questions.

Kind regards  
Daniel Kern

Dear Madam or Sir,

My name is Tobias Reuter, Chief Inspector with the Hesse State Police in Darmstadt. I have served for twelve years and earn 3,680 EUR net per month plus regular overtime. I own my house and have one current loan with your bank (for a heat-pump), serviced punctually since 2019.

I request a 10,366 EUR loan over 60 months to buy a new Opel Astra Sports-Tourer. The vehicle will replace my ageing car and enable me to manage shift changes and drive my 14-year-old nephew, who lives with me, to school. The envisaged instalment of around 170 EUR fits comfortably within my budget.

My salary is paid to a state treasury card, so I maintain no separate checking account. Short-term savings are minimal (80 EUR), as I allocate surplus funds to a life-insurance policy (surrender value 27,000 EUR) and a Bausparvertrag worth 48,000 EUR, both of which can be assigned as security.

Secure civil-service employment, a spotless credit record and tangible assets make me a reliable candidate. Please call 06151-449028 for any additional information.

Respectfully  
Tobias Reuter

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Stefan Lange, proprietor of “Lange’s Brasserie” in Leipzig, which I have operated profitably for eight years. My audited accounts show average personal drawings of 4,200 EUR net per month. I own my home and recently settled an equipment loan from your bank without incident.

To keep our delivery service efficient, I wish to buy a new electric Renault Kangoo and therefore apply for 10,366 EUR repayable over 60 months. The projected instalment of about 175 EUR is under 5 % of my monthly income.

Because daily takings flow straight into the restaurant’s account, I have never opened a separate checking account. Liquid cash on a savings pass is just 40 EUR; however, I hold a building-society contract valued at 31,500 EUR and a life-insurance policy insured for 150,000 EUR. These assets, combined with a long record of punctual repayments, offer solid security.

I am available at 0341-997744 for any queries and look forward to continuing our successful partnership.

Best regards  
Stefan Lange

Dear Members of the Loan Department,

My name is Oliver Beck, IT Project Manager at Deutsche Telekom in Cologne, employed since May 2013 with a net salary of 5,300 EUR per month. I own my house outright and have one active home-improvement loan with your bank that has been serviced flawlessly since 2018.

I am seeking 10,366 EUR over 60 months to purchase a new hybrid Toyota Corolla. The vehicle will replace my unreliable petrol car, lower commuting costs and allow regular visits to my teenage daughter, who lives 120 km away. The monthly payment of roughly 172 EUR equals only 3 % of my net income.

I operate exclusively with a salary card and therefore hold no checking account. Immediate cash savings total 90 EUR, while my building-society contract (value 42,700 EUR) and life-insurance policy (surrender value 23,600 EUR) provide substantial collateral.

With secure, well-paid employment, an excellent repayment record and transparent finances, I am a trustworthy borrower. I can be reached at 0221-656566 for further information.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely  
Oliver Beck
