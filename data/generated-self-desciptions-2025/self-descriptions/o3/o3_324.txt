Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Tomasz Kowalski, 34, Polish citizen living and working in Stuttgart since 2020. I run a small IT-security consultancy that I founded five years ago and have held the same trade-license number since. My average net income over the last twelve months is 4 300 DM, documented in the attached tax assessments. Because the company rents a flat for me near the office, my housing costs are zero.

I request a 2 910 DM loan to purchase a 2018 Opel Astra with 68 000 km. The car will allow me to reach clients outside the city and to bring my six-year-old son to kindergarten. I can comfortably cover the agreed rate-class 2 instalment of 125 DM per month; this equals less than 3 % of my net salary.

Although my current account shows a temporary overdraft of 180 DM (caused by quarterly VAT pre-payment), my only other credit with your bank—taken in 2022 for office equipment—has been repaid on schedule. I have never missed a payment, and no collection entries exist.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our reliable partnership.

Sincerely,
Tomasz Kowalski

Dear Credit Department,

I am Marco Santini, an Italian chef and general manager of “La Piazza” restaurant in Frankfurt. For the past four years I have been employed under unlimited contract, earning a steady 3 800 DM net each month. Meals and a staff apartment provided by the owner keep my living expenses low.

To replace my old scooter, I seek a 2 910 DM loan to buy a used Volkswagen Golf Variant (2017, 92 000 km). Reliable transport is essential for early-morning market visits and for taking my nine-year-old niece—my dependent since my sister’s passing—to school.

My checking account currently shows –75 DM, the result of paying annual school fees in advance. I possess only 60 DM in a savings pass, but I have no unpaid obligations. In 2021 I financed kitchen equipment through your bank and repaid the 18-month plan without delay.

I can commit to the proposed 120 DM monthly instalment—well within your rate level 2—and authorize automatic deduction on each payday.

I value punctuality in both cuisine and finance and would be honored to maintain that reputation with you.

Kind regards,
Marco Santini

To the Lending Team,

My name is Daniel Chen, 34, Taiwanese national working as a senior R&D engineer at Siemens Erlangen since April 2018. My current net salary is 4 750 DM. Employment confirmation for the last six years is enclosed.

I request financing of 2 910 DM for a certified used BMW 1-Series (2016) so I can commute to the company’s test facility 40 km away and transport my eight-year-old daughter safely. Company housing in the research campus is provided free of charge, giving me a high repayment capacity. I propose to amortize the loan in 24 instalments of 125 DM (rate category 2).

My giro account shows –120 DM after I advanced conference fees for my team; reimbursement is due next week. Apart from a laptop loan you granted me in 2020—settled two months early—I have no other debts, and my SCHUFA record is clean.

I appreciate the bank’s support of international specialists and trust my proven payment history and stable, well-paid employment meet your criteria.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,
Daniel Chen

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Ahmed El-Sayed, have served as a planning officer at the Munich Regional Council for four years and seven months. My permanent civil-service contract provides a net monthly income of 3 900 DM. The authority supplies a staff apartment, so I pay no rent.

I am applying for a 2 910 DM loan to purchase a 2015 Toyota Auris, 80 000 km, enabling field inspections across Upper Bavaria and weekend visits with my seven-year-old son, who lives with his mother. Public transport cannot cover many rural sites I inspect.

My checking account currently shows a negative balance of 95 DM following the annual health-insurance co-payment. I hold a minor savings balance of 50 DM. In 2022 I completed a 12-month credit with your bank for household appliances without missing a single instalment.

With only one dependent and virtually no housing cost, the planned 120 DM monthly repayment fits comfortably within my budget. Payroll deduction authorization is attached.

I am committed to the same reliability in my finances that I practice in public service.

Yours faithfully,
Ahmed El-Sayed

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Ivan Petrov, Bulgarian mechanical engineer employed as production manager at Bosch Bamberg since May 2019. My documented net income averages 4 200 DM. Company policy provides a rent-free studio near the plant.

I seek a 2 910 DM credit to acquire a 2017 Ford Focus (85 000 km). The vehicle is vital for late-shift rotations and for caring for my dependent—my nephew, age eight—whom I support after my brother’s accident.

Though my current account is –60 DM, caused by funding my nephew’s language course, I maintain an impeccable credit record. The only previous financing through your bank, a 3 000 DM relocation loan taken in 2021, was paid off exactly as scheduled.

I am comfortable with the bank’s rate-class 2 instalment of 125 DM monthly, representing less than 3 % of my income. Salary transfer statements and employment confirmation are enclosed.

I value the trust you have placed in me before and look forward to another successful cooperation.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov
