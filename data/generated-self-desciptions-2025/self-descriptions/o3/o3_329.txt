Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am applying for a two-year instalment loan of 1 525 € to finance a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to commute reliably to the hospital where I work as a scientific laboratory technician. I have been employed full time at Charité Campus Benjamin Franklin since February 2020 and earn a net salary of 3 050 € per month.  

My existing mortgage with your bank has been served punctually for the past three years, and I have never missed or delayed a payment on any prior credit. I have no other debts or instalment plans and keep a savings balance that fluctuates around 4 200 €. The requested loan would raise my monthly obligations at your bank from 489 € to 566 €, well below the 35 % of income threshold I have set for myself.  

Although I do not currently hold a checking account, all repayments would be executed via standing order from my savings account. With a stable income, an excellent repayment record, and collateral in the form of my current vehicle, I believe I am a reliable candidate.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Becker

Dear Loan Committee,  

I respectfully request a 1 525 € loan over 24 months to purchase a new VW Up! so I can continue my late-shift duties at St. Josef Hospital. As a registered nurse employed since May 2019, I take home 2 850 € monthly.  

My credit history is spotless; I paid off an education loan last year and have maintained a home-ownership loan with your branch for 18 months without incident. I own my condominium outright with my husband and have 3 600 € in a savings bond, which serves as emergency backing. Aside from household expenses for our two children, I hold no other financial obligations.  

The projected repayment of roughly 65 € per month fits easily into my budget and will be set up via direct debit from my savings account. I believe my stable civil-service-linked employment and prior diligence in meeting all obligations demonstrate my trustworthiness.  

I would be grateful for your positive decision and am available for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Anna Schmidt

Dear Ms. Reuter,  

I wish to obtain a 1 525 € personal loan for the purchase of a Škoda Fabia. Dependable transport is vital for my position as a revenue officer at the Cologne tax office, where I have worked since November 2019 with a secure monthly net income of 3 200 €.  

I currently service only one liability—my 2017 home-improvement loan with your bank—which has been repaid on schedule every month. My savings account holds 2 100 €, and I possess a paid-off 2014 Ford Fiesta that I plan to trade in as partial payment for the new car.  

With no guarantors and no additional instalment plans, the proposed repayment of about 64 € per month poses no strain on my budget. I will authorise automatic deductions to ensure punctuality.  

My consistent public-sector employment, proven payment discipline, and modest loan amount make me a low-risk applicant. I look forward to extending our excellent cooperation.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Fischer

To the Loans Department,  

I am requesting a 1 525 € loan repayable over 24 months to purchase a new Hyundai i10, replacing my twelve-year-old patrol car substitute. I have served as a police sergeant in the Bavarian State Police since April 2021 and earn 3 150 € net monthly plus shift allowances.  

My only current credit with your bank—a small renovation loan taken in 2022—has been paid punctually each month. Aside from that, I carry no debt. I maintain a reserve of 1 900 € in a savings account and own my townhouse, free of liens.  

The planned instalment of 65 € will be covered through a standing debit from my savings, ensuring timely payment. My public-service tenure, clean credit record, and tangible assets underscore my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am ready to supply any additional documentation you may require.  

Sincerely,  
Sabine Kraus

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am applying for a 1 525 € vehicle loan, to be amortised over two years, for a new Renault Clio that will secure my daily commute to Jena where I work as an IT support specialist at Carl Zeiss AG. I have held this position since June 2020 and earn 3 400 € net per month.  

My financial standing is solid: a home loan with your bank has been serviced flawlessly for three years, and I disbursed a study loan last December. I hold 4 700 € in a growth savings plan and possess a fully paid 2012 Toyota Yaris that I will sell upon acquiring the new car.  

With no other instalment commitments, the expected 64 € monthly repayment represents less than 2 % of my net income. Automated transfer orders will guarantee punctual servicing.  

Given my stable career, consistent repayment history, and healthy savings buffer, I am confident in presenting myself as a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Katrin Lange
