Letter 1 – Karl Hoffmann

Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a DM 6,468 loan to purchase a 2016 VW Golf Variant with 78,000 km. After twenty-two years as general manager of the Rhein-Main Park Hotel in Wiesbaden, I was laid off last autumn when the property changed owners, and my search for new employment is well under way. Reliable transportation is essential both for interviews and for taking my 17-year-old daughter to school.

My current checking balance is DM 154, and I have one existing loan with your bank (originally DM 3,500, remaining DM 680); every installment has been paid on time. I own my home at Jakob-Kaiser-Str. 18, valued at roughly DM 410,000, free of any liens. Although I do not keep a separate savings account, the house, my 12-month severance package (DM 4,800 still available), and unemployment benefits ensure I can meet the projected monthly payment of DM 324 over the 20-month term.

I have banked with you for fourteen years, never missed a payment, and remain reachable by telephone at any time. I look forward to continuing our reliable partnership.

Sincerely,
Karl Hoffmann


Letter 2 – Dr. Johannes Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a DM 6,468 auto loan to acquire a 2015 Opel Astra for use in my work as an independent statistical consultant. Until June this year I was senior officer at the Federal Statistical Office; my position was eliminated during restructuring, and I have since begun contract work that will require frequent travel to clients in Frankfurt and Mainz.

I maintain a current account with your branch in Mainz holding DM 121. My previous education loan (DM 9,800) was repaid six months ahead of schedule, and I have one small active credit with you (DM 1,250 remaining), also serviced punctually. I own a mortgage-free terraced house on Beethovenstr. 9, valued at approximately DM 370,000, which secures my overall financial standing. My 32-year-old disabled son lives with me, so dependable transport is necessary for medical appointments as well.

Unemployment insurance plus two signed consulting contracts will comfortably cover the DM 324 monthly installment. My impeccable payment record, stable collateral, and transparent income make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Dr. Johannes Müller

To the Credit Department,

I seek financing of DM 6,468 for a used 2014 Ford Transit Connect (90,000 km) needed to relaunch my freelance architecture practice. For fourteen years I headed Berger & Partner Architekten in Darmstadt; when our main client canceled a large project in March, I had to release staff and pause operations. New projects start in January, and a small van is essential for site visits and transporting models.

My checking account shows DM 167. I have never defaulted on any obligation and repaid a DM 20,000 equipment loan last year without delay. My only current credit with you is a DM 2,300 personal line, paid down to DM 700. I reside in and own outright a two-family house on Lessingweg 4 (market value about DM 450,000), which also yields DM 650 monthly rental income. I support one university-age son.

Projected revenue from two signed design contracts plus rental income ensures the DM 324 monthly repayment fits easily within my budget. My history with the bank over nineteen years demonstrates reliability, and my property provides solid collateral.

I appreciate your positive evaluation of my request.

Respectfully,
Dipl.-Ing. Stefan Berger

Dear Loans Officer,

Please consider my application for a DM 6,468 loan to buy a 2013 Mercedes-Benz C-200 with 110,000 km. After thirty-five years in the Bundeswehr, I retired last year and am presently between positions while awaiting security-consulting assignments that require my own vehicle. I also care for my 14-year-old grandson, and public transport in our rural district of Bad Kissingen is insufficient.

My current account balance is DM 143. The only active credit I have with your bank is a home-improvement loan (remaining balance DM 1,050), always paid punctually. I own a debt-free farmhouse on Hauptstr. 2, appraised at DM 320,000, which underpins my financial stability. My military pension of DM 3,400 monthly more than covers the projected DM 324 installment.

I have decades of disciplined financial conduct, a permanent pension, and significant real-estate equity, making me a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.

Sincerely,
Captain (ret.) Dieter Weiß


Letter 5 – Michael Fischer

Dear Ms. Schubert,

I am requesting a DM 6,468 auto loan to purchase a 2017 Ford Focus with 85,000 km. Until April I served as Chief Financial Officer for HansaTech GmbH; after its merger my position was eliminated, and I now pursue interim finance leadership roles that require reliable transportation across southern Germany. The vehicle will also be used to care for my 12-year-old son, who lives with me following divorce.

My checking account currently holds DM 159. I have an impeccable repayment record, having cleared a DM 15,000 mortgage bridge loan two years early. The single open facility with your bank—a DM 2,800 line of credit—stands at DM 600 and is serviced by direct debit. I own a condominium on Lindauer Allee 33 valued at roughly DM 360,000 and free of encumbrances. Severance savings and unemployment benefits provide DM 4,200 of monthly liquidity, easily covering the DM 324 payment.

My professional background in finance, spotless credit history, and solid asset base assure you of my reliability.

I look forward to your positive reply.

Best regards,
Michael Fischer
