Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Elena Petrova, 24, a Bulgarian citizen living in Dresden since 2019. For the past five years I have been employed full-time as a housekeeping attendant at the Maritim Hotel (net income ≈ 1,550 EUR/month). I respectfully apply for a loan of 4,811 EUR to purchase a 2009 Opel Corsa so I can reach early and late shifts that public transport does not cover.  

All my financial obligations have been honored to date: an 800 EUR consumer loan from your bank was repaid three months ahead of schedule, and my current store-installment plan for a refrigerator (34 EUR/month) has never been in arrears. Although I do not yet maintain a checking account, I hold a Schwäbisch-Hall Bauspar contract (target sum 7,000 EUR, contributions up to date) and life insurance with Allianz. My rent is 510 EUR including utilities, leaving ample room for a new installment of about 100 EUR, well within your rate class 2.  

I am divorced with one child (shared custody, no alimony obligations). I have lived at my present address for four years and intend to stay long term. My steady employment record, clean repayment history, and documented income demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at any time for further information and look forward to a positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Aisha Khan, 24, a Pakistani national working since April 2020 as a patient-care aide at St.-Hedwig-Klinik in Berlin (net salary 1,620 EUR). I seek financing of 4,811 EUR to buy a used 2011 Ford Fiesta so I can cover night shifts and transport my six-year-old daughter to school.  

During the past four years I have successfully repaid a 1,200 EUR education loan with your institution without a single late payment. Apart from a 25 EUR/month store plan for furniture, I hold no other debts. I contribute 40 EUR/month to a Barmenia life-insurance policy, which also serves as disability coverage.  

Although I do not possess a current account, my salary is paid onto a prepaid debit card, and I enclose statements confirming stable inflows. My rent is 480 EUR; even after household expenses I can comfortably service an 95 EUR monthly installment.  

Separated since 2022, I have been resident at Müllerstraße 213 for exactly four years. My consistent employment, verified income, and spotless credit history make me a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for your attention. I am happy to provide any additional documents you may require.  

Respectfully,  
Aisha Khan

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Ana Rodrigues, a 24-year-old Portuguese bakery assistant employed at Bäckerei Huber in Stuttgart since June 2018 (net pay 1,570 EUR). I am requesting a 4,811 EUR loan to purchase a reliable 2010 VW Polo to replace costly ride-sharing and secure punctual deliveries during 5 a.m. shifts.  

In 2021 I took a 900 EUR consumer loan from your branch and repaid it on schedule. I currently have a 28 EUR/month installment plan with MediaMarkt, also paid punctually. I own a Bauspar savings agreement with LBS (current balance 1,900 EUR) and a small Ergo life-insurance policy.  

My monthly rent is 495 EUR. Even with child expenses for my seven-year-old son, my disposable income exceeds 400 EUR, leaving room for the proposed 98 EUR installment at rate class 2. I have no guarantors or additional debts.  

I have lived at my present address for four years and intend to renew the lease. As a married resident permit holder with an uninterrupted employment record and proven repayment discipline, I believe I present minimal risk.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope for a favorable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Ana Rodrigues

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Sofia Hernandez, 24, a Spanish national residing in Cologne since 2019. For the last four years I have been a warehouse picker at DHL Supply Chain (net earnings 1,630 EUR). I request a loan of 4,811 EUR to buy a 2012 Skoda Fabia Kombi, necessary for commuting to the night shift and transporting my daughter to daycare.  

My only previous borrowing experience is a 700 EUR loan from your bank, settled in full last December. I also have a 30 EUR/month store credit for a washing machine, never overdue. I hold a Bauspar contract with Volksbank (target 8,000 EUR) as well as a Zurich life-insurance policy.  

I rent a small flat for 505 EUR. After regular expenses I can comfortably meet an installment of around 100 EUR, matching rate class 2. I maintain no checking account but salary statements prove continuous inflow.  

Divorced in 2021, I have been at my current residence for exactly four years. My stable employment, punctual repayment record, and existing insurance coverage demonstrate my reliability.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Sofia Hernandez

Loan Department  
XYZ Bank  

I am Lijuan Zhang, 24, Chinese citizen, living in Frankfurt for four years. Since May 2019 I have worked as an assembly-line operator at Continental Automotive, earning approximately 1,690 EUR net per month. I wish to finance 4,811 EUR to acquire a 2011 Renault Clio, enabling flexible transport to rotating shifts and weekend German classes.  

I successfully repaid a 1,000 EUR relocation loan with your bank one year ago and currently carry only a 27 EUR/month furniture installment with IKEA. A Debeka life-insurance policy and a Bauspar contract (current balance 2,100 EUR) serve as my modest assets.  

My rent is 520 EUR. Based on my budget overview, a 100 EUR monthly payment fits well within my disposable income, satisfying your installment-rate category 2. I do not have a checking account yet but enclose six months of payroll statements deposited on a prepaid Mastercard.  

Separated with one dependent, I have demonstrated financial discipline and intend to remain long-term in Frankfurt. I therefore believe I am a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my request. I am available for any further questions and hope to hear from you soon.  

With best regards,  
Lijuan Zhang
