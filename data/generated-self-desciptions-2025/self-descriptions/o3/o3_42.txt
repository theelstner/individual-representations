Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 2,333 DM consumer loan to purchase a combined digital radio-television set for my apartment. The device will allow my eight-year-old son and me to follow German language programs that support his schooling and my continuing business-management courses.

I am a Spanish citizen who has worked as an assistant floor manager at Wilhelm & Sohn Maschinenbau GmbH in Stuttgart for the past eight years. My net income averages 3,900 DM per month. I own my condominium (paid for with personal funds) and a 2019 Opel Corsa. I keep 780 DM in a savings account with your branch; I have never opened a checking account because my salary is paid onto a prepaid payroll card.

Three years ago I took a 5,000 DM renovation loan from your bank and have repaid 4,400 DM so far, always on schedule. My installment rate request of 4% fits comfortably within my monthly budget, even after child-care costs.

My stable employment, spotless repayment record, and modest existing debt demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Franko Delgado

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a 2,333 DM loan to buy a smart TV-radio unit for my home office. As an independent tax consultant, reliable access to financial news channels is essential for the reports I prepare for clients.

I have lived in Germany since 2012 and have run my licensed practice in Mannheim for the last nine years. Annual after-tax earnings average 93,000 DM; monthly disposable income exceeds 4,500 DM. My savings account with you currently holds 640 DM, and I drive a fully paid VW Passat. I do not maintain a checking account, preferring to manage cash flow through my business account at the tax chamber.

Two years ago I borrowed 8,000 DM from your bank for office furniture. That loan was repaid six months early. I have no other liabilities, and my mortgage-free townhouse ensures stable housing costs. The requested installment rate of 4% equals roughly 95 DM per month—well within my budget.

My proven repayment discipline and long professional standing make me a low-risk applicant. I appreciate your favorable assessment.

Kind regards,  
Murat Aydin

Esteemed Credit Committee,

Please accept my application for a 2,333 DM loan to purchase a new 55-inch television and DAB+ radio for my residence. The equipment will enable me to follow international logistics feeds that support my role as operations manager at RheinCargo AG.

I have been employed by RheinCargo for eight years, earning 4,200 DM net monthly. I am 30 years old, single, and support my younger brother, who is studying in Poland. I own a small house in Köln (acquired without mortgage) and a Skoda Octavia. My savings account balance stands at 720 DM; I have never felt the need for a checking account.

Four years ago I took a 3,500 DM education loan from your institution to finish a supply-chain certificate. That credit was repaid precisely on schedule, and I have maintained a flawless Schufa record. The planned installment rate of 4% represents less than 2.5 % of my net income.

Given my steady salary, limited financial commitments, and impeccable repayment history, I am confident I meet your risk criteria. I look forward to your positive response.

Respectfully,  
Piotr Lewandowski

Dear Ms. Keller,

I am writing to request a 2,333 DM consumer loan for the purchase of a high-definition radio-television unit. As a lieutenant in the Bundeswehr medical corps stationed in Ulm, I often study surgical broadcasts and training videos after hours; the new device will significantly improve that learning process.

I have served full-time for seven years, with a guaranteed net income of 4,600 DM each month and secure tenure for at least another decade. I reside in a condominium I bought two years ago and own a Hyundai i30. My current savings with your bank total 560 DM. Because my salary is paid onto a military card, I have not opened a personal checking account.

I previously financed a 6,000 DM compact car through your bank and paid it off last month in accordance with the original schedule. I carry no other debts. At the requested installment rate of 4%, the monthly payment will be comfortably covered by my discretionary income.

My stable government position and flawless repayment record establish me as a dependable borrower. Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,  
Lt. Joon-Ho Park

To the Credit Department,

I am applying for a 2,333 DM loan to buy a multifunction smart TV and Internet radio for my home in Heidelberg. The set will aid my five-year-old daughter’s language development and allow me to watch market briefings relevant to my work as a senior data analyst.

I moved from India to Germany ten years ago and have been with BASF SE for the past eight years, currently earning 5,200 DM net per month. I own my apartment (no mortgage) and a fully paid Ford Fiesta. My savings account with your bank holds 830 DM. I rely on a prepaid debit card for daily expenses and therefore do not maintain a checking account.

Three years ago I took a 4,500 DM personal loan from your branch to finance postgraduate coursework; I have repaid 91 % of it and remain fully on schedule. I have no other liabilities. The proposed 4% installment corresponds to about 95 DM monthly, which is well within my budget after living expenses.

My strong income, conservative spending habits, and spotless credit history make me a reliable candidate. I look forward to your approval.

Warm regards,  
Arvind Patel
