Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Mehmet Kaya, age 45, married, with a seven-year-old son. For the past nine years I have worked as a warehouse forklift operator at Berliner Logistik GmbH. I am applying for a DM 339 loan to finance a six-week instructor course that will qualify me to train new forklift drivers. The certificate will add DM 180 net to my monthly salary and open supervisory positions that my current “unskilled” status prevents.

My checking account is presently overdrawn by DM 38 after school expenses, and my savings balance is DM 54. Nevertheless, I have never missed a payment: the DM 500 appliance loan I took from your branch in 2021 was repaid three months early. I own a 2004 Opel Astra and the small row house my family occupies; both are fully insured and regularly maintained. I carry no other debts or guarantees.

With steady employment, verified overtime income, and a flawless repayment record, I am confident I can meet a twelve-month schedule of roughly DM 30 per month. Thank you for considering my request.

Respectfully,
Mehmet Kaya

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Viktor Petrov, 45, married, resident in Bremen for one year after relocating from Hamburg. I have worked eight years as a night-shift security guard at Hafen Security AG and now wish to take the IHK “Geprüfte Schutz- und Sicherheitskraft” retraining course. The fee is DM 339, for which I seek your loan.

My current account shows an overdraft of DM 62 caused by annual school fees for my daughter. I keep DM 65 in a passbook account. I own a 2002 VW Golf and a 55 m² condominium, both free of liens except the mortgage already serviced through your bank and always paid on time. In 2019 I borrowed DM 800 for dental work and cleared it without a single delay.

The requested loan will be repaid in twelve instalments of about DM 29, which fits comfortably within my monthly net income of DM 2 300. My consistent payment history and stable employment underscore my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Viktor Petrov

To the Credit Department,

My name is Carlos Martinez, age 45, Bulgarian citizen, widower with one dependent daughter. For ten years I have been employed by the city’s sanitation service in Stuttgart. I seek DM 339 to attend an evening course in heavy-vehicle maintenance that will allow me to move into a higher-paid workshop position.

My checking account stands at –DM 27 after rent withdrawal; my savings book contains DM 80. I own a 2003 Ford Transit, fully paid, and our terraced house, for which the mortgage is current. In 2020 I took a DM 500 personal loan from you and repaid it exactly as scheduled.

The proposed twelve-month plan of DM 29 a month represents less than 2 % of my net pay, ensuring easy servicing. My spotless repayment record, stable job and ownership of property make me a low-risk applicant.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Kind regards,
Carlos Martinez

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Ahmed Hassan, 45, married with one son, originally from Egypt and resident in Garmisch-Partenkirchen for the past year. I have held the position of hotel maintenance assistant at Alpenblick Hotel for twelve years. I request a DM 339 loan to enroll in a certified heating-and-ventilation technician course, which the hotel will reward with a DM 250 monthly raise upon completion.

My current account shows –DM 15; my savings total DM 32. Aside from my mortgage with your bank, which has never been in arrears, I have no debts. A DM 600 consumer credit taken in 2022 was repaid three months early. I own a 1999 Toyota Corolla and the small cottage we inhabit.

The repayment schedule of roughly DM 30 over twelve months is easily covered by my present net income of DM 2 100 and will be even safer once the raise is in place. My history with your bank demonstrates dependable behaviour.

I appreciate your consideration.

Warm regards,
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,

I am Stefan Ionescu, age 45, married, supporting my elderly mother as one dependent. I have worked 8½ years on the assembly line at AutoTech AG. To progress, I need a CNC-operator evening course costing DM 339, hence this application.

My current balance is –DM 9 after utility payments; I hold DM 95 in a savings account. I own a 2001 Škoda Fabia and the 60 m² flat my family moved into twelve months ago; mortgage and insurance premiums have always been paid punctually. In 2018 I borrowed DM 700 from your branch and repaid it exactly on schedule.

With monthly net earnings of DM 2 400, the projected DM 29 instalment over twelve months will not strain my budget. My consistent employment, property ownership and perfect repayment history make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for considering my request.

Yours faithfully,
Stefan Ionescu
