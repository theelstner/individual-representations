Dear Loan Committee,

My name is María López, a 31-year-old Spanish national living in Stuttgart since 2023. I have run my own graphic-design studio here for five years and report an average net monthly income of 3,800 DM. Two years ago I financed a plot of land through your bank and repaid the 18-month loan on schedule, which is reflected in my flawless credit record.  
I now request a 2,782 DM loan over 21 months to purchase a new electric city car that will allow me to visit clients and deliver design mock-ups independently; at present I share an unreliable 15-year-old hatchback. I hold 650 DM in a savings bond, no other debt, and my mortgage-free condominium provides additional security. The installment of roughly 140 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget, leaving more than 40 % of my income as free cash flow.  
My consistent earnings, prior punctual repayment history, and tangible collateral make me a reliable borrower. I am ready to open a checking account with you so that the installment can be debited automatically.

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
María López


Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dr. Anika Patel, an Indian researcher employed for 4 ½ years at Novomed Pharma AG in Frankfurt, where I earn 4,200 DM net per month. Following my recent divorce I live with my six-year-old daughter in an owner-occupied apartment purchased with personal savings. Two years ago I cleared a 12-month furniture loan with your bank without a single delay, which is documented in my credit file.  
I am applying for a 2,782 DM loan, to be repaid over 21 months, to buy a reliable hybrid vehicle for commuting to our laboratory campus 25 km away. I currently depend on unreliable public transport that extends my working day by up to two hours. I keep 720 DM in a savings account, have no co-signers or other liabilities, and plan to channel the agreed installment through the checking account I intend to open at your branch.  
My stable employment contract, proven payment discipline, and conservative budget planning demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Anika Patel


To the Lending Department,

My name is Lieutenant Sophie Dubois, a 31-year-old French Air Force officer on a seven-year exchange assignment at NATO Airbase Geilenkirchen. I earn a tax-exempt service salary equivalent to 3,600 DM net monthly. Two years ago I bought my house near the base with down-payment savings; I hold 560 DM in a Bundespost savings account and own a motorcycle. I previously financed officers’ training materials through your bank and settled the balance three months ahead of schedule.  
I request a 2,782 DM loan for 21 months to purchase a compact family car. My current motorcycle limits me when transporting my husband and our toddler, especially during winter. The proposed monthly installment of roughly 140 DM represents less than 4 % of my income, leaving ample reserve for unforeseen costs.  
Given my secure government post, immaculate repayment record, and existing property, I trust you will find my application solid. I will gladly open a checking account to facilitate automatic payments.

Respectfully,  
Lt. Sophie Dubois


Dear Credit Officer,

I am Elena Rossi, an Italian management consultant employed by Stratovia GmbH in Cologne since 2019. My net monthly pay averages 4,500 DM, supplemented by annual performance bonuses. In 2022 I obtained a small 1,500 DM household-appliance loan from your bank and repaid it flawlessly.  
I seek a 2,782 DM loan over 21 months to buy a fuel-efficient hatchback for frequent client visits; taxi receipts currently reduce my net income by about 350 DM per month. I maintain 800 DM in a postal savings bond, have no additional debts, and live mortgage-free in a townhouse jointly owned with my spouse. One child depends on me. The anticipated installment will be comfortably covered and automatically debited from the checking account I will open with you.  
Stable high income, consistent credit discipline, and existing assets make me a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for your time and favourable review.  
Sincerely,  
Elena Rossi


Esteemed Members of the Credit Board,

My name is Katarzyna Nowak, a Polish entrepreneur who has operated “Sunrise Organic Bakery” in Dresden for the past four years, earning an average net profit of 3,200 DM monthly after taxes. In 2021 I financed a commercial oven through your bank and repaid the 24-month note exactly on schedule, thus establishing positive credit history with you.  
I now wish to finance a reliable delivery van for 2,782 DM over 21 months. The vehicle will replace my aging compact car, which can no longer handle larger wholesale orders. I possess 690 DM in a Sparkasse savings account, have no outstanding liabilities, and reside with my son in a fully paid townhouse. The prospective monthly payment of about 140 DM represents under 5 % of my average cash flow, ensuring stress-free servicing.  
My proven business income, property ownership, and impeccable repayment track record confirm that I am a trustworthy applicant. I will open a checking account to streamline the payment process.

I appreciate your consideration.  
Warm regards,  
Katarzyna Nowak
