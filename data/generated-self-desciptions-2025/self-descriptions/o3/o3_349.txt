Stuttgart, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ana Petrović, a 23-year-old Croatian national living in Stuttgart since 2021. I am divorced and care for my three-year-old son Luka. I am requesting a loan of 3 758 DM to purchase a modern television and DAB+ radio set that I need for the distance-learning bookkeeping course I start in October; all lessons and exams are broadcast on the local education channel.

Although I am currently registered as unemployed, I receive 1 240 DM a month in unemployment benefits and child support. I keep a tight budget: my current account balance is 118 DM and I have 650 DM in a savings book. I have rented the same flat for four years and always pay on time.

In 2023 I took a 1 500 DM micro-loan with your bank to furnish my son’s room and repaid every instalment punctually; the last payment was booked in July. My flawless repayment record and the savings I maintain each month demonstrate my reliability. I am asking for a 24-month term, which would make the monthly instalment well within 10 % of my guaranteed income.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my good relationship with the bank.

Sincerely,  
Ana Petrović

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is María Fernández, a 23-year-old Spanish citizen who has lived in Hamburg for four years. I am married; my husband works at sea eight months a year and sends regular support. I seek a 3 758 DM loan to buy a studio-quality smart TV, radio receiver and related accessories so I can launch a fee-based online Spanish-language tutorial channel this winter.

Financially, I receive 1 100 DM monthly in unemployment allowance plus an average of 600 DM in freelance translation income and 500 DM from my husband. My checking account currently holds 143 DM; my savings bond stands at 820 DM. Rent has been paid without delay since I moved in.

Two years ago your branch granted me a 2 000 DM consumer loan; I settled it five months early. This perfect repayment history, together with my diversified income sources, attests to my creditworthiness. I request a 24-month repayment period which would keep the instalment comfortably below 15 % of proven monthly income.

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.

Kind regards,  
María Fernández

Dear Credit Department,

I am Olena Koval, 23, a Ukrainian resident of Leipzig since 2021 and single mother to a two-year-old daughter. I am applying for a 3 758 DM loan to purchase an interactive television and digital radio package essential for the language-immersion nursing aide course I begin next semester; lectures are broadcast live and require compatible equipment.

My current income consists of 1 150 DM monthly unemployment benefits and 300 DM child allowance. I keep 97 DM in my checking account and 720 DM in savings. I have lived in the same rented apartment for the past four years and have never missed a payment.

Last year I repaid a 1 200 DM instalment loan with your bank precisely on schedule. This, together with my modest but steady income and disciplined spending, shows I am a dependable borrower. A 24-month term would mean a manageable instalment of roughly 160 DM, which I can cover comfortably.

Thank you for considering my request. I remain available for any additional information.

Respectfully,  
Olena Koval

Esteemed Loan Committee,

My name is Laila Haddad, a 23-year-old Moroccan national residing in Köln since 2020. I am married; my husband is completing studies abroad and sends 400 DM monthly. I seek a 3 758 DM loan to buy an internet-enabled television and radio kit that will enable me to follow the preparatory e-learning modules for the retail apprenticeship I start in December.

I currently receive 1 000 DM unemployment benefit, 400 DM from my husband and 200 DM from occasional babysitting. My checking account balance is 131 DM and I have 950 DM in a savings account. I have rented the same flat for four years and have no other debts.

Eighteen months ago your bank granted me a 1 300 DM loan to cover relocation costs; all 18 instalments were paid exactly on the due date. My impeccable record, stable support payments and upcoming employment contract make me a low-risk applicant. I propose a 24-month repayment plan.

Thank you for your confidence and consideration.

Warm regards,  
Laila Haddad

Dear Banking Team,

I am Sofia Ivanova, 23, Bulgarian, separated and the sole caregiver of my four-year-old son. I request a 3 758 DM loan to purchase a large-screen TV, satellite radio set and accessories to set up a small pay-per-view corner in the local Bulgarian community centre, a project that is expected to generate approximately 350 DM of monthly side income.

At present I receive 1 050 DM unemployment allowance and average 250 DM from part-time housekeeping jobs. My checking account holds 125 DM; my savings deposit is 560 DM. I have lived at the same rented address for four years, always paying on time.

Two years ago I took a 1 000 DM personal loan from this bank and settled it without a single delay. My prior punctuality, clear revenue plan for the new equipment and modest but steady income assure you of my reliability. A 24-month schedule fits comfortably within my budget.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your favourable reply.

Sincerely,  
Sofia Ivanova
