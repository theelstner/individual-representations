Hilden, 12 June 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Anna Keller, 28, divorced, and the mother of a five-year-old son. Since February 2021 I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at Bayer AG in Leverkusen, earning a steady net salary of €3,100 per month. I have rented the same apartment in Hilden for four years and have always paid my rent and utilities on time.

I am applying for a €2,603 loan over 24 months to purchase a 2017 used VW Golf. The vehicle will replace my aging Fiat Punto and ensure reliable daily commuting to the Bayer campus as well as weekend visits to my son’s school activities.

My financial standing is solid. I keep €2,800 in my savings account and maintain a small paid-off 2019 furniture loan (€1,200) that I settled three months early. I have no other debts, credit cards, or overdrafts, and I have never been in arrears. Because my wages are credited directly to a payroll card, I have not opened a separate checking account, but I will gladly allow the bank to debit the monthly installments from my savings book.

I value punctuality and transparency and am prepared to provide all documentation you may require. I am confident that my stable employment, positive repayment record, and existing savings make me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Anna Keller

Letter 2  
Offenbach, 10 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Silva, 28, separated, with a three-year-old daughter. I have worked as an officer with German Customs at Frankfurt Airport since October 2022, drawing a net monthly income of €3,400. I have lived in my rented Offenbach flat for four years.

I seek a €2,603 loan, payable over 24 months, to buy a 2018 Opel Astra with 92,000 km. Shift work requires dependable transport in the early morning and late evening when public transit is limited.

I currently hold €1,500 in a savings account. In 2022 I borrowed €2,000 from your bank for vocational training; that loan was repaid in full this February, ahead of schedule. I carry no other credit obligations, overdrafts, or credit cards, and I have never missed a payment. Because my salary is transferred to a prepaid payroll card issued by the Federal Customs Administration, I do not maintain a separate checking account.

Given my secure civil-service position, consistent payment history, and available savings buffer, I am confident of meeting the proposed monthly installments of roughly €110. I would welcome the opportunity to prove my reliability once more.

Thank you for reviewing my request.

Kind regards,  
Maria Silva

Munich, 14 June 2025  

To the Credit Department,

I am Ewa Kowalski, 28, married, with one two-year-old son. Since May 2022 I have been a qualified IT systems technician at Siemens AG in Munich, earning €3,250 net each month. I have rented the same apartment in Sendling for four years.

I am requesting a €2,603, 24-month loan to purchase a 2019 Škoda Octavia (used) to facilitate the daily school run and my commute to the Neuperlach campus.

Financially, I am conservative. I hold €3,700 in a savings account, own an older scooter valued at about €900, and have no revolving credit. An €1,800 language-course loan you granted me in 2021 was repaid exactly on schedule this April. I have never had payment delays. My salary is deposited to a company payroll card, so I have not felt the need for a checking account, but I authorize the bank to debit installments directly from my savings.

My stable employment, substantial savings relative to the loan amount, and flawless credit history demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ewa Kowalski

Letter 4  
Hamburg, 11 June 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Sofia Garza, 28, divorced, and a permanent resident of Germany. Since January 2023 I have worked as a senior administrative clerk at Hamburg City Hall, earning €2,980 net monthly. I have rented the same apartment in Altona for four years.

I am applying for a €2,603 loan over 24 months to purchase a reliable 2016 Ford Focus. The car will allow me to visit satellite offices and care for my elderly father, my sole dependent, who lives 15 km outside the city.

My savings account currently holds €1,200. In March 2023 I closed an €800 household-appliance loan with your bank on time. I have no other debts or outstanding obligations. Though I handle everyday payments with a prepaid debit card and therefore lack a checking account, I am willing to open one if it facilitates the loan process.

I possess German indefinite work authorization, a steady public-sector income, and an impeccable repayment record—qualities I hope will assure you of my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Respectfully,  
Sofia Garza

Letter 5  
Berlin, 13 June 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Luisa Rossi, 28, separated, with a six-year-old daughter. I have been a certified medical assistant at St. Joseph Hospital in Berlin since August 2021, earning €3,050 net monthly. I have lived in the same rented flat in Neukölln for the past four years.

I request a €2,603 loan over 24 months to purchase a 2017 Renault Clio. The vehicle will support my expanded duties involving home-care visits to patients in the outer districts.

I maintain €4,100 in a savings account and own a modest 2005 scooter. A previous €2,200 dental-care loan from your bank was repaid two months early in December 2024. I hold no other installment plans or credit cards. Because my salary is loaded onto the hospital’s payroll card, I have not opened a checking account, but I authorize direct debits from my savings account for the installments, which will be comfortably covered by my monthly budget.

My consistent employment, strong savings, and spotless repayment history underscore my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at any time should you need further information.

Warm regards,  
Luisa Rossi
