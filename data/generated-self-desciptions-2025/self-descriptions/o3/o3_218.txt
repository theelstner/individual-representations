Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Mark Neumann, age 31, employed as a scientific research technician at Deutsche Bahn’s innovation centre in Frankfurt since April 2020 (5½ years). I am requesting a business loan of 3,104 DM, to be repaid over 18 months in monthly instalments of roughly 175 DM, to equip a mobile bicycle-repair service I will run on weekends. The funds will cover a cargo e-bike, specialised tools and a booking app licence.  

Financially, my net salary averages 4,050 DM per month. I currently show a 120 DM overdraft caused by an annual property-tax debit, but otherwise manage my account prudently. I have no unpaid debts; the small 1,200 DM appliance loan I took with your bank in 2022 has never been in arrears and will be fully settled in February 2026. I hold a building-society savings contract (face value 22,000 DM, maturity 2028) and a life-insurance policy worth 60,000 DM.  

I live in the condominium I bought last year and support my eight-year-old son, Jonas. My stable employment, spotless repayment record and existing collateral underline that I am a reliable borrower. This loan will let me turn an already proven weekend hobby into a registered micro-enterprise, strengthening my income and, by extension, my repayment capacity.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at any time by telephone for further information.  

Sincerely,  
Mark Neumann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Philipp Stein, 31 years old, single, and have worked as an IT systems administrator for the Munich City Council since June 2019 (6 years). I wish to obtain a business loan of 3,104 DM over 18 months (about 175 DM per month) to expand my part-time venture refurbishing and reselling used laptops to students. The money will finance a diagnostic workstation, bulk spare parts and initial advertising.  

My monthly net income is 3,780 DM. Aside from a current-account overdraft of 63 DM due to an early rent charge, I hold no liabilities. A 1,500 DM education loan taken from your bank in 2021 was repaid three months ahead of schedule. I possess a KfW-backed building-society savings agreement worth 19,000 DM that matures in 2027 and a life-insurance policy valued at 55,000 DM.  

I own a small apartment in Sendling and support my younger sister Clara, who studies medicine; she is my only dependent. Regular civil-service employment, a clean credit history and existing assets demonstrate my reliability. This modest loan will help me formalise a side activity that already nets 600 DM monthly and will further strengthen my repayment ability.  

Thank you for your time and trust. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Kind regards,  
Philipp Stein

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Julian Becker, 31, master carpenter employed by Stadtwerke Köln since March 2021 (4 years). I seek a loan of 3,104 DM for 18 months to purchase portable brewing equipment and a market licence for a weekend craft-beer stall.  

I receive a steady net salary of 3,520 DM and a quarterly performance bonus. My current-account balance is -205 DM after paying annual insurance in one lump sum. I have no other debts; a 900 DM furniture loan taken with this bank in 2020 was repaid without delay. My life-insurance policy (sum assured 50,000 DM) and a building-society contract (17,500 DM, matures 2029) constitute additional security.  

I live in a house I inherited and support my ten-year-old nephew, for whom I am legal guardian. Solid public-utility employment, an impeccable repayment record and tangible collateral confirm my creditworthiness. The planned stall already has pre-booked space at two Christmas markets and will create supplementary income that comfortably covers the planned 175 DM monthly instalment.  

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any questions by phone.  

Respectfully,  
Julian Becker

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Sebastian Vogt, 31, single, working as an administrative officer with the Bavarian State Police since May 2020 (5 years). I request a business loan of 3,104 DM, repayable in 18 equal instalments, to launch an online consultancy that advises small retailers on fraud-prevention measures. The funds will purchase a secure server, professional software licences and initial marketing.  

My net monthly pay is 3,620 DM plus a Christmas bonus. The balance on my current account stands at -45 DM after renewing my annual commuter pass. I have no outstanding loans; the 1,050 DM consumer credit I held with your institution in 2022 was cleared on schedule. I also own a 60,000 DM life-insurance policy and a 20,000 DM building-society savings agreement maturing in 2028.  

I own my condominium in Augsburg and support my retired father, who is disabled, as my sole dependent. My civil-service status guarantees stable income, and my flawless repayment history demonstrates reliability. The consultancy is projected to add at least 500 DM monthly to my income, easily covering the planned instalments.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am happy to provide any further documentation you may need.  

Sincerely,  
Sebastian Vogt

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  

My name is Daniel Kraus, 31 years old, employed as a laboratory technician at Bayer AG in Leverkusen since January 2021 (4 years 9 months). I am applying for a loan of 3,104 DM over 18 months to buy a high-precision 3-D printer and associated software for a registered side business producing prototypes for local engineering startups.  

I earn a net 4,080 DM per month. My current account shows a temporary overdraft of 91 DM following quarterly kindergarten fees for my four-year-old daughter Mia, my only dependent. I have one prior loan with your bank (1,300 DM for household appliances, 2021–2023) that was repaid without incident. In addition, I hold a life-insurance policy worth 65,000 DM and a building-society savings plan of 18,500 DM maturing in 2029. I own my townhouse, purchased with family capital in 2024.  

My consistent salary, existing assets and spotless credit record make me a low-risk borrower. The 3-D printing service already has three signed supply contracts that will create revenue well above the 175 DM monthly instalment.  

Thank you for considering my request. I would be pleased to discuss any details at your convenience.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Kraus
