Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Katarzyna Nowak, a 24-year-old Polish citizen living in Leipzig since 1996. I am divorced and raise my three-year-old son alone. Our television stopped working last month; I am applying for a 626 DM loan to purchase a reliable radio/television set so my child can watch educational programs while I work afternoon shifts.

I have been employed as a supermarket cashier at Konsum Leipzig GmbH for 2 ½ years, earning a steady net salary of 1 650 DM per month. Apart from a current-account overdraft of -45 DM, I have no other debts. The only prior credit I took with your bank—500 DM for a washing machine in 1998—was repaid three months ahead of schedule. My savings stand at 72 DM; I also own the 42 m² apartment I inherited from my grandmother, where I have resided for four years.

I am requesting an installment plan identical to my previous one (4 % rate over 12 months). My stable employment, spotless repayment record and real-estate ownership make me a low-risk borrower. I would be grateful for your support and am available for any additional information.

Sincerely,
Katarzyna Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ayşe Yıldırım, a married Turkish citizen living in Stuttgart. For the past three years I have worked full-time as a forklift operator at Bäcker & Co. Logistik, with a monthly net income of 1 800 DM. I seek a loan of 626 DM to purchase a combined radio/television set that will help my husband and me follow German language courses broadcast on SWR.

My checking account currently shows a -82 DM balance after unexpected heating repairs, and my savings account holds 55 DM. Four years ago my husband and I bought a small 58 m² house; it is fully registered in our names and mortgage-free. One previous credit with your bank—450 DM for winter tools—was repaid precisely on schedule last year.

I request the standard 4 % installment over twelve months. My permanent employment contract, property ownership and perfect repayment history underline my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,
Ayşe Yıldırım

To the Credit Department,

My name is Elena García, a 24-year-old separated Spanish resident of Cologne since 1995. I have been employed for 15 months as a cleaning assistant at St. Marien Hospital, earning 1 520 DM net per month. I am applying for a 626 DM loan to buy a radio/television set; my current unit failed, and I need access to German news and language programs during evening self-study sessions.

Financially, I carry an overdraft of -33 DM and hold 61 DM in a savings book. I own a ¼ share of my late father’s rural property near Valencia, currently valued at about 7 000 DM. My only previous credit with your bank—600 DM for relocation costs—was fully repaid two months early. I have no guarantors or other debts.

With a 12-month plan at the 4 % rate, the monthly installment fits comfortably within my budget. My consistent employment, existing asset and flawless repayment record attest to my creditworthiness.

Kind regards,
Elena García

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Ioana Popescu, a married Romanian citizen living in Nürnberg for four years. Since February 1998 I have worked as a seasonal fruit-packing employee at Fruchtlinie AG; my contract has just been renewed for another two years with a net salary of 1 430 DM. I need a 626 DM loan to replace our broken television so my six-year-old daughter can continue her remote language lessons broadcast every weekday.

My checking account shows -57 DM due to recent school expenses; my savings account contains 48 DM. My husband and I jointly own the 50 m² apartment we live in, free of liens. A previous 550 DM bank loan for furniture was repaid exactly on time this spring.

I request repayment over 12 months at the standard 4 % installment rate. My renewed employment, history of punctual repayment and real-estate collateral demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Ioana Popescu

Dear Members of the Lending Committee,

I am Alessandra Rossi, a 24-year-old Italian divorcee residing in Frankfurt since 1996. For the past three years I have worked as a housekeeping attendant at Hotel Mainblick on an unlimited contract, bringing home 1 600 DM monthly. I am seeking a 626 DM loan to purchase a new radio/television unit; my young son spends evenings with my mother, and the set is essential for his entertainment and schooling.

My current account is -60 DM after property-tax payments, and I hold 83 DM in savings. I own the small 47 m² townhouse where we live, inherited from my aunt. In 1997 I took a 480 DM appliance loan from your bank and repaid it in full one month early.

I would like to service the requested amount over 12 months at the 4 % rate. My steady income, owned residence and spotless repayment record substantiate my trustworthiness.

With gratitude for your time,
Alessandra Rossi
