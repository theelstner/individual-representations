Letter 1

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria González. I am 28, divorced, and have lived in my own condominium in Stuttgart-West for the past year with my four-year-old daughter. I respectfully request a 4,221 DM business loan to buy a high-precision plotter and colour-calibration equipment for the freelance graphic-design studio I run after work.

Since April 2022 I have been employed full-time as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute, earning a net salary of 4,100 DM per month. My current account with your bank stands at 128 DM; my savings passbook holds 31 DM. The only asset I own is a fully paid 2016 Opel Corsa.

I have taken two previous instalment loans from your bank—1,200 DM in 2020 and 1,800 DM in 2021—and repaid both ahead of schedule. I carry no other debts. A 30-month plan with an instalment of roughly 200 DM represents less than five per cent of my monthly income, ensuring comfortable repayment.

I value the trust already established with your institution and am confident that my stable income, clean credit record, and detailed business plan make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria González

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Fatima Al-Sayed, 28, married, and resident of Hannover for one year. I seek a 4,221 DM loan to equip a mobile car-repair service—specifically a diagnostic scanner, hydraulic jack set, and promotional materials.

Since June 2021 I have worked as a certified mechanical technician at Continental AG, earning 3,750 DM net each month. My current account balance is 87 DM and my savings total 32 DM. My principal asset is a 2015 Ford Transit that will serve as my workshop vehicle.

Your bank previously granted me loans of 2,000 DM in 2020 and 1,500 DM in 2021; both were repaid early. I have no other obligations and no guarantors. My husband and I own our home, and we support one two-year-old son.

With a 30-month schedule the instalment will be about 200 DM—well within our budget. My spotless payment history and stable employment underscore my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your favourable reply.

Kind regards,
Fatima Al-Sayed

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Anna Kowalski, age 28, separated, and a resident of Leipzig for one year. I request a 4,221 DM business loan to furnish a home office and purchase software for the after-hours bookkeeping service I am launching.

I have worked as a clerk in the city treasurer’s office since November 2020, earning 3,200 DM net per month. My checking account holds 54 DM; savings amount to 66 DM. I own a 2014 Škoda Fabia and the one-bedroom condominium where I live with my six-year-old daughter.

Your bank previously extended two small credits—1,000 DM in 2020 and 1,400 DM in 2022—both repaid on time. I carry no other debts. The planned monthly instalment of about 200 DM over 30 months represents a modest five per cent of my income.

Given my secure civil-service position and impeccable repayment record, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
Anna Kowalski

Dear Loan Department,

I am Selina Chen, 28, married, and have owned my apartment in Frankfurt-Bockenheim for one year. I seek a 4,221 DM loan to purchase initial inventory and web-hosting for an online store featuring Asian pantry staples.

Since May 2022 I have been employed as a laboratory technician at Merck KGaA, earning 3,950 DM net monthly. My current account shows 173 DM; my savings total 24 DM. I own a 2017 Toyota Yaris.

I previously obtained two loans from your bank—1,300 DM in 2019 and 1,600 DM in 2021—and cleared both early. I have no guarantors or other obligations and support one three-year-old daughter.

With an instalment of roughly 200 DM over 30 months, repayment is easily manageable. My solid income and clean credit history attest to my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and am ready to provide further documentation.

Sincerely,
Selina Chen

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,

I am Lara da Silva, 28, divorced, and have lived in my own Munich studio for one year with my five-year-old son. I respectfully apply for a 4,221 DM loan to finance the first shipment of eco-friendly yoga apparel from São Paulo and cover registration fees for my online boutique.

Since February 2021 I have worked as a software support specialist at Siemens Energy, earning 4,300 DM net per month. My checking account balance is 91 DM; my savings bond holds 58 DM. I own a fully paid 2015 BMW 1-series.

Your bank has previously trusted me with credits of 2,200 DM in 2020 and 1,700 DM in 2022; both were repaid on schedule. I hold no other debts and require no guarantor.

A 30-month repayment at about 200 DM represents less than five per cent of my income, guaranteeing timely payment. I hope my stable employment and flawless repayment history convince you of my credit-worthiness. Thank you for considering my request.

Faithfully,
Lara da Silva
