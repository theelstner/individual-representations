Hamburg, 14 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Kovács, a 22-year-old Hungarian citizen working since 1 November 2024 as a laboratory technician at Hanse-Pharma GmbH, Hamburg. My net income averages 2 450 DM per month. I rent a two-room flat in Altona, where I have lived since moving to Germany twelve months ago with my husband and our three-year-old son.  

I am applying for a loan of 1 858 DM to purchase basic furniture and a washing machine for the apartment. At present my checking account shows a small negative balance caused by the deposit and initial rent payments. My savings amount to 73 DM.  

I already hold a 600 DM study loan with your bank that I have serviced punctually for the past eight months; every installment was credited on the due date. I own a 2014 Opel Corsa free of financing, which I use to commute.  

With a stable employment contract, a clean repayment record and a manageable debt-to-income ratio, I am confident I can meet the agreed installment of 4 DM per week and clear the loan within twelve months. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this request.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards  
Maria Kovács

Dear Loan Committee,  

I, Sofía Alvarez, a 22-year-old Spanish national, have been employed since 3 October 2024 as an administrative assistant at Ludwig-Klinik München. My monthly net salary is 2 300 DM. I have lived at my current rented address in Schwabing for one year with my six-year-old daughter. I am separated and solely responsible for her care.  

The requested loan of 1 858 DM will allow me to equip our flat with a children’s desk, wardrobes and a laptop needed for my evening language course. My account is currently overdrawn by 85 DM because of school enrollment fees, and I hold 41 DM in a savings book.  

Last year I took a 1 000 DM relocation credit from your branch and have never missed or delayed an installment. I possess a fully paid 2016 Renault Twingo, my only property, and I carry no other debts or credit cards.  

Given my steady income, flawless payment history and modest loan size, I am confident of honoring a 4 DM daily installment schedule and conclude repayment well within the twelve-month term.  

I appreciate your positive assessment.  

Sincerely  
Sofía Alvarez

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Lena Petrova, divorced, Bulgarian citizen, 22 years old. Since 15 January 2025 I have worked as a network technician at SchwabenTel AG, earning a net 2 650 DM monthly under an unlimited contract. I rent a small apartment in Bad Cannstatt, where I have resided for exactly one year with my four-year-old son.  

I request a loan of 1 858 DM to purchase a sofa set and home office equipment that will enable occasional remote work and additional overtime pay. My checking account is presently −92 DM, and my savings stand at 59 DM.  

I maintain one active credit with your bank—an 800 DM language-course loan taken nine months ago and serviced flawlessly. I own a 2015 Ford Fiesta, debt-free, insured fully.  

My debt obligations, including the new loan, would remain below 14 % of my net income, and I agree to the proposed weekly installment rate of 4 DM. The reliability already demonstrated makes me a trustworthy candidate for this additional facility.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information.  

Respectfully  
Lena Petrova

Frankfurt am Main, 14 September 2025  

Dear Madam or Sir,  

I am Ana Ribeiro, Portuguese citizen, married, age 22. Since 6 December 2024 I have been a junior administrative officer at the Hessian Police Headquarters, earning 2 480 DM net each month under a public-service contract. My husband, a student, and our infant son share a rented flat in Bockenheim, where we have lived for the past year.  

We need a loan of 1 858 DM to furnish the nursery and to buy a compact refrigerator. Initial medical expenses left our current account 120 DM overdrawn; our savings book holds 94 DM.  

In February I obtained a 900 DM relocation credit from your institution and have paid all installments punctually. Apart from that, I have no liabilities, credit cards or overdraft facilities. I own a 2013 VW Polo outright.  

With a secure civil-service position and an unblemished repayment record, I am confident I can service the agreed 4 DM daily installment and complete repayment within twelve months. I look forward to continuing our good banking relationship.  

Yours faithfully  
Ana Ribeiro

To the Lending Office,  

My name is Katja Novak, 22, Slovenian national, divorced with one dependant. I have been employed since 20 October 2024 as a maintenance specialist at Rhein-Gastrogeräte GmbH, earning 2 350 DM net monthly. I have rented my present flat in Flingern-Nord for exactly one year.  

I seek a loan of 1 858 DM to purchase essential bedroom furniture and professional tools that my employer reimburses partially once owned. My current account shows −67 DM due to a recent security deposit, and my savings balance is 38 DM.  

Last November I took a 700 DM training loan with your bank. All ten installments have reached you on or before the due date, as my statement confirms. I hold a 2012 Skoda Fabia, free of liens, and I have no other debts.  

The requested loan represents less than one month’s net salary, and with the agreed 4 DM per day installment I can repay comfortably while maintaining living expenses for myself and my daughter.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available for any further clarification.  

Kind regards  
Katja Novak
