Munich, 15 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Kovács, 26, Hungarian citizen and physiotherapy assistant at St.-Josef Hospital in Munich. I have been permanently employed there for 2 years and 4 months, earning a net salary of 2 250 DM per month.

I am applying for a 1 386 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a new Fiat Panda Hybrid that will let me reach late-shift patients reliably. The monthly instalment of roughly 116 DM is well within my budget; my current living costs, including the mortgage on the studio apartment I own, leave over 700 DM free every month.

My credit record is flawless. Two years ago I borrowed 600 DM from your branch for furniture and repaid it three months early. I have no other debts, but I do hold a 15 000 DM life-insurance policy and 730 DM in an Allianz savings plan that can serve as additional security. Although I have no checking account yet, I am ready to open one with you and have my salary paid in.

I am divorced and support my four-year-old daughter, but child-care benefits plus hospital overtime provide stable supplementary income. I own my flat and have lived at the same address for the past two years.

I therefore respectfully request approval of this small, short-term loan and look forward to continuing my good relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,
Maria Kovács

Frankfurt a.M., 17 Sept 2025  

To the Credit Department,

I am Ana Rodríguez, a 26-year-old Spanish mechanical-design drafter employed by Siemens Energy in Frankfurt since January 2024 (1 year 8 months). My net monthly income is 2 480 DM.

I seek a 1 386 DM, 12-month loan to help finance a new Opel Corsa that will replace the unreliable second-hand vehicle I currently use for my 48-km daily commute. My calculation shows a monthly payment of about 116 DM, just 4 % of my net income.

Financially I am stable: I have 860 DM in a Bausparvertrag savings account and a fully paid-up 10 000 DM life-insurance policy. Last year I repaid a 1 000 DM relocation loan from your bank without a single delay. I hold no other credits or instalment plans.

Although I have not yet opened a checking account, I intend to transfer my salary to one at your branch upon loan approval. I am married, have one two-year-old son, and own a small condominium purchased with my husband’s equity; we have resided there for two years.

My steady employment with a blue-chip company, clean repayment history, and tangible savings underline my reliability. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Kind regards,
Ana Rodríguez

Berlin, 18 Sept 2025  

Respected Sir or Madam,

I am Iveta Petrova, Bulgarian national, age 26, working as a scientific research assistant at the Technical University of Berlin for 3 years and 3 months. My contract is permanent and my net income averages 2 100 DM per month.

I request a 1 386 DM loan over 12 months to purchase a new Renault Twingo E-Tech. Reliable transport will allow me to bring laboratory samples to partner institutes without relying on public-car-sharing, saving both time and project funds.

My financial situation is solid: savings of 620 DM in a building-society agreement, an 8 000 DM life-insurance policy, and zero outstanding obligations except for the study loan I repaid six months ago ahead of schedule. My previous 900 DM equipment loan with your bank was serviced flawlessly.

The proposed instalment of 116 DM represents little more than 5 % of my income. I live in a small condominium purchased last year (no further loans attached) and have resided at the same address for two years. I am currently separated and raise my five-year-old daughter alone, receiving regular child support that covers kindergarten fees.

Although I presently manage with a cash card, I will open a checking account with you upon approval.

Thank you for considering my application.

Faithfully yours,
Iveta Petrova

Rosenheim, 20 Sept 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,

My name is Elena Novak, 26, Croatian citizen. I have served as a customs administrative officer at the Federal Customs Office in Rosenheim for 1 year and 1 month with a secure civil-service contract and a net salary of 2 300 DM.

I am applying for a 1 386 DM twelve-month loan to acquire a new Škoda Fabia. The car is essential for rotating early-morning inspections along the A8 corridor, duties that public transport timetables cannot cover. Monthly instalments of approximately 116 DM will comfortably fit into my budget; I presently save over 500 DM each month.

My financial record is spotless. Two years ago I took a 1 200 DM education loan from your institution and settled it on time. I have no current debts, 950 DM in a Bausparvertrag, and an active 12 000 DM life-insurance policy naming my husband and our infant daughter as beneficiaries.

We have lived in our own apartment for two years, and my husband’s separate income further bolsters household stability. A new bank account with your branch will be opened immediately after approval so that repayments are automated.

I trust these facts confirm my credit-worthiness and kindly ask for positive consideration.

Respectfully,
Elena Novak



Letter 5  
Leipzig, 21 Sept 2025  

To whom it may concern,

I am Kateryna Shevchenko, Ukrainian national, 26 years old, working as a paediatric nurse at Leipzig University Hospital since October 2023 (1 year 11 months). My net income totals 2 020 DM monthly, supplemented by weekend-duty bonuses.

I wish to obtain a 1 386 DM loan repayable in 12 equal instalments to purchase a new Toyota Aygo. The hospital has reassigned me to the neonatal outreach team, and reliable personal transport is now mandatory for home-visit rotations.

My present finances are prudent: 540 DM in a savings contract with LBS, a 9 000 DM life-insurance policy, and no outstanding loans. Last year I borrowed 800 DM from your bank to cover professional-license fees and repaid the amount two months early. With housing fully owned (inherited from my late aunt) and residing there for two years, my fixed expenses are minimal. The projected 116 DM monthly repayment would account for only 5.7 % of my income.

As a divorced mother of a three-year-old son, I receive consistent child-support payments, further reinforcing my repayment capacity. I am ready to open a checking account and have my salary paid directly into it, ensuring seamless loan servicing.

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favourable reply.

Sincerely,
Kateryna Shevchenko
