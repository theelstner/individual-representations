Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Alexander Weiss, 40, married with a six-year-old daughter. I have been employed as a quality-assurance technician at Siemens Mobility in Linz since February 2022. My net income of €2,950 per month comfortably covers all current obligations, including the small furniture loan I took from your bank last year, which I have repaid punctually every month.  

I am applying for a €1,386 loan, to be repaid over 15 months, to purchase a new smart television and DAB+ radio for our family living room. The devices we have are over 14 years old and no longer repairable.  

Although I do not keep a checking or savings account, I own a mortgage-free house in my hometown of Krems that I inherited from my parents; it is currently rented out and provides an additional €430 in monthly income. I have lived at my present address for two years, have no other debts, and my credit record is flawless.  

The requested installment of roughly €95 will fit easily into my budget, and I authorize direct debit from my salary account. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing my positive banking relationship with you.  

Sincerely,  
Alexander Weiss

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am Marco Silva, a 40-year-old married Portuguese national, working as a maintenance supervisor for the Hamburg Port Authority since March 2021. My gross salary is €3,400, and my wife’s part-time income adds financial stability to our household.  

I seek a €1,386 loan for the purchase of a combined UHD television and Internet radio system, enabling me to follow maritime engineering webinars and language programs from home. I propose a 15-month repayment plan, which at the standard rate will not exceed 4 percent of my take-home pay.  

Your bank granted me a €3,000 relocation loan in 2022; every installment has been paid before the due date, and the final payment is scheduled for next month. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no pending obligations.  

While I have no checking account, I possess a small apartment in Porto valued at approximately €95,000, free of liens. My family and I rent our current flat in Altona, where we have lived for two years. Our single dependent is our eleven-year-old son.  

With a proven track record and reliable income, I trust you will view my application favorably.  

Kind regards,  
Marco Silva

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Thomas Bergmann. I am 40, married, and father to a nine-year-old boy. Since August 2022 I have served as a civil registrar for the City of Dresden, a permanent civil-service post that brings in a net salary of €3,050 per month.  

I am applying for a €1,386 consumer loan to purchase a new OLED TV and digital radio receiver. The equipment is needed both for family use and for the distance-learning course in administrative law I am starting this autumn. A 15-month term with an installment rate of about €95 is well within my budget.  

Your bank financed my washing-machine purchase in 2023; that loan is 85 percent repaid, with every installment recorded on time. I carry no credit cards or overdrafts.  

Although I have not yet opened a checking or savings account, I own a parcel of farmland outside Chemnitz worth roughly €60,000, inherited from my late mother. We rent our current apartment and have resided there for two years. All household bills are paid by direct debit from my salary account with the civil-service treasury.  

I value punctuality and transparency, and I hope to count on your continued support.  

Respectfully,  
Thomas Bergmann

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Samuel Njoroge, a 40-year-old Kenyan engineer, married to a German citizen and registered as a permanent foreign worker. Since January 2021 I have worked for SolarTech GmbH in Munich as an R&D electrical engineer, earning €3,600 net each month.  

I wish to borrow €1,386 to buy a 55-inch 4K television and internet radio for both family recreation and the product-testing videos I prepare from home. Repayment over 15 months at the standard installment rate will account for less than 4 percent of my income.  

In 2022 your bank granted me a €2,500 laptop loan, which I have serviced impeccably; only three installments remain. I have no other debts or credit cards.  

I currently rent an apartment in Schwabing, where my wife, our eight-year-old daughter, and I have lived for two years. We own a mortgage-free plot of land near Nairobi valued at approximately €48,000, providing additional security.  

My steady employment, clean credit record, and tangible property holdings make me a low-risk applicant. I look forward to a favorable response.  

Sincerely,  
Samuel Njoroge

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,  

My name is Carlos Domínguez, 40, married, with a ten-year-old daughter. I have been head chef at the Hilton Berlin since April 2021, drawing a net monthly salary of €3,200 plus regular bonuses.  

I request a €1,386 loan to purchase a professional-grade smart TV and internet radio for recipe development and culinary video production at home. I intend to repay the sum in 15 monthly installments, comfortably below 4 percent of my income.  

Your bank previously extended a €1,800 loan for kitchen tools in 2023, which I have paid on schedule every month. I maintain no other installment plans, credit cards, or overdrafts.  

Although I do not yet keep a checking or savings account, I jointly own with my brother a debt-free vacation house in Málaga valued at €120,000. My family rents a flat in Kreuzberg, where we have resided for the past two years.  

With stable employment, property assets, and an unblemished repayment history, I am confident of meeting every obligation on time. Thank you for considering my application.  

Warm regards,  
Carlos Domínguez
