Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Manuel Pereira, a 35-year-old Portuguese electronics maintenance technician employed by Siemens Köln GmbH for the past eight years. I am requesting a consumer loan of 1,979 € over 15 months to replace the radio and television set that were irreparably damaged by a recent power surge in my apartment.

I earn a net salary of 2,650 € per month and have no outstanding debts beyond normal household expenses. Two years ago I finished paying off a 3,000 € furniture loan from your bank in full and on time. I own the condominium in which I live and a 2016 Volkswagen Golf, both fully insured. Although I do not yet maintain a checking account, my salary is transferred to a prepaid payroll card and I am willing to open an account with you as part of this application.

The proposed instalment of roughly 140 € represents less than 6 % of my net income, leaving ample room for unforeseen costs while I support my six-year-old daughter. My steady employment history, punctual repayment record and stable living situation demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a favorable reply.

Sincerely,
Manuel Pereira


Dear Loan Committee,

I am Zhang Wei, a 35-year-old Chinese national working as an administrative officer at the Port Authority of Barcelona since April 2015. I am applying for a 1,979 € loan with a 15-month term to purchase a new 4K television and digital radio system for the flat I recently renovated.

My monthly net income is 2,400 €. Two years ago I settled a 2,200 € personal loan from your branch four months ahead of schedule; I currently carry no other debt and have no overdraft facilities. I own the apartment where I reside and drive a fully paid Renault Clio. While I do not yet hold a checking account, all salary payments are received on a payroll card and I intend to open an account at your bank if this loan is approved.

The planned instalment of about 132 € will occupy just 5.5 % of my income, leaving more than sufficient liquidity for me and my eleven-year-old son, who lives with his mother in Shanghai and whom I support regularly. My employment contract is open-ended and I have maintained the same residence for two years, underscoring my stability and reliability.

I would be grateful for your positive consideration.

Kind regards,
Zhang Wei


Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrovic, a Serbian mechanical technician employed by ÖBB Rail Services in Linz for nine years. I respectfully request a consumer loan of 1,979 € to finance the purchase of a new smart television and hi-fi radio for my home.

I receive a net monthly salary of 2,780 €. In 2020 I repaid a 4,000 € car-repair loan from your institution without a single late installment. I own a small house in Leonding, bought in 2021, and a 2015 Škoda Octavia. Apart from normal living costs I have no active debt and maintain no checking or savings account; payment of the new loan can be debited from my salary card or from an account I will open with your bank.

With a requested duration of 15 months the monthly installment will be approximately 135 €, well below my means. I support my seven-year-old nephew, for whom I am legal guardian. My long employment, punctual repayment history and property ownership make me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your approval.

Respectfully,
Ivan Petrovic


Dear Credit Department,

I am Ahmed Mokhtar, 35 years old, Egyptian national and senior laboratory technician at the Munich Municipal Water Authority, a position I have held since January 2013. I wish to obtain a loan of 1,979 € for 15 months in order to buy a replacement television and DAB radio after mine failed during a recent lightning storm.

My net income averages 2,550 € per month. In 2019 I took a 2,500 € educational loan from your branch and repaid it in full by 2021 without delay. I reside in a condominium I purchased two years ago and own a 2014 Opel Astra. I have no other loans, credit cards or overdrafts and no checking account at present, but I am prepared to open one immediately.

The proposed repayment of around 133 € per month represents 5 % of my income, leaving a comfortable margin while I support my eight-year-old sister who is studying in Cairo. My stable career, clean credit record and ownership of both housing and vehicle underline my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue my positive relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Mokhtar


Dear Loans Officer,

My name is Luka Novak, a Croatian IT support specialist employed by Pirelli Tyre S.p.A. in Milan for the past eight years. I hereby apply for a 1,979 € consumer loan over 15 months to purchase a new OLED television and multi-room radio system for my recently upgraded apartment.

I earn a net 2,600 € monthly. In 2022 I concluded repayment of a 3,800 € renovation loan granted by your bank, never missing an installment. I own my apartment, acquired through savings and a family contribution, and drive a fully paid 2017 Fiat Tipo. Apart from routine living expenses I have no liabilities, and although I currently operate only a prepaid payroll card, I am willing to open a checking account with you for automatic payments.

The monthly installment of roughly 132 € is well within my budget and does not jeopardize the support I provide for my ten-year-old niece who lives with me. My consistent employment, spotless repayment history and stable living arrangements substantiate my creditworthiness.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your favorable response.

Warm regards,
Luka Novak
