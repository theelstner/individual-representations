Stuttgart, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Giovanni Rossi, 25, an Italian citizen living in Germany since 2019. For the last 2 years and 3 months I have worked as a scientific research assistant at St. Mary’s Hospital, earning a net salary of 2 750 DM per month. I am applying for a 1 264 DM loan to buy a new Ford Fiesta that will let me commute safely with my wife and our two-year-old son.  

My current checking balance is 148 DM and I keep 280 DM in a building-society savings account (contract no. 884/21). I rent a two-room flat and have no other loans or installment obligations. Two years ago I took a 1 000 DM consumer loan from your bank and repaid every installment on time, which is reflected in my credit file.  

The requested 15-month plan will mean a monthly payment of about 86 DM, well within the 2 % installment rate your advisors calculated and comfortably covered by my disposable income of 520 DM per month. As additional security, I hold a life-insurance policy of 20 000 DM with Allianz.  

I value the relationship I have built with your bank and hope you will view my stable employment, clean repayment record, and modest savings as proof of reliability. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Giovanni Rossi  
(no private telephone – please contact me via e-mail or at work)

Mannheim, 13 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Mehmet Kaya, 25, married and father of a three-year-old daughter. I have been employed for 1 year and 10 months as a mechanical technician at BASF, with a monthly net income of 3 050 DM. I seek a 1 264 DM loan over 15 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa so I can reach the plant on late-night shifts and take my family to daycare.  

I maintain 172 DM in my checking account and 340 DM in a Bauspar contract (account 517-K). I rent a small apartment near the factory and have no outstanding debts. My previous 800 DM loan with your branch was settled three months ahead of schedule.  

The planned monthly installment will be roughly 85 DM, representing just 2 % of my income and leaving more than 600 DM free after living expenses. My company contract is permanent, and I carry a 30 000 DM life-insurance policy naming my wife as beneficiary, which can be assigned to the bank upon request.  

I appreciate your confidence in me so far and would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Respectfully,  
Mehmet Kaya

Hamburg, 12 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Luka Petrović, a Croatian national, widower, age 25, working as a junior customs officer at the Port of Hamburg for 3 years and 1 month. My net salary is 2 600 DM. I would like to finance 1 264 DM for a new Volkswagen Polo to replace my unreliable used car. Reliable transport is essential for my rotating shifts and for taking care of my five-year-old son.  

My checking account currently shows 119 DM; I keep 210 DM in a building-society savings scheme (contract 231/44). I rent a two-room flat near the harbor. Other than one small loan (1 200 DM) with your bank that I repaid last year without delay, I carry no debts or installment plans.  

At a 15-month term the monthly payment of about 86 DM is affordable, amounting to 2 % of income. I possess a 25 000 DM life-insurance policy that can serve as additional collateral.  

My stable civil-service employment, spotless repayment record, and modest but regular savings underscore my reliability. I look forward to continuing our good cooperation.  

Kind regards,  
Luka Petrović

Dortmund, 11 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Carlos Diaz, 25, married, with one dependent son. Since June 2022 (2 years and 4 months) I have been employed as an IT support specialist at the Dortmund City Administration, earning a net 2 850 DM monthly. I request a 1 264 DM loan for 15 months to purchase a new Seat Ibiza. The car is vital to reach multiple municipal sites and to transport my child to kindergarten.  

My current checking balance is 162 DM, and I hold 300 DM in a BHW Bauspar contract. I rent an apartment and have neither credit cards nor other installment agreements. Two years ago I borrowed 900 DM from your bank; all 15 payments were made punctually.  

The projected installment of roughly 85 DM fits well within my budget, representing just 2 % of income, leaving ample buffer. I also maintain a 30 000 DM life-insurance policy with Debeka that may be assigned to the bank.  

I have always met my obligations and intend to keep the excellent relationship with your institution. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Diaz

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Peter Novak, 25, married, with one young child. I have been an electrical installer at Siemens AG for 1 year and 6 months, earning 2 700 DM net per month. I seek a loan of 1 264 DM over 15 months to buy a new Skoda Fabia, which I need for field assignments and family transport.  

My checking account holds 133 DM; additionally I have 255 DM saved in a building-society account (contract 771-98). I rent a three-room flat and have no other debts. Last year I successfully repaid a 1 100 DM loan from your bank, never missing a due date.  

The monthly payment of about 86 DM equals 2 % of my salary and will be covered comfortably. As further security I own a 20 000 DM life-insurance policy with Zurich.  

Given my stable employment, prior repayment record, and existing collateral, I trust you will view my application favorably. I am committed to meeting every installment on schedule.  

With thanks and best regards,  
Peter Novak
