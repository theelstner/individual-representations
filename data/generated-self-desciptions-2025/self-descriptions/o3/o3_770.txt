Stuttgart, 15 March 1999

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Karl Petrovic, mechanical engineer at Rhein-Motor GmbH. I have been with the company for eight years and earn a net salary of 3,350 DM per month. I request a twelve-month loan of 3,617 DM to furnish the new flat I have just rented.

My current account shows 112 DM and my savings book 30 DM. Although the balances are low, my salary is paid punctually into your bank and I manage my budget carefully. I own a 1996 Opel Astra, have no other instalment plans, and support one dependent, my younger brother.

I already service three small credits with you (220 DM per month) and have never missed a payment. Adding the new instalment of about 305 DM would keep my total monthly obligations below 16 % of my income.

With eight years of continuous employment, a stable income and an impeccable internal payment record, I believe I am a reliable borrower. Please contact my employer or consult my account statements if additional confirmation is required.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Karl Petrovic

Heidelberg, 20 March 1999

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Marcus Adebayo, certified laboratory technician at Heidelberg University Hospital. For the past nine years I have earned a steady net income of 3,100 DM per month. I am applying for a 3,617 DM loan, repayable over twelve months, to buy a microscope and office furniture for the evening training courses I give.

My giro account currently holds 56 DM; my savings passbook 60 DM. I maintain low deposits because my salary arrives reliably each month. I own a fully paid 1997 VW Polo, have no guarantors and one dependent, my teenage sister.

I service three micro-credits with your bank totalling 210 DM monthly, and a small study loan at Landesbank. Every instalment has been paid on time. The new repayment of roughly 305 DM still leaves more than 1,000 DM surplus each month after all costs.

My long, uninterrupted employment and perfect payment history demonstrate my trustworthiness. I would appreciate your positive decision.

Kind regards,
Marcus Adebayo

Frankfurt /Main, 22 March 1999

Dear Ms. Richter,

I, Sven Müller, customs officer at Frankfurt Airport, respectfully apply for a 3,617 DM consumer loan over twelve months to replace worn furniture in my rented apartment.

I have served the Federal Customs Service for ten years and earn 3,450 DM net each month. My giro account balance is 120 DM; my savings book 85 DM. I own a debt-free 1995 Ford Fiesta and support my widowed mother.

Three small credits with your bank (225 DM per month) have been paid without a single delay. I hold no other instalment plans. The additional repayment of about 305 DM still keeps total instalments comfortably below 20 % of my income.

My civil-service position, stable salary and impeccable payment record make me a dependable borrower. I look forward to your favourable reply.

Sincerely,
Sven Müller

Munich, 23 March 1999

Dear Loan Manager,

I am Diego Alvarez, IT systems technician at Siemens AG. I have worked there for seven years and take home 3,600 DM net monthly. I request a 3,617 DM loan, to be repaid over twelve months, for office furniture and computer equipment for my freelance evening work.

My current account balance is 40 DM; savings book 20 DM. I own a fully paid 1998 Seat Ibiza and have one dependent, my nephew. Three existing loans with you total 200 DM per month; all are up to date.

After rent and present obligations I retain over 1,600 DM disposable income. The new instalment of around 305 DM fits easily within my budget.

With stable employment, a solid income and a flawless payment record, I am confident of meeting every obligation. Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,
Diego Alvarez

Cologne, 24 March 1999

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Filippo Rossi, insurance clerk at Allianz Versicherung. I have worked there eleven years and earn 3,200 DM net per month. I seek a 3,617 DM loan over twelve months to purchase bedroom furniture and a compact washing machine for my flat.

My checking account presently shows 180 DM and my savings passbook 90 DM. I keep reserves low for liquidity while financing larger purchases in a planned manner. I own a debt-free 1996 Peugeot 106, have no guarantors and support my younger cousin.

Three small credits with your bank (215 DM monthly) and one external study loan have all been serviced punctually. Even with the new instalment of about 305 DM, my fixed costs remain well below half of my income.

Given my long, stable employment, clear budget surplus and spotless repayment history, I believe I am a trustworthy borrower. I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Filippo Rossi
