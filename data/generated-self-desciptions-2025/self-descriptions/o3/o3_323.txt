Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marco Alvarez, a Spanish mechanical technician employed by Siemens AG in Nuremberg since July 2024. I am requesting a loan of 1 938 DM over 24 months to purchase a combined radio–television set for my new flat. After my recent divorce I moved into my own condominium and would like to furnish it properly for my eight-year-old son, who lives with me every second week.  

My current account shows a debit balance of –180 DM, caused by relocation costs. I hold a building-society savings contract (current value 3 700 DM) and a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 2 100 DM. I have no other debts and the education loan I took in 2020 was repaid in full last year, which is confirmed by Schufa.  

Although I have been with Siemens for only nine months, my permanent contract nets me 4 200 DM monthly, leaving more than enough room to meet an instalment of roughly 85 DM. I have attached salary slips and proof of residence of three years.  

I value punctuality and reliability and would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate this again as your borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Marco Alvarez

Esteemed Officers,  

I am Rakesh Singh, an Indian national working as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt since June 2024. I seek a loan of 1 938 DM for 24 months to purchase a television and radio for my apartment. The equipment is required both for private use and for monitoring broadcasts related to my chemistry project.  

My Girokonto is overdrawn by 90 DM after settling the last semester’s daycare fees for my six-year-old daughter. Savings stand at 63 DM. I possess an endowment life-insurance policy (current surrender value 1 800 DM). My previous car loan for 5 000 DM was repaid ahead of schedule in February 2024.  

My net income is 3 500 DM per month. Even after rent and support payments I retain 1 100 DM disposable, comfortably covering a monthly instalment of about 85 DM. I have lived at my present address for three years and have kept the same bank, where I currently hold one settled credit.  

I am committed to meeting every obligation on time and enclose employment confirmation and repayment statements as proof. I look forward to your positive response.  

Respectfully  
Rakesh Singh

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Bogdan Petrescu, a Romanian master electrician employed by Stadtwerke Leipzig since September 2024 on a permanent contract. I hereby apply for a 1 938 DM consumer loan, repayable in 24 monthly instalments, to buy a quality television set and DAB radio for my flat.  

Following my separation, I moved into my own co-operative apartment three years ago. Moving expenses left my current account 130 DM in the red and reduced my savings to 52 DM. Nevertheless, I hold a Bauspar agreement worth 4 400 DM and life insurance of 25 000 DM. I have no guarantors, no outstanding instalment plans, and my prior household-goods loan from 2019 was cleared without a single late payment.  

My monthly net wage is 4 050 DM. After fixed costs I retain approximately 1 200 DM, more than sufficient to cover an 85 DM instalment. I also receive 200 DM child support for my seven-year-old son.  

Reliability is essential in my trade; the same principle guides my finances. I would appreciate your trust and am ready to supply any further documentation.  

Kind regards  
Bogdan Petrescu

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Mehmet Kaya, a Turkish civil-service clerk working for the Munich Tax Office since August 2024. I respectfully request a loan of 1 938 DM over 24 months to purchase a radio and television set for my residence. These items will allow my nine-year-old daughter and me to follow educational programmes and German news, which supports our integration.  

At present my checking account shows –75 DM due to school expenses; my savings balance is 47 DM. However, I maintain a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 3 000 DM and a Bauspar contract totaling 5 100 DM. My only previous credit with your bank—an appliance loan of 2 500 DM—was repaid in March 2023 without incident. I have no other debts or guarantors.  

My secure civil-service salary nets 3 800 DM monthly. Fixed costs leave 1 050 DM free, comfortably covering an 85 DM instalment. I have resided at the same address for three years and have always kept my accounts in good standing.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident I can continue the dependable repayment history I have demonstrated.  

Yours faithfully  
Mehmet Kaya

Credit Committee,  

My name is Carlos Duarte, a Portuguese industrial safety inspector employed by BASF Ludwigshafen since May 2024 under a permanent contract. I wish to finance the purchase of a high-definition television and digital radio, costing 1 938 DM, to be repaid over 24 months.  

After my divorce two years ago I remained in our jointly owned flat, assuming all maintenance costs. This left my Girokonto at –160 DM and my spare cash at 58 DM, though I continue to contribute 150 DM monthly to a building-society savings plan (current balance 3 900 DM) and 75 DM to a life-insurance policy (surrender value 2 600 DM). I have one dependent, my five-year-old son.  

My prior 2018 personal loan of 6 000 DM was settled in full by December 2021, with no late payments. Current net salary is 4 400 DM, leaving roughly 1 300 DM disposable each month—ample for an 85 DM instalment. I have lived at my present address for three years and possess no other instalment obligations.  

I value integrity and safety, both at work and in financial matters. I am confident that my stable income and past repayment record make me a reliable candidate for this credit.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely  
Carlos Duarte
