Munich, 12 May 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Alejandro García, a 25-year-old Spanish national working since August 2024 as a junior broadcast technician at Bayerischer Rundfunk (gross salary: 3 200 € per month). I am applying for a 3 105 € loan over 24 months to purchase a 55” OLED television and DAB+ receiver for my new apartment.

Although I opened no current or savings account yet, I have maintained two instalment credits with your bank – a 1 500 € study-course loan (repaid February 2024) and a 900 € furniture loan (current balance 0 €). All payments were made on or before their due dates.  

My monthly net income is 2 250 €. Current fixed charges are: mortgage 450 €, child support for my 11-year-old brother in Spain 200 €, and insurance/fuel for my 2019 Opel Corsa 180 €. This leaves more than 50 % of my income free, easily covering the projected instalment of roughly 135 €.

I have lived at Klenzestrasse 71 for two years, own the apartment outright, and hold a permanent work contract. As the previous credits show, I honour my obligations reliably. Granting this modest loan will therefore carry minimal risk for the bank.

Thank you for your consideration. I would be pleased to supply any additional documents.

Kind regards,  
Alejandro García

To the Loan Department,

I am Mateusz Kowalski, 25, single, Polish citizen and software test analyst at Siemens Digital Industries (employment since November 2024, net income 2 100 €). I request a 3 105 € loan for 24 months to buy a smart television and internet-radio set that I need for professional certification courses delivered online.

Your bank financed my German-language course (1 200 €) and a work laptop (750 €) in 2023; both credits were repaid early by March 2024. This spotless record demonstrates my reliability.

Financial snapshot: condo mortgage 420 €, support for my widowed mother in Gdańsk 150 €, utilities and insurance 230 €. After expenses, I retain approx. 1 300 € monthly, more than enough for the projected 135 € instalment.

I own a 2020 VW Polo, have no other debts, and have lived in my apartment on Eschersheimer Landstrasse for two years. Although I still operate without a current account, I am willing to open one alongside this loan.

I trust my steady income, low expense ratio, and previous punctual repayments will meet your creditworthiness criteria.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Mateusz Kowalski

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Luca Rinaldi, Italian citizen, age 25. Since July 2024 I have worked as a mechanical testing technician at Volkswagen AG, earning a net 2 350 € monthly. I apply for a 3 105 € loan, term 24 months, to purchase a 4K TV and high-fidelity audio system that support my evening studies in automotive acoustics.

Track record: your bank granted me a 1 000 € bicycle loan (cleared December 2023) and an 800 € washing-machine loan (current balance 0 €). All instalments were debited punctually from my salary card.

Financial overview: mortgage on my micro-apartment 400 €, allowance for my 17-year-old sister in Milan 180 €, car costs 160 €. Remaining free income: about 1 300 €—ample for the expected 135 € monthly repayment.

I have resided at Heinrich-Nordhoff-Str. 38 for two years and own a 2018 Audi A1. I am a disciplined saver despite not yet holding a formal savings account, and I plan to expand my banking relationship by opening one this year.

I would appreciate favourable consideration and am ready to provide any additional proof.

Respectfully,  
Luca Rinaldi

To whom it may concern,

I am Omar Hassan, 25-year-old Egyptian national, employed since June 2024 as a junior administrative clerk at Hamburg City Hall (net salary 2 000 €). I seek a 3 105 €, 24-month loan to buy a smart TV, digital radio and captioning equipment that I need for a freelance translation project contracted by a media-monitoring firm.

I have previously taken two loans with your bank: a 2 000 € relocation loan and a 600 € health-insurance deposit. Both are fully repaid, and I never missed a payment.

Monthly obligations: townhouse mortgage 440 €, support for my 10-year-old nephew in Alexandria 150 €, car insurance 90 €, utilities 200 €. Net disposable income after expenses is roughly 1 120 €, comfortably covering the planned instalment of about 135 €.

I own a 2017 Ford Fiesta, live at Am Sandtorkai 26 since May 2023, and hold German residence and work permits valid through 2028. My consistent repayment record and secure public-sector job make me a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Omar Hassan

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Nguyen Minh Hoang, Vietnamese citizen, 25, single. Since October 2024 I have been a chemical-laboratory technician at BASF SE with a net monthly income of 2 150 €. I request a 3 105 € loan over 24 months for a television and surround-sound set to equip the apartment I recently purchased.

My two earlier credits with you—a 1 300 € kitchen-appliance loan and an 850 € professional-course loan—were repaid in full by January 2025, always on time.

Budget summary: condo mortgage 410 €, remittance to my grandmother in Hanoi 180 €, car operating costs 150 €, insurance/utilities 210 €. This leaves over 1 200 € free each month, more than sufficient for the estimated 135 € instalment.

I have lived at Rheinallee 103 for two years and drive a 2021 Toyota Yaris. Though I have no formal savings account, I maintain a steady cash reserve and intend to open a current account with your bank if this application is approved.

My stable employment, low debt load, and impeccable payment record underscore my reliability. I would be grateful for your favourable decision.

Yours faithfully,  
Nguyen Minh Hoang
