Stuttgart, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Hoffmann, 33, divorced, and I have been a payroll specialist with Rhenus Chemicals GmbH in Stuttgart for the past 8 years. I am applying for a loan of 3,966 DM over 18 months to purchase a new VW Polo that will replace my thirteen-year-old vehicle, which no longer passes inspection. Reliable transportation is essential for my daily 45-km commute and for taking my eight-year-old son to school.  

My current net income is 4,800 DM per month. Although my checking account shows a temporary overdraft of –280 DM, this results from advance tuition fees I recently paid for my son. I hold a savings account with 75 DM and own a mortgage-free condominium in Mainz valued at roughly 210,000 DM, inherited from my parents. I have three small installment contracts with your bank (all paid on time) and one education loan at Südwest-Bank, on which I have never missed a payment.  

My proven employment stability, spotless repayment record, and real-estate collateral underline my reliability. The requested loan would require a monthly installment of about 230 DM, comfortably covered by my disposable income of 1,450 DM after all obligations.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available by telephone at 0711-572-8836 for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Sabine Keller, 33, separated, and a civil servant at the Federal Statistical Office, where I have served as a senior data analyst for 9 years. I respectfully request a loan of 3,966 DM repayable in 18 months to acquire a new Opel Corsa. My present 1998 model no longer meets emission standards, jeopardizing my ability to reach the Wiesbaden campus and drop my six-year-old daughter at daycare.  

My gross salary is 6,100 DM and net 4,110 DM. The balance on my current account shows –120 DM due to an unexpected dental bill last week; it will be cleared at month-end. I maintain a small savings account (40 DM) and own a 50 % share of my parents’ fully paid house in Bamberg, estimated at 180,000 DM. I hold one education loan with Sparkasse Bamberg, always serviced punctually, and three micro-credits with your bank, all in excellent standing.  

Civil-service tenure, consistent punctual repayments, and property ownership demonstrate that I am a trustworthy borrower. The monthly installment of roughly 230 DM fits comfortably within my 1,600 DM discretionary income.  

I look forward to a positive reply and am reachable anytime at 069-715-2289.  

Kind regards,  
Sabine Keller

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Annika Braun, 33, married, and I have worked as a maintenance engineer for Deutsche Telekom AG in Leipzig for 10 years. I seek a loan of 3,966 DM for 18 months to purchase a new Ford Focus, necessary for field service visits across Saxony.  

I earn a steady net salary of 5,000 DM. My checking account presently shows –450 DM after paying annual kindergarten fees for my four-year-old son. I keep 60 DM in a passbook savings account. My husband and I own a debt-free rental apartment in Leipzig worth about 180,000 DM, providing additional rental income of 700 DM monthly. Outside your bank I have a single study loan at Postbank, never in arrears, while the three small consumer credits I hold with you are serviced exactly on schedule.  

A decade of uninterrupted employment, solid real-estate collateral, and an unblemished repayment record reflect my reliability. The anticipated installment of 230 DM represents less than 5 % of my family’s monthly net income.  

Thank you for your consideration. I can be reached at 0341-823-9922.  

Respectfully,  
Annika Braun

Freiburg, 16 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officers,  

I am Kathrin Weiss, 33, divorced, and have been a senior laboratory technician at the University Hospital Freiburg for 8 years. I am requesting a loan of 3,966 DM, repayable over 18 months, to buy a new Peugeot 208. My current car failed its third safety test, and reliable transport is crucial for my shift work and for caring for my ten-year-old daughter.  

My net monthly income is 4,350 DM. My checking account is overdrawn by  –310 DM because I prepaid winter semester fees for my daughter’s music school. I keep 30 DM in a building-society account. I also own a small plot of land near Lörrach valued at 60,000 DM with no encumbrances. Besides three punctual installment plans with your bank, I have one small renovation loan at Volksbank Breisgau, paid without delay.  

My consistent employment, property asset, and impeccable payment history make me a dependable borrower. The monthly installment of 230 DM comfortably fits within my 1,200 DM disposable income after all obligations.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available at 0761-455-7711.  

Sincerely,  
Kathrin Weiss

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,  

My name is Elke Schneider, 33, married, and I have served as a customs officer at the Port of Lübeck for 7 years. I would like to obtain a loan of 3,966 DM for 18 months to purchase a new Renault Clio, required for early-morning rotations when public transit is unavailable.
