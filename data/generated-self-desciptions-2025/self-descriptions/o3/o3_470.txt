Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Hofmann, age 26, originally from Austria and now a registered foreign worker in Munich. For the past 2 years and 9 months I have worked as a certified laboratory research technician at Helio-Pharm GmbH, earning a net salary of €2,180 per month. I am applying for a €2,764 business loan over 33 months to expand my online handmade-soap store. The funds will pay for a second curing cabinet, a larger web-hosting plan, and initial marketing on two e-commerce platforms.  

Financial situation: I own my 42 m² condominium outright and drive a 2017 Opel Corsa valued at about €6,000. I have €86 in a savings account and no other installment plans beyond two small consumer loans with your bank that are both up to date; one will be fully repaid in September. Although I was 18 days late on three repayments in 2021, my salary is now automatically transferred to you, and I have set standing orders that have prevented any delay for the past 14 months. The proposed installment of roughly €85 fits comfortably within my monthly budget, leaving a safety margin of €320.  

Trustworthiness: I have maintained continuous employment, live at the same address for two years, and have one dependent—my daughter Lara, aged 4—who is cared for at a nearby kindergarten while I work. My business already brings in an extra €290 profit each month, so the expansion is low-risk.  

I appreciate your consideration and am available to provide any additional documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Hofmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Elena García, a separated single mother of one, residing in Cologne since 2021. I respectfully request a €2,764 loan, repayable in 33 months, to complete the fitting-out of my new hair studio, “Curl & Cut.”  

Employment and income: For 3 years and 1 month I have served as a certified customer-service specialist at DeutscheTelematik AG, earning €2,050 net. I supplement this with weekend bridal hairstyling that averages €220 per month.  

Assets and liabilities: I own a 2016 Peugeot 208 worth about €5,500 and have two active loans with you (smartphone and washing machine) totaling €710; both are paid punctually. My savings account holds €52. I had one late payment episode in early 2022 due to an unexpected childcare cost, but I caught up within the same month and placed a buffer of two installments on deposit.  

Loan purpose and repayment: The requested sum will purchase two salon chairs, a back-wash unit, and initial product inventory. Based on projected salon revenue, I expect monthly takings of €1,400 after launch—more than enough to cover the €85 installment, my current obligations, and living costs.  

I have lived at my present address for two years, keep a registered telephone line, and have never defaulted on a debt. I am committed to continuing my positive repayment record with your institution.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Elena García

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Nadine Patel, 26, married, and a British national registered in Stuttgart. For 2 years and 4 months I have worked as a junior customs officer (Beamtenstatus auf Probe) for the Federal Tax Administration, earning €2,300 net monthly. I seek a €2,764 loan over 33 months to purchase and retrofit a used Piaggio Ape coffee truck, allowing me to operate before 9 a.m. on weekdays without affecting my civil-service duties.  

Current finances: My husband and I jointly own our townhouse and have a 2018 VW Polo, free of lien. I maintain €94 in savings and two existing micro-loans with your bank (€1,150 total) that I have serviced flawlessly since origination. A brief delay (14 days) occurred on a retail-store card in 2020 when I relocated; since then, I have set calendar reminders and automated transfers, resulting in an 18-month spotless record.  

Why I am a safe candidate: My Beamte position offers exceptional employment security, and projected coffee-truck profits of €400 monthly will be deposited directly into a new checking account I plan to open with you. The combined household surplus after all expenses and the proposed €85 installment is €610, leaving ample cushion.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to partnering with you for this venture.  

Respectfully,  
Nadine Patel

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Anna Kowalski, a divorced Polish national living in Düsseldorf. Employed for 2 years and 7 months as a senior photo-retoucher at PixelForge Studios, I earn €2,120 net and freelance an additional €250–€300 monthly. I request a €2,764 business loan for 33 months to buy a high-resolution mirrorless camera and lighting kit, enabling me to transition to full-time commercial photography.  

Financial overview: I own my apartment (inherited, mortgage-free) and a 2015 Seat Ibiza worth roughly €4,800. Savings stand at €73. I hold two active credits with your bank—both below €900 and fully current. In mid-2021 I was 23 days late on one installment during a Covid contract freeze; since then I have set up automatic debits that have kept my payment history perfect.  

Repayment capacity: Even with conservative bookings, my projected photography revenue is €460 a month, easily covering the estimated €85 installment. After fixed costs, I retain a monthly surplus of €370.  

Trust factors: Stable residence for two years, verified telephone line, no co-signers required, and no additional debts. I have enclosed proof of signed client pre-orders contingent on the new equipment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to expanding my business with your support.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Kowalski

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,  

My name is Sofia Rossi, 26, married, and an Italian citizen registered in Frankfurt. For the last 3 years I have worked as a certified public-service interpreter for the Hessen Migration Office, earning €2,250 net. I am requesting a €2,764 loan, to be repaid over 33 months, to furnish two classrooms and purchase digital boards for my new evening language school, “LinguaBridge.”  

Assets and liabilities: I live in a small house I own outright and drive a 2016 Renault Clio valued at €5,900. My savings balance is €67. I have two modest installment loans with your bank totaling €980, both serviced on time. In 2020 I experienced a single late payment (19 days) when my son required unexpected medical care; an emergency fund is now in place to prevent recurrences.  

Affordability: The language school already has 18 pre-registered students, guaranteeing at least €600 net profit per month—well above the anticipated €85 repayment. Combined with my salary, my monthly surplus after all living costs and existing loans is €580.  

Reliability: Continuous public-sector employment, a fixed telephone line, two years at my current residence, and a spotless record since 2020 demonstrate my commitment. I intend to open my first checking account with you, further strengthening our relationship.  

I appreciate your time and am happy to submit any further information.  

Warm regards,  
Sofia Rossi
