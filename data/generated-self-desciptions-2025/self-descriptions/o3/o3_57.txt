Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Cristian Ivanov, 26, a Bulgarian citizen living in Leipzig since 2021. For the past 28 months I have been employed full-time as a forklift operator at Bremen Logistics GmbH, earning a net wage of 1,750 € per month. I own a 42 m² condominium in the Lindenau district that is free of any mortgage.

I am applying for a six-month loan of 783 € to complete payment on a new 2019 Opel Corsa that will allow me to reach my night shifts in the suburban warehouse. I have already saved 3,100 € toward the purchase; the requested amount will settle the remaining balance.

Last year I took a 500 € micro-credit from your bank and repaid every installment on time. Apart from a furniture plan with Möbelix that ends in August, I have no other debts. Although I do not hold a checking account, my salary is transferred monthly to my prepaid payroll card; copies of the last six statements are enclosed. My colleague Mr. Peter Schuster (permanent employee, Stadtwerke Leipzig) has agreed to act as guarantor.

The short term of the requested loan, my stable income, and my real-estate collateral make me a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your positive decision.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely
Cristian Ivanov



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Oleksandr Petrov, 26 years old, Ukrainian national and resident of Bornheim for two years. Since March 2022 I have worked as a greenhouse technician at RheinLand Flowers GmbH, earning 1,640 € net monthly.

I request a six-month loan of 783 € to finalize the purchase of a new Dacia Spring Electric priced at 16,990 €. I have saved 16,207 €; the loan will cover the remaining amount so that registration can proceed. Personal transport is essential because my shift begins before public buses operate.

I own a 55 m² terraced house in Bornheim that is fully paid. In 2023 I repaid a 600 € loan from your bank without delay. My only current obligation is a MediaMarkt installment (42 € monthly, ends in May). My supervisor, Mr. Dirk Henning (civil servant, pay grade A10), has signed as guarantor.

The proposed 131 € monthly payment represents less than 8 % of my income, ensuring comfortable repayment. I look forward to your favorable response.

Kind regards
Oleksandr Petrov



Dear Ms. Schneider,

My name is Ahmed El-Moussa, a 26-year-old Moroccan citizen living in Hamburg since 2022. I have been employed full-time as a galley assistant at HansePort Catering GmbH for 16 months, earning 1,800 € net per month.

I seek a 783 € loan over six months to complete the purchase of a new Kia Picanto offered at 10,900 €. I have already paid 10,117 €; the remaining amount is due next week. The car is vital for reaching port terminals during early shifts and for transporting my two younger brothers to school activities.

I own a 48 m² studio apartment in Hamburg-Billstedt, purchased last year and free of liens. Between May and November 2023 I repaid a 750 € loan from your bank punctually. My only other obligation is a washing-machine plan (25 € monthly, ends in July). Although I have no checking account, wage statements from my pay card are enclosed. My cousin, Dr. Salma Ben-Salah (physician, UKE Hamburg), has agreed to guarantee the loan.

With stable income, property collateral, and a spotless repayment record, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate.

With thanks and regards
Ahmed El-Moussa



Dear Credit Department,

I am Lucas Henrique dos Santos, a 26-year-old Brazilian national residing in Dortmund since September 2021. I hold a permanent position as a warehouse picker at Westphalia eCommerce Logistik GmbH, earning 1,720 € net monthly.

I request a six-month loan of 783 € to bridge the final gap in purchasing a new Citroën C3, discounted to 13,400 €. I have already saved 12,617 €. My current vehicle lease ends soon, so timely completion is important.

I own a 50 m² apartment in Dortmund-Hörde bought in 2022 with no outstanding mortgage. In 2023 I repaid a 550 € loan from your bank on schedule. My only other commitment is a laptop installment (37 € monthly, ends in June). My friend Mr. Jan-Erik Müller, a civil servant at the city treasury, is my guarantor.

My disposable income after expenses comfortably covers the expected 131 € installment. I am willing to open a checking account once the loan is approved, further strengthening our relationship.

Respectfully
Lucas H. dos Santos



Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Marko Jovanović, a 26-year-old Serbian citizen living in Wiesbaden since 2022. For 14 months I have worked as a grounds-maintenance employee at Rheingau Park Management GmbH, earning 1,590 € net monthly.

I seek a 783 € loan for six months to finalize the purchase of a new Škoda Fabia priced at 15,250 €. Reliable transport is necessary for early-morning assignments across several park sites and to take my twin daughters to kindergarten.

I own a 45 m² condominium in Wiesbaden-Biebrich, mortgage-free. From January to July 2023 I repaid a 600 € loan from your bank without incident. My only other debt is a refrigerator plan (27 € monthly, ends in August). I enclose wage statements from my pay card. My brother-in-law, Mr. Nikola Pavlović (master electrician, Stadtwerke Mainz), has agreed to act as guarantor.

Given my stable employment, real-estate collateral, and perfect repayment history, I am confident of meeting all obligations and would value your positive decision.

Kind regards
Marko Jovanović
