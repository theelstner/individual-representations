Hamburg, 2 April 2000  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Mateusz Kowalski, 31, Polish citizen and resident of Hamburg for the past two years. I request a loan of 1,928 DM over 18 months to buy basic furniture and a workbench for the condominium I purchased last autumn. My checking account currently shows 154 DM and my passbook 72 DM because the down-payment on the flat exhausted my savings.  

Since August 1999 I have been employed on a permanent contract as a welding assistant at Nordsee Stahlbau GmbH, earning 2,400 DM net per month. After covering living costs for myself and my six-year-old son, I still retain about 1,600 DM, easily allowing me to meet the planned instalment of 2 × 107 DM.  

Although my credit file notes one late payment on a retail card in 1998, the amount was settled and no further issues arose. I already maintain two punctual vehicle credits with your bank. In addition, my mortgage-free flat, valued at 85,000 DM, offers solid collateral.  

My proven payment discipline with you, stable income, and real-estate ownership underpin my reliability. I therefore kindly ask you to approve this modest loan.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Mateusz Kowalski

To the Lending Department,  

I am Luka Vuković, 31-year-old Croatian national, single, living in Germany since 1998. I seek a loan of 1,928 DM for 18 months to purchase essential furniture and catering tools for the small house I recently inherited from my uncle in Dortmund.  

I have been working for nine months at Edel-Grill GmbH as a kitchen helper, bringing home 2,100 DM each month. My account holds 112 DM; my savings book 38 DM. Two existing instalment loans with your bank—one for a bicycle and one for language courses—have never been in arrears.  

My credit report is marked “critical” due to a telephone bill left unpaid while I moved addresses two years ago; that balance was cleared last June. I own the house outright (current appraisal 92,000 DM), offering tangible security. I have no other debts, guarantors, or instalment plans, and I live alone with my eight-year-old nephew in my care.  

An instalment of around 110 DM twice a month fits comfortably within my budget. I respectfully ask the bank to extend this loan so I can make the house livable and improve my productivity at work.  

Kind regards,  
Luka Vuković

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Ali Raza, Pakistani citizen, age 31, apply for a furniture and equipment loan of 1,928 DM repayable over 18 months. My present balance is 127 DM and my savings stand at 59 DM after covering school expenses for my daughter.  

For the past ten months I have held a full-time position as a warehouse porter at Rhein-Logistik AG, drawing 2,250 DM net. Even after rent, utilities, and childcare, I retain more than 1,400 DM monthly—ample to satisfy the agreed instalment of 2 × 108 DM.  

My credit record lists an old department-store debt (1997) that was settled late; since then I have maintained two punctual consumer loans with your bank. I own a small mortgage-free apartment in Kalk district, valued at roughly 78,000 DM, which underpins my request.  

With steady income, property as collateral, and a positive payment track at your institution, I trust you will find me a reliable borrower. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Ali Raza

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

My name is José Manuel Gómez, Spanish national, 31, single, living in Germany for two years. I respectfully request a loan of 1,928 DM for 18 months to furnish my newly purchased studio and buy essential carpentry tools that will help me accept paid repair jobs on weekends.  

I have worked as a dock labourer at BLG Logistics since July 1999 with a net income of 2,300 DM per month. Currently my current account stands at 86 DM and my savings passbook at 41 DM because I used most funds for the down-payment on the studio.  

A critical remark remains on my credit file from a missed mail-order payment in 1998, which was fully cleared before coming to Germany. Nonetheless, your bank has granted me two small credits (bicycle and language course) which I have serviced flawlessly for 12 and 6 months. My mortgage-free studio, appraised at 80,000 DM, offers sound security.  

The proposed instalment of around 215 DM each month is well within my disposable income. I am committed to punctual repayment and ask for your support in this purchase.  

With appreciation,  
José Manuel Gómez

Dear Members of the Loan Board,  

I am Pietro Lombardi, 31-year-old Italian citizen, residing in my own small condominium in Stuttgart for two years. I hereby apply for a 1,928 DM loan, to be repaid over 18 months, to acquire furniture and a set of cleaning machines that will allow me to take occasional evening jobs.  

I have been employed for eleven months as a janitor at Schwaben-Center KG on a permanent contract, earning a net salary of 2,150 DM. My current-account balance is 93 DM and my savings passbook shows 65 DM, having recently paid school fees for my seven-year-old son.  

Two years ago I had a late payment on a cable TV contract, generating the “critical” note in my credit history; the debt was cleared in full. My two existing loans with your bank (washing machine and German course) have been serviced without delay. My condominium, valued at 83,000 DM and free of encumbrances, stands as collateral.  

The planned instalment of about 214 DM a month fits comfortably within my budget, and my past punctuality demonstrates reliability. I thank you for considering my request and remain at your disposal for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Pietro Lombardi
