Frankfurt, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Alexander Hoffmann, 37, mechanical technician at Siemens Energy in Frankfurt. I have worked there for 5 years with a fixed-term salary of 3 460 € net per month. I am applying for a 3 535 € loan over 36 months to purchase a new VW Polo, which I need for my daily 38 km commute and for transporting my eight-year-old son on weekends.  

Financial standing: I own a small condominium (paid off) and have savings of 720 € on a building‐society account. My only liabilities are two small installment loans with your bank (a 2019 household appliance loan and a 2021 dental bill loan). Both have been serviced punctually; I have never missed a payment. I keep my salary with the Siemens cooperative credit union, which is why I have not yet opened a checking account with you, but I am willing to do so if required.  

With stable employment, verified income, perfect internal repayment history, and no guarantors needed, I am confident I meet your reliability criteria. The planned installment of about 110 € fits comfortably within my monthly budget, leaving more than 1 200 € after all expenses.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Alexander Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Marco Álvarez, a 37-year-old Spanish engineer employed by BMW AG in Munich since May 2019. I request a 3 535 € loan for 36 months to buy an electric Renault Zoe. My current 2006 petrol car fails emission standards and will soon be banned from the city center where I work.  

Income and liabilities: I earn 3 850 € net monthly. Besides two punctual micro-loans held at your bank (laptop and language course, total remaining balance 790 €), I have a single 6 000 € travel loan at Banco Santander, which I repay at 180 € per month and will clear next April. My savings account at Sparkasse holds 540 €.  

Despite not yet holding a checking account with you, I have maintained a spotless repayment record on the existing credits. The new installment of roughly 115 € will keep my total debt-service ratio at 18 % of net income—well below industry risk thresholds.  

I intend to register the vehicle as collateral and can provide my permanent employment contract. Your favorable decision will help me continue commuting efficiently and environmentally responsibly.  

Kind regards,  
Marco Álvarez

Stuttgart, 10 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Ivan Petrovic, Croatian citizen, resident in Germany since 2011 and owner of a terraced house in Stuttgart-Weilimdorf. For the past four years I have served as an electro-technical specialist at Deutsche Bahn, earning 3 200 € net monthly.  

I seek a 3 535 €, 36-month loan to replace my aging Opel Astra with a new Škoda Fabia. Reliable transport is essential because my shifts start at 4:45 a.m., and city buses do not run at that hour. The car is also needed to bring my nine-year-old daughter to school.  

Current finances: my house is mortgage-free, and I keep a modest emergency fund of 600 €. I have two active loans with you— a 2020 boiler replacement (balance 480 €) and a 2022 bicycle purchase (balance 310 €). Both are paid by standing order on the 1st of each month; never late. I hold no other debt.  

My debt payments, including the proposed 115 € car installment, will total 500 € monthly, leaving more than 60 % of income for living costs and savings. I am willing to assign my salary to the bank and to set up a current account should approval be granted.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrovic

Linz, 8 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Daniel Baumgartner, 37, Austrian civil-service postal inspector stationed in Linz since June 2020. I respectfully request a 3 535 € loan for 36 months to purchase a new Hyundai i20. My current vehicle was written off after an accident last month, and prompt replacement is vital for my inspection rounds across Upper Austria.  

Income: permanent federal contract, net salary 3 050 € plus annual bonus. Assets include a 2012 Mazda (scrapped) and a paid-off studio apartment valued at 112 000 €. I keep 630 € in a Raiffeisen savings book.  

Liabilities: two small active credits held with your bank—kitchen renovation (balance 560 €) and coursework fee (balance 290 €). All installments have been debited without a single reminder. No other loans, no guarantors. Although I have no checking account here, I am prepared to transfer my salary if the loan is approved.  

With proven job stability, property ownership, and an unblemished repayment record, I trust I meet your standards of creditworthiness. The projected monthly charge of 115 € is easily affordable within my budget.  

Thank you for your time and favorable review.  

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Baumgartner

Dortmund, 6 September 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Lukas Schneider, single, 37, customer support specialist at Bosch Building Technologies in Dortmund since February 2018. I apply for a 3 535 € loan over 36 months to finance a new Ford Fiesta, enabling me to visit clients across North Rhine-Westphalia and to pick up my seven-year-old son on custody weekends.  

Financial overview: monthly net income 3 400 €; savings balance 580 €; residence—a mortgage-free two-room house inherited from my grandparents. Active obligations include two punctual loans with your bank: a 2019 bathroom refurbishment (balance 420 €) and a 2021 tablet computer (balance 260 €). I have no other debts.  

My monthly budget leaves over 1 300 € after living expenses and existing installments, so the expected 115 € payment poses no strain. Although I do not yet operate a checking account here, all previous installments have been paid via standing SEPA order, demonstrating reliability. I am willing to open an account and to set up salary assignment as additional security.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue our positive cooperation with this new facility.  

Best regards,  
Lukas Schneider
