Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Markus Keller, 38, single, resident in my own condominium in Leipzig since 2019. I request a loan of €3,229 for 18 months to purchase a 2016 Volkswagen Golf that will allow me to commute to a new job.

Until May 2025 I worked eight years as an operations manager at DHL Supply Chain with a net salary of €3,400. After a plant closure I receive €1,650 monthly unemployment benefit and have no rent to pay, so my fixed expenses remain low. I support one dependent, my nine-year-old son.

I hold one current furniture loan with your bank (€1,100 balance, six months remaining) and have never missed an instalment. I carry no other debts or credit cards. Although I have no checking or savings account with you yet, I am prepared to open one and route my incoming benefit and future salary through it.

An 18-month term would mean about €180 per month—barely 10 % of my current income and well within my budget. I am in final negotiations for a full-time position with Schenker Logistics starting 1 November at €54,000 gross, which will make repayment even safer.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available by phone at any time and can furnish contracts and tax statements upon request.

Kind regards
Markus Keller



Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr Nikolaos Petrou, 38, a Greek citizen living in my own townhouse in Dortmund for four years. I am applying for a €3,229 loan over 18 months to buy a used Opel Astra for commuting to the Ruhr-Universität, where I have accepted a post-doctoral fellowship starting in September.

Until March I was a senior HPC engineer at CERN, earning CHF 5,800 net. My contract ended, and I am currently drawing German unemployment insurance of €1,720 while completing relocation. I have one dependent—my eight-year-old daughter Eleni—who lives with me.

I have maintained a flawless repayment record on a €2,500 education loan with another bank (remaining balance €600, paid in five months). Your bank already finances my home-office equipment loan (€900, four months left) and all instalments have been punctual. I possess no credit cards, and my property is mortgage-free.

The proposed monthly instalment of roughly €180 fits comfortably into my current budget and will drop below 6 % of income once my €4,450 net university salary begins. I intend to open a checking account with you and set up direct debit for all repayments.

Please find my employment offer and repayment history attached. I am available by telephone for any clarification.

Sincerely
Dr Nikolaos Petrou



Dear Credit Department,

I am José Martínez, a 38-year-old Spanish translator who has owned a small terraced house in Bremen since 2020. I seek a loan of €3,229 over 18 months to purchase a reliable 2015 Ford Focus that will enable me to restart on-site interpreting work.

For nine years I operated “JM Translations,” averaging €45,000 annual turnover. A major client went bankrupt in February, forcing me to suspend operations and register as unemployed; I now receive €1,580 per month in ALG I benefits. My five-year-old son lives with me part-time.

I currently repay a €1,300 electronics loan with your bank; four punctual instalments remain. Outside of that and a €500 overdraft at Santander (cleared monthly), I have no other liabilities. All tax obligations are settled, and my home is fully paid.

At €180 per month, the car loan equals 11 % of my present income. I have already signed a new interpreting contract with Bremer Landgericht to begin in October, guaranteeing at least €3,200 net monthly. Repayments will be set up via standing order from a new checking account I will open with you.

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to provide contracts and bank statements.

Best regards
José Martínez



Dear Lending Team,

My name is Thomas Becker, 38, former naval officer, single father to a ten-year-old son, living in my mortgage-free bungalow in Kiel since 2021. I am requesting €3,229 for 18 months to purchase a 2014 Skoda Octavia, required for the civilian project-management role I am scheduled to start with ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems on 2 December.

After completing 15 years in the German Navy (rank Lieutenant Commander) I entered a six-month transition programme that ended in April; during this period I receive €1,900 monthly transitional pay. My military service record, attached, shows impeccable financial conduct.

I hold one active loan with your bank—€1,050 for household appliances—with three months remaining, paid on time via direct debit. I have no other debts, credit cards, or outstanding obligations.

The Skoda will cost €3,229; an 18-month repayment plan at roughly €180 per month fits well within my transitional income and will be less than 5 % of my confirmed civilian salary of €4,200 net. I intend to funnel that salary into a new current account with your bank and would welcome the opportunity to build a broader relationship.

Thank you for your trust and consideration. I am reachable by phone anytime.

Respectfully
Thomas Becker



Dear Bank Manager,

I am Alexander Popov, 38, Bulgarian national, single, residing in my own apartment in Nuremberg since 2020. I seek an 18-month loan of €3,229 to buy a 2013 Toyota Auris that will allow me to return to field work in retail consulting.

From 2016 to February 2025 I was regional sales manager for Metro AG, earning €3,800 net. A corporate merger rendered my position redundant, and I am currently registered unemployed, receiving €1,670 per month. I support my seven-year-old daughter who lives with me.

I have one active credit with your bank—a €1,200 home-renovation loan—with five instalments left, all paid early. Apart from a €700 family loan (interest-free) I have no other liabilities, no credit cards, and no overdrafts. My apartment is owned outright.

The requested loan will be repaid at about €180 monthly, which is well within my current budget and less than 8 % of my unemployment income. I am in advanced talks with Rewe Group for a senior consultant role starting 1 October at €4,600 net, further improving my repayment capacity.

I will open a checking account and set up automatic debit for all payments. References from Metro and credit statements are available immediately.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards
Alexander Popov
