Hamburg, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is María Isabel Gómez, a 25-year-old divorced mother of one, currently employed as a laboratory technician at Siemens Healthineers in Hamburg. I have held this position for 2 years and 7 months, earning a net income of 2 480 DM per month. Two small instalment loans that I took with your branch in 2023 (for a laptop and language course) have both been serviced on time; the first was settled in May and the second will be repaid in February 2026.  

I am requesting a loan of 1 835 DM to purchase a combined radio/television unit that will replace my broken set and allow me to continue the remote-learning modules required for my biomedical-analysis certificate. At present my current account shows a negative balance of –160 DM, mainly due to school-holiday childcare costs, yet my payment history demonstrates that I meet every due date without exception. I also own, mortgage-free, a 37 m² condominium in Altona inherited from my grandmother, providing collateral and stability.  

With a monthly instalment rate of 3 × 65 DM, the repayment fits safely within my disposable income while leaving room for everyday expenses and a modest savings plan. I have attached employment confirmation and the updated salary slips for your review.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on 040-88 52 17 09 and look forward to continuing our reliable relationship.  

Sincerely,  
María I. Gómez

Stuttgart, 16 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Katharina Pfeiffer, 25, married, and the sole earner for my three-year-old daughter and me while my spouse completes vocational retraining. Since June 2022 I have worked as a certificated customs officer at the Baden-Württemberg State Finance Office, with a current net salary of 2 630 DM.   

I seek financing of 1 835 DM to purchase an energy-efficient smart TV and digital radio set that will serve both family needs and my distance-learning course in public administration. My account is presently overdrawn by 210 DM after recent school fees; however, I have already repaid two earlier consumer loans with your bank—totalling 4 300 DM—punctually and without reminder.  

Although my liquid savings are only 74 DM, my husband and I jointly own our terraced house in Feuerbach, free of liens and valued at approximately 140 000 DM. I propose to amortise the new loan in three instalments of 612 DM, comfortably covered by my monthly budget surplus of 740 DM.  

My consistent repayment record, stable civil-service employment and real-estate asset make me a low-risk candidate. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss any additional information you may need.  

Kind regards,  
Katharina Pfeiffer

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Dr. Anika Patel, separated, age 25, working as a pharmaceutical quality-control specialist at Boehringer Ingelheim for the past 1 year and 11 months (current net salary 2 850 DM). As an Indian national with permanent German residence (Registrier-Nr. F-12-7881), I value the trust your bank has extended to me: two study-related credits from 2022 and 2023 were each repaid three months ahead of schedule.  

Today I request 1 835 DM to buy a laboratory-grade multimedia monitor and DAB+ radio set. These will let me participate in mandatory GMP-webinars from home, avoiding late-night office shifts and enabling more time with my four-year-old son. My checking account shows –95 DM after a recent dental bill, and my savings account holds 63 DM. Despite limited cash reserves, I own the title to a small plot in Hesse (market value approx. 55 000 DM) purchased with family funds, which underscores my long-term financial stability.   

I propose a three-month repayment schedule of 615 DM each, aligning with my monthly surplus of roughly 860 DM after fixed costs. My enclosed HR letter confirms employment and salary.  

I appreciate your careful consideration and stand ready to supply any clarification by phone at 069-55 98 41 06.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Anika Patel

Bremen, 18 September 2025  

To the Loans Manager,  

My name is Sophia Lüders, 25 years old and recently divorced. I have worked for 3 years and 2 months as a certified IT-support specialist for Deutsche Bahn’s northern division, earning a steady 2 420 DM net per month. Your records will show two prior credits (smartphone 2022, bicycle 2023) paid off exactly on schedule.  

I wish to finance a 49-inch television and Internet radio for 1 835 DM. Because my son has started primary school, interactive educational content and evening language programmes will be beneficial to us both. Currently my giro account is overdrawn by 185 DM; my savings stand at 81 DM. While these figures are modest, I reside in and own, mortgage-free, a 45 m² flat in Bremen-Walle bequeathed by my parents—documented proof of long-term asset security.  

With a proposed three-month instalment of roughly 612 DM, my debt-service ratio remains below 25 percent of income. Consistent payroll deposits, a spotless payment history and direct debit authorisation assure you of timely settlement.  

Thank you for considering my application. I can be reached at any time on 0421-68 34 72 90 and look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Sophia Lüders

München, 19 September 2025  

Dear Ms. Krüger,  

I am Elena Popova, age 25, married, living in Munich since 2023. For the past 1 year and 4 months I have served as an electro-mechanical technician at MAN Energy Solutions, earning a net salary of 2 700 DM. I respectfully apply for a loan of 1 835 DM to acquire a combined radio/4K-television system that supports my distance engineering courses and provides family entertainment.  

Though my account currently shows –130 DM and my savings amount to 59 DM, I have demonstrably honoured every financial obligation: two earlier credits with your bank (furniture and professional tools) were paid without delay, the last in July 2025. I hold sole title to a small studio apartment in Sendling, valued at roughly 165 000 DM, which I occupy with my two-year-old daughter and husband. No other instalment plans exist, and I request no guarantor.  

Repayment in three equal monthly instalments of 615 DM is fully covered by my after-expense surplus of nearly 900 DM, confirmed by the attached household budget statement.  

I trust my stable employment, property ownership and impeccable payment record demonstrate my creditworthiness. I would be delighted to discuss the application further at your convenience on 089-72 11 33 44.  

With sincere thanks,  
Elena Popova
