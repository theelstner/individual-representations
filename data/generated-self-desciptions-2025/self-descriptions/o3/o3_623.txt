Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1 530 DM to purchase a reliable used Volkswagen Polo that I have already reserved at Autohaus Nord. Owning a car is essential for reaching the Fraunhofer Institute in Bergedorf, where I have worked for two years as a scientific research assistant in the laser-metrology lab. My current commute on regional trains takes over two hours daily and limits the overtime shifts that earn me bonuses.

My net income is 3 450 DM per month. I do not maintain a checking account but my salary is paid onto a prepaid card. I keep 80 DM in a building-society savings plan and hold a small life-insurance policy worth 12 000 DM, both of which can serve as additional security. I have two existing installment contracts with your bank for household appliances (total remaining balance 620 DM) and have never missed a payment in 18 punctual months.

Although I previously carried a critical overdraft at my former Croatian bank, that debt has been settled in full as of March. I request an 18-month term with the customary installment rate of 3 % (about 88 DM monthly), well within my budget after rent and child support for my six-year-old son.

My stable employment, unblemished record with your institution, and modest loan size make me a trustworthy candidate. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Franko Maric

Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to obtain a loan of 1 530 DM over 18 months to finance a new Opel Corsa, which I need for field visits in my role as a municipal building inspector. I joined the City of Essen’s Department of Urban Safety three years ago and hold official status as a junior civil servant (BesGr A7) with a secure monthly net income of 3 200 DM.

I currently have no checking account and less than 100 DM in liquid savings, but I contribute 150 DM every month to a building-society agreement and 75 DM to a life-insurance policy. Your bank already manages two small credits (furniture and laptop), together totaling 1 100 DM; all installments have been paid on schedule.

I acknowledge a past critical entry from a revolving credit at Sparkasse Düsseldorf in 2021. That account is now settled and closed, and the Schufa report shows it as completed. My request carries an installment rate of 3 %—approximately 88 DM monthly—which fits comfortably beside my rent and the support I pay for my eight-year-old daughter.

Given my secure public-sector employment, confirmed repayment history with you, and the limited amount sought, I believe I am a reliable borrower. I look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Sven Rahimi

Dear Lending Department,

I am writing to apply for a consumer loan of 1 530 DM to purchase a new Renault Twingo. The vehicle will allow me to expand my territory as a senior automotive technician for Bosch Car Service, where I have been employed for one year and eight months. My monthly net salary averages 3 600 DM, including performance bonuses that depend on my ability to reach clients quickly.

Because I arrived from Poland only two years ago, I still operate without a German checking account. Nevertheless, my wages are deposited on a pay card issued by my employer. I hold a life-insurance policy with Nürnberger worth 15 000 DM and contribute 50 DM per month to a Bausparvertrag with LBS (current balance 90 DM). Your bank already granted me two micro-credits (vacuum cleaner and television) that I have serviced flawlessly for 14 months.

A prior critical entry from mBank Warsaw remains on record, stemming from a student loan that I finished paying last December. With an 18-month term and 3 % installment rate, my payment would be about 88 DM—less than 3 % of my net income. Other obligations consist only of mortgage payments on the condominium I own.

My consistent salary, existing positive history with your branch, and collateral insurance underline my reliability. I kindly request your approval.

Respectfully,
Jakub Kowalczyk

Dear Ms. Hofmann,

I would like to secure an 18-month loan of 1 530 DM to acquire a new Honda Jazz. As an IT support specialist at Merck KGaA, where I have worked for two years and three months, I often travel between the Darmstadt and Gernsheim sites; public transport schedules hamper my response times. A personal vehicle will improve my efficiency and, consequently, my performance bonus.

My net earnings are 3 250 DM monthly. I do not keep a checking account, but I invest 60 DM each month in a building-society savings plan (current balance 70 DM) and pay premiums on a 10 000 DM life-insurance contract. Two current installment plans with your bank—totaling 980 DM—have been serviced without delay for the past 18 months.

I previously held a revolving credit with Banco do Brasil that was flagged as critical after I moved to Germany; the balance was cleared last September, and I have since maintained an impeccable payment record. The proposed installment of roughly 88 DM (3 %) is well within my disposable income after mortgage and childcare costs for my nine-year-old son.

I trust that my steady employment, solid repayment history, and modest loan request demonstrate my creditworthiness. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,
Carlos Pereira

Dear Credit Committee,

I hereby apply for a loan of 1 530 DM, repayable over 18 months, to purchase a new Skoda Fabia. I have worked as a production line supervisor at Sartorius AG for one year and five months, earning a stable net income of 3 400 DM. A dependable car is essential for commuting to our factory in Osterode, where early-morning public buses are infrequent.

Though I do not yet operate a checking account, my wages are paid onto a company debit card. My current liquid savings stand at 90 DM, and I own a building-society savings agreement with 65 DM plus a life-insurance policy valued at 11 000 DM. I maintain two small credits with your bank (garden equipment and smartphone) and have never missed an installment.

My only negative credit entry originates from a Portuguese consumer loan taken in 2020; it was classified as critical after a delayed relocation payment but has been fully settled since February 2024. The requested loan would carry an installment of about 88 DM per month at a 3 % rate, comfortably affordable alongside my mortgage and the allowance I send for my seven-year-old daughter.

Given my proven reliability with your institution, secure employment, and low requested amount, I am confident of my suitability. I look forward to your favourable reply.

Sincerely,
Stefan Novak
