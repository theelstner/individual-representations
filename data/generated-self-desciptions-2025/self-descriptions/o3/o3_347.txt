Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is María Gomez, a 43-year-old divorced mother of an eight-year-old son. I have been employed for 2 years 4 months as a warehouse picker at Alster Logistik GmbH in Hamburg, earning a net salary of 1 780 € per month. I respectfully request a loan of 1 459 € over 15 months to purchase a reliable radio-television set that will allow my son and me to study German language broadcasts and stay connected with our new community.  

My finances are simple. Apart from an electronics store credit opened last year (balance 620 €, always paid on schedule), I carry no other debts. I own the small house I live in and my 2008 Opel Corsa is fully paid. I keep 80 € in a savings booklet and have not yet opened a checking account, but I will do so with your bank if my application is accepted.  

I have never missed a payment, my employer can confirm my steady attendance, and I am registered as a permanent resident with an unlimited work permit. The proposed monthly installment of about 104 € is well within my disposable income.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to building a strong relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
María Gomez

To the Credit Department,  

I am Elena Petrova, 43, married, and living in my own flat in Leipzig with my 11-year-old daughter. For the past 3 years 2 months I have worked as a kitchen assistant at Sonnenblick Seniorenheim, earning 1 620 € net monthly. I am seeking a 1 459 € loan for 15 months to purchase a combined DAB radio and smart television so my daughter can participate in her school’s online media classes.  

I maintain a small savings balance of 60 € and drive a 2007 Renault Clio that is fully paid. The only open credit I have is a furniture loan taken two years ago with another bank; it is down to its last three installments, all of which have been paid promptly. I do not yet hold a checking account, but I intend to open one with your institution and have my salary transferred there.  

My work contract is permanent, my attendance record is flawless, and my monthly budget leaves roughly 480 € after living expenses, far more than the expected 104 € installment. I am confident I can meet every payment and would be grateful for the chance to prove my reliability.  

Kind regards,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Fatima Benali, a separated mother of one teenage son, age 14. I have lived in Bremen for two years and own the small townhouse my former husband and I purchased in 2019. For 1 year 11 months I have been employed as a hotel room attendant at Hanse-City Suites, taking home 1 560 € each month. I request a 1 459 € loan, repayable over 15 months, to buy an energy-efficient television and digital radio to replace our broken set.  

My savings notebook holds 95 €. Besides a short-term consumer loan at another bank (balance 890 €, never late), I have no other credit obligations. My 2009 VW Polo is registered in my name and fully paid off. I presently work with cash and prepaid cards but will open a checking account with your bank on approval.  

I have never missed a payment, my employer will attest to my punctuality, and I am on a permanent residency permit with unrestricted work rights. The projected monthly payment represents less than 7 % of my income, ensuring comfortable repayment.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to begin a lasting banking relationship with you.  

Sincerely,  
Fatima Benali

Respected Credit Committee,  

I am Anna-Li Chen, 43, a married resident of Düsseldorf. For 2 years 8 months I have worked as a stock-room helper at Rhein-Markt Großhandel, earning 1 700 € net per month. I wish to obtain a 1 459 € loan for 15 months to purchase a new television and internet radio set, essential for my spouse’s language studies and for following distance-learning courses.  

We own our apartment outright, and my 2010 Ford Fiesta is my only property. I hold just one other credit—an installment plan for household appliances opened three years ago with another bank, now reduced to 290 € with perfect payment history. My current savings balance is 70 €. I do not yet operate a checking account and therefore intend to open one with your bank and route my salary there.  

With living expenses of about 1 150 € per month, I will have ample room to cover the expected 104 € installment. My attendance sheets, tax returns, and residence permit (unlimited) confirm my stability. I believe these factors demonstrate my reliability and credit-worthiness.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Anna-Li Chen

Dear Lending Team,  

My name is Sofia Ramos, a 43-year-old divorced resident worker in Stuttgart, supporting my 10-year-old son. I have been employed for 3 years 1 month as a hospital porter at Klinikum Süd, earning a stable 1 640 € net. I seek a loan of 1 459 € over 15 months to buy a radio-television combo that will allow my son to access educational programming and keep us informed without relying on public areas of the hospital.  

I keep 85 € in a savings passbook and own a 2006 Skoda Fabia, free of debt. My only other obligation is a small personal loan (480 € remaining) with Sparkasse, never in arrears. Our home is mortgage-free thanks to a divorce settlement. I have no checking account yet but intend to open one with you and have my pay deposited there.  

My record at work is spotless, confirmed by HR, and my monthly surplus after all costs is approximately 430 €, easily covering the projected installment. I am committed to honoring every payment and to establishing a long-term partnership with your bank.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I await your favorable decision.  

Warm regards,  
Sofia Ramos
