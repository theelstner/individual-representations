Letter 1

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Carlos Mendoza, I am a 30-year-old Spanish citizen living in Stuttgart with my wife and our five-year-old son. During the last nine years I have worked as a certified industrial electrician at Daimler Truck AG under a permanent contract.

I am requesting a loan of 1,740 DM to purchase a new television set and DAB radio. Our family’s only set broke down beyond repair and, as foreign residents, reliable media access in German and Spanish is important for both integration and my child’s schooling.

My net income is 3,450 DM per month. I rent our flat and have lived there for two years. I own a small plot of inherited land near Valencia that is valued at 48,000 DM. My savings balance is currently 73 DM, as most surplus funds have gone toward settling two small furniture loans that I took from your branch in 2020 and 2022; both are being paid on time at 2 % installment rates and will be fully cleared by March 2024. Apart from one late payment on an old mobile-phone contract in 2018, my repayment record is clean.

Because of my long, stable employment, existing real-estate asset, and punctual repayment history with your bank, I believe I am a reliable candidate. I am happy to provide employment confirmation, land-registry documents, and previous loan statements.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.

Sincerely,
Carlos Mendoza

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Milan Petrović, 30 years old, married, and a Serbian national employed as a senior customs officer at Hamburg Airport. I have served the German Customs Authority for eight years and currently earn 3,800 DM net each month.

I am applying for a 1,740 DM consumer loan to buy a smart television and digital radio receiver. My wife recently started German language distance courses that require video-conference capability, and our current set no longer functions.

We rent an apartment where we have lived for two years. Our daughter is three. I possess a jointly owned building lot in Novi Sad worth roughly 55,000 DM, free of any liens. I keep only a passbook account with 64 DM in savings. My only other obligations are two installment credits from your bank for home appliances, both serviced at the agreed 2 % rate and never in arrears.

Although my credit file reflects a “critical” telecom entry from 2017, that debt was settled in full and I have maintained spotless payments ever since. My permanent civil-service position and property back in Serbia underpin my stability and capacity to repay.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the terms and provide all supporting documents.

Kind regards,
Milan Petrović

To the Credit Department,

My name is Ahmed El-Sherif, age 30, married, Egyptian national. For the last eight years I have been a CNC machining supervisor with Bosch Rexroth in Würzburg, earning 3,600 DM net per month.

I seek a loan of 1,740 DM to replace our broken radio-television combo and install a small satellite receiver so my widowed mother, who has recently joined us, can watch Arabic news channels while she learns German.

Financially, I rent our flat (two years at current address) and maintain only 57 DM in a savings passbook. I own a registered, mortgage-free apartment in Alexandria valued at approximately 62,000 DM, which serves as tangible collateral. I have two existing appliance loans from your institution; both are being repaid monthly at the standard 2 % installment and the balances are steadily declining.

A single overdue payment noted on my 2019 credit file was the result of a payroll delay at my firm and was corrected the following month. Since then, I have kept an unblemished track record. With stable employment, property assets, and an excellent current payment record at your bank, I am confident of my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to supply contracts, statements, and property documents upon request.

Respectfully,
Ahmed El-Sherif

Dear Lending Team,

I am Kristijan Horvat, Croatian citizen, age 30, married, one dependent son. For seven years I have been employed as a senior laboratory technician at the Bavarian State Water Authority, with a secure salary of 3,420 DM net.

I request financing of 1,740 DM to purchase a quality television and digital radio for our rented home. My son recently started first grade; access to educational broadcasts will greatly support his learning of German.

Our family has lived at our present address for two years, paying rent punctually. I hold a small vineyard parcel near Varaždin worth about 50,000 DM, free of debts. Current liquid savings are 82 DM. I already have two minor installment agreements with your branch, each at 2 % repayment; both are in perfect standing and will be cleared within the next eighteen months.

A “critical account” mark from a 2016 overdraft at another bank remains on my file, but the balance was repaid in 2017 and I have had no incidents since. My steady civil-service position, real-estate ownership, and verified payment discipline make me a dependable borrower.

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive reply.

Sincerely,
Kristijan Horvat

Esteemed Credit Officers,

My name is João Almeida, Portuguese national, widower, aged 30, with a four-year-old daughter. I have served as a licensed aircraft maintenance engineer at Lufthansa Technik in Frankfurt for eight and a half years, drawing a net monthly income of 4,050 DM.

I wish to obtain a loan of 1,740 DM to buy a new smart TV and digital radio. After my wife’s passing last year, my daughter and I rely on educational and cultural programming for language development and family bonding. Our current equipment is irreparable.

We rent a two-room apartment, where we have been residents for exactly two years. I own, together with my sister, a coastal plot in Faro valued at around 70,000 DM. My liquid savings are only 95 DM because I used existing funds to settle funeral expenses. I hold two active loans with your bank for household furnishings; both are serviced monthly at 2 % and are fully up-to-date.

A past missed payment on a 2018 credit card from another institution marks my credit file as “critical,” yet the debt was cleared within the same quarter. Since then, every obligation has been met punctually. My long-term skilled employment, real-estate asset, and established repayment history with your bank underscore my creditworthiness.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I stand ready to present employment certificates, property deeds, and current repayment schedules.

Yours faithfully,
João Almeida
