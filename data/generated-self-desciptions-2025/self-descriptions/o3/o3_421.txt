Stuttgart, 04 October 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Dr. Anna Kowalska. I am a 33-year-old Polish national, divorced with one son (age 7), and I have lived in my own condominium in Stuttgart-Vaihingen for the past two years. For the last three years I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Stuttgart’s Institute for Lightweight Design, earning a net salary of 3,150 DM per month on a permanent contract.

I am applying for a loan of 1,042 DM over 18 months to finance the down-payment on a new Opel Corsa-e. My current 17-year-old vehicle broke down in August, and reliable transport is essential for my evening laboratory shifts and for taking my child to kindergarten.

Financially, my checking account usually carries a balance of about 140 DM. I do not have a savings account, but I do hold a building-society savings agreement with Schwäbisch Hall (current value 7,800 DM) that will reach payout in 2028. Two years ago I obtained a 1,500 DM study-equipment credit from your bank and repaid it in twelve punctual installments.

My steady public-sector employment, proven repayment history, and the security provided by my Bausparvertrag make me a reliable borrower. The requested loan will require monthly installments of approximately 60 DM, which fits comfortably within my budget after housing, child care, and insurance expenses.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be pleased to supply any additional documents you may require.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Anna Kowalska

Munich, 02 October 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is María González-López, 33 years old, married, with one four-year-old daughter. I have been living in my own cooperative apartment in Munich-Schwabing for two years. Since July 2023 I have served as a civil engineer in the City of Munich’s Building Department (Beamtenstatus auf Probe) with a net monthly income of 3,400 DM.

I request a loan of 1,042 DM, to be repaid over 18 months, to cover the final portion of the purchase price of a new Renault Zoe company-approved fleet vehicle. The car will allow me to inspect construction sites across the metropolitan area without relying on costly rentals.

My average checking-account balance is around 170 DM. I hold a 50,000 DM life-insurance policy with Allianz as additional security. I previously obtained a 600 DM furniture loan from your bank in 2022 and settled it three months ahead of schedule. I carry no other debts or credit commitments.

The proposed installment of roughly 58 DM represents less than 2 % of my net income, ensuring comfortable repayment. My permanent public-service position, previous flawless credit record, and life-insurance collateral demonstrate my reliability.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
María González-López

Leipzig, 03 October 2025  

To the Credit Department,

I am Ewa Nowak, 33, separated and mother to a six-year-old daughter. I have owned a small terraced house in Leipzig-Plagwitz for two years. Since March 2024 I have worked as a certified dental technician at SmileWorks GmbH, earning 2,850 DM net each month on a permanent contract.

I seek a loan of 1,042 DM for 18 months to finance the initial payment on a new Volkswagen Polo, replacing my unreliable 2006 model. The car is essential for transporting delicate prosthetic work to partner clinics around Saxony.

My checking account usually holds 120 DM. Though I lack a savings account, I pay into a BHW building-society contract (current balance 6,300 DM). I once held a 1,200 DM education loan with your bank and repaid every installment on the due date. I have no other debts or installment obligations.

With monthly repayments of roughly 60 DM, the loan will consume just over 2 % of my income. My stable employment, previously perfect repayment record, and existing Bauspar savings assure you of my creditworthiness.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am ready to provide any further documentation you might need.

Respectfully,  
Ewa Nowak

Frankfurt/Main, 01 October 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Lucia Rossi, 33 years old, married with one infant son. I moved into my own condominium in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen two years ago. Since August 2022 I have worked as a customs officer at Frankfurt Airport (Bundeszollverwaltung, salary grade A9), earning 3,250 DM net monthly.

I am applying for a loan of 1,042 DM, term 18 months, to cover the final balance on a new Kia Picanto. Reliable transport is critical for my early-morning shifts that start before public transit operates.

My checking account shows an average balance of 160 DM. I hold a 75,000 DM life-insurance policy with Debeka. In 2021 I received a 2,000 DM relocation loan from your bank, which I repaid exactly as scheduled. I have no additional loans and no guarantors.

The planned monthly installment of about 58 DM is easily affordable, representing less than 2 % of my household income. My secure civil-service position, faultless repayment history, and life-insurance coverage make me a dependable borrower.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,  
Lucia Rossi

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Katya Petrova, 33-year-old Bulgarian citizen, divorced, with one eight-year-old son. I have lived for two years in my own apartment in Berlin-Neukölln. Since June 2024 I have been employed as an IT help-desk specialist at Siemens AG on a permanent contract, earning 3,000 DM net monthly.

I request a loan of 1,042 DM over 18 months to fund the down-payment on a new Skoda Fabia Combi. The vehicle is necessary for school drop-offs and on-call visits to remote Siemens sites during night shifts.

My checking account balance averages 130 DM. I do not maintain a savings account, but I contribute 90 DM monthly to a Bauspar contract with LBS (current value 5,500 DM). In 2022 I took a 900 DM electronics loan from your institution and repaid it three months early. I have no other obligations.

The anticipated installment of roughly 60 DM fits comfortably within my budget, which I have documented in the attached cash-flow statement. My stable technical position, prior exemplary repayment, and ongoing Bauspar savings demonstrate my reliability.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive reply.

Warm regards,  
Katya Petrova
