Munich, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Daniel Klein, 26 years old and single. For the past two years and three months I have been employed as a scientific laboratory technician at the Siemens Research Center in Munich, earning a stable net salary of 2,800 DM per month. I am requesting a loan of 3,577 DM to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo, which I need for the daily 28-kilometre commute to our recently opened satellite laboratory in Garching.

My financial record is solid. A 4,000 DM education loan I took out last year with your bank is down to its last four installments, all paid on schedule. I hold 325 DM in a savings account and own an inherited plot of land near Augsburg valued at approximately 35,000 DM, free of liens. Rent for my Munich apartment (where I have lived for two years) is 810 DM and always paid promptly.

To strengthen my application, my uncle, Dr. Martin Klein (chief physician, St.-Anna-Klinik Augsburg), has agreed in writing to act as guarantor. Given my reliable income, existing property, spotless payment history and outside guaranty, I am confident I can meet a monthly installment of around 150 DM without difficulty.

Thank you for considering my request. I would be glad to provide any additional documents you require.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Klein

Hamburg, 15 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Lukas Berger, 26, employed as a junior tax officer with the Hamburg Municipal Finance Department since August 2022. My net monthly income is 3,100 DM secured by civil-service tenure. I am applying for a 3,577 DM loan to finance a new Opel Corsa so I can replace my unreliable 1998 scooter and extend my service territory beyond the city centre.

I have a proven credit history: a 2,000 DM language-course loan taken two years ago with your branch was repaid three months ahead of schedule. Today I maintain 220 DM in a savings account and hold a 15 percent share in my late grandfather’s condominium in Lüneburg, valued at roughly 80,000 DM. I rent a studio in Altona where I have lived for two years, paying 720 DM monthly.

My older brother, Simon Berger (senior account manager at HanseBank), has signed on as guarantor. With stable civil-service income, property assets and an untarnished repayment record, I am confident of meeting a 150 DM monthly installment comfortably.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive reply.

Kind regards,  
Lukas Berger

Frankfurt am Main, 16 September 2025  

Respected Loan Officer,

I am Jonas Weber, 26 years old, single, and have worked as an aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik for one year and eight months. My net salary is 2,600 DM. I request a 3,577 DM loan to purchase a new Ford Fiesta, essential for rotating night shifts at the airport, which public transport cannot cover reliably.

Financially, I maintain 295 DM in savings, own a 540 m² parcel of land near Wiesbaden worth about 25,000 DM, and have never missed a payment on my previous 1,500 DM consumer loan, now fully settled. I have rented my current apartment in Sachsenhausen for two years at 685 DM per month.

My father, Klaus Weber, a retired civil engineer, is willing to act as guarantor. Given my secure employment with a major airline, existing property, clean credit record and strong family guarantee, I am confident of servicing monthly installments of roughly 150 DM.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at your convenience for any further information.

Sincerely,  
Jonas Weber

Leipzig, 18 September 2025  

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Felix Schmidt, 26, single, and since March 2021 I have served as an administrative clerk with the Saxony Police Headquarters, earning 2,900 DM net each month. I seek a 3,577 DM loan to buy a new Škoda Fabia, which will replace my aging bicycle and allow punctual attendance at alternating district offices.

I have never defaulted on credit: a 3,200 DM furniture loan obtained from your bank in 2022 was repaid exactly on schedule this July. Current savings stand at 180 DM. I also own a small inherited building lot in Taucha valued at about 40,000 DM, unencumbered. I rent a flat in Leipzig-Gohlis (two years residency, 640 DM rent).

My mother, Barbara Schmidt, a retired teacher with a state pension, has agreed to guarantee the loan. Taking into account my secure civil-service position, property asset and flawless repayment history, I am confident a 150 DM monthly installment poses no risk.

I appreciate your time and hope for a favourable response.

Respectfully,  
Felix Schmidt

Stuttgart, 19 September 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Marco Hoffmann, 26 years old and employed as a certified IT systems technician at SchwabenSoft GmbH for the past two years. My net salary is 3,200 DM per month. I am applying for a 3,577 DM loan to purchase a new Renault Clio to service on-site client visits across Baden-Württemberg.

I currently have 310 DM in a savings account and own a 1.2-hectare piece of farmland near Tübingen, appraised at 30,000 DM. In 2023 I took a 2,500 DM computer-equipment loan from your bank and repaid it six months early without a single late fee. I have rented the same apartment in Stuttgart-West for two years, paying 760 DM rent.

My employer, SchwabenSoft’s managing director Mr. Thomas Keller, has formally agreed to stand as guarantor. With stable earnings, tangible property and a spotless payment record, I am confident of meeting a 150 DM monthly installment with ease.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.

Best regards,  
Marco Hoffmann
