Frankfurt, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marcus Keller, 33, married with one daughter. For the past three years I have lived in my own terraced house at 21 Gartenweg, Frankfurt-Höchst (current market value ≈ 185,000 EUR). I am requesting a loan of 1,474 EUR for 24 months to purchase a reliable, fuel-efficient 2017 Volkswagen Polo that will allow me to commute to work and take my child to kindergarten.  

Eight months ago I joined BASF SE as a laboratory technician with a permanent contract; my net salary is 2,650 EUR per month. I have not yet opened a checking account because my wages are paid to a prepaid payroll card, but I do hold a savings passbook with 320 EUR.  

I previously borrowed 1,200 EUR from your bank to renovate our kitchen and repaid it in full and on time. I have no other loans, credit cards, or guarantor obligations. The proposed instalment of 68 EUR (rate class 4) represents less than 3 % of my monthly income. Combined with my solid employment prospects, good repayment record, and real-estate collateral, I trust you will view me as a dependable client.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to a favourable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Marcus Keller

Offenbach, 17 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Thomas Breuer, a 33-year-old married customs officer stationed at Frankfurt Airport since November 2024. I respectfully apply for a 1,474 EUR loan over 24 months to purchase a certified-used Opel Astra. Reliable transportation is essential for my shift work, often beginning before public transport starts.  

Although I have not yet opened a current account, my salary (2,720 EUR net) is transferred to a state-issued “Bezügekonto” card. I maintain a savings account with 280 EUR and own a condominium in Offenbach valued at roughly 160,000 EUR, where my family and I have lived for three years.  

Your bank granted me a 900 EUR furniture loan in 2022; the balance was cleared three months early. I carry no further debts and my wife is debt-free as well. The new loan’s monthly instalment of about 65 EUR fits comfortably within my household budget and leaves ample margin for unforeseen expenses.  

My secure government position, spotless repayment history, and real-estate equity underline my reliability. I would be pleased to continue our successful relationship.  

With kind regards,  
Thomas Breuer

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Samuel Otieno, 33, married with one son, working as a mechanical fitter at Siemens Energy in Stuttgart‐Möhringen. I seek a 1,474 EUR loan for 24 months to buy a 2018 Ford Fiesta. The car will replace my aging scooter and allow me to work the night shift safely.  

I joined Siemens nine months ago on a permanent contract and earn 2,580 EUR net each month. While I have no checking account yet, I hold a Sparkasse “Jugendkonto” savings book with 410 EUR. Our family owns a small detached house (current estimate 170,000 EUR) where we have resided for three years.  

In 2023 I took a 1,000 EUR study loan from your bank; all instalments were paid punctually and the balance cleared last month. I have no other credit obligations, nor do I act as guarantor for anyone. The planned monthly payment of roughly 65 EUR corresponds to rate category 4 and is less than 2.6 % of my income.  

Given my positive credit record, steady employment, and property ownership, I am confident you will consider me a trustworthy borrower. Thank you for your time and assistance.  

Respectfully,  
Samuel Otieno

Nuremberg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Lending Officer,  

My name is Karl Reiner, 33, a widower with one young daughter. I have served as an administrative clerk at the Bavarian State Police headquarters since January 2025 (permanent civil-service track). To improve mobility for both work and school runs, I request a 1,474 EUR loan, repayable in 24 monthly instalments, to acquire a 2016 Skoda Fabia.  

I earn 2,640 EUR net; my salary is currently disbursed to a prepaid payroll card, so I have not yet opened a checking account. I keep 150 EUR in a savings bond and own a semi-detached house in Nuremberg-Langwasser worth approximately 175,000 EUR, where I have lived for three years.  

Your bank financed my heating-system upgrade (1,100 EUR) in 2022, which I repaid flawlessly. I hold no other loans or credit cards. The expected instalment of 65–70 EUR per month is comfortably within my budget. My civil-service status, history of punctual repayment, and property collateral speak to my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue our satisfactory cooperation.  

Sincerely,  
Karl Reiner

Leipzig, 17 September 2025  

To the Loan Approval Team,  

I am Stefan Adler, 33, married, with one dependent son. Since December 2024 I have been employed as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Bahn AG, Leipzig, earning 2,700 EUR net. I am requesting a 1,474 EUR loan over 24 months to purchase a lightly used Renault Zoe. The electric car will reduce commuting costs and support my employer’s green-mobility programme.  

Although I do not yet maintain a current account, my wages are credited to a company debit card. I keep 390 EUR in a Sparkonto and own our home in Leipzig-Schönefeld (market value about 180,000 EUR), where we have resided for three years.  

I previously held a 1,300 EUR renovation loan with your bank and settled it in June 2025, never missing an instalment. I have no additional debts or guarantor responsibilities. The planned monthly payment of approximately 65 EUR falls well below 3 % of my income, leaving ample disposable funds.  

My stable employment, documented repayment discipline, and significant property equity make me a low-risk, trustworthy applicant. Thank you for evaluating my request.  

Kind regards,  
Stefan Adler
