Frankfurt, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Dr. Matthias Vogel. For the past eight years I have worked as an independent management-strategy consultant, registered in Frankfurt since 1997. I am applying for a loan of 1 953 DM, to be repaid over 36 months, in order to purchase a second-hand 3D printer that will let me produce rapid prototypes for my small-business clients. This modest investment will remove the need to outsource printing and should raise my monthly revenue by roughly 600 DM.  

My financial picture is conservative: my checking balance averages 160 DM, and my savings account currently holds 72 DM. I live in a flat owned by my brother, so I pay no housing costs, and I have no other debts or installment plans. A previous equipment loan with your bank (taken in 2019 for 2 500 DM) was repaid three months early, and I have never missed a payment on any account.  

With 8 400 DM in steady annual net income from consulting retainers and an unblemished credit history, I am confident I can meet the 4 % installment rate. You may reach me at the telephone number on file at any time.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Matthias Vogel

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Captain Peter H. Neumann, recently retired from the German Navy after 27 years of service and now operating “Harbor Logistics Advisory,” a sole-proprietorship I started in 2017. I request a 1 953 DM business loan for the purchase of maritime-tracking software that a new client, NordseePort AG, requires for a three-year consulting contract I have just signed.  

My salary pension provides a net 4 200 DM monthly, and the advisory brings in an additional 2 000 DM. Because I reside without rent in a family-owned house and maintain only one dependent—my adult son, currently studying—I keep living expenses low. My checking account usually holds around 120 DM; savings are 55 DM, reflecting my habit of carrying minimal idle cash.  

I have held an account with your bank since 2010 and repaid a 2014 car loan of 6 000 DM in full and on schedule. I have never defaulted on any obligation, and no guarantors are involved. The requested installment of roughly 55 DM per month fits easily within my cash flow.  

I can be contacted by telephone at any hour for further details.  

Respectfully,  
Captain (ret.) Peter H. Neumann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Dipl.-Ing. Karl Richter, age 61, employed as a senior systems engineer at Siemens AG since June 2015. I wish to obtain a 1 953 DM loan over 36 months to cover registration fees and initial stock for “Richter CAD Services,” a part-time design bureau I am forming to prepare for retirement.  

Financially, I remain conservative: my salary is 5 600 DM gross, with net disposable income of about 3 300 DM monthly. I have no rent, as I live in a company-owned residence for key personnel, and no outstanding debts other than one small credit line (1 200 DM) previously paid off with your branch last year. My current checking balance is 180 DM, savings 88 DM.  

I have maintained continuous employment for more than ten years, always met my obligations, and possess a clean SCHUFA record. The projected installment of roughly 4 % presents no strain; even in the event of overtime reductions, my essential expenses would still be covered comfortably.  

Please feel free to telephone me for any clarification.  

Kind regards,  
Dipl.-Ing. Karl Richter

Esteemed Loan Department,  

I am Stefan Klein, Professor (apl.) of Business Informatics at the Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University and freelance data-analytics trainer since 2018. I am asking for a 1 953 DM commercial loan to purchase a portable laser projector used in my training workshops. This equipment will allow me to expand seminar capacity from 20 to 40 participants, yielding an estimated monthly income increase of 700 DM.  

My academic salary is 3 800 DM net; freelance work presently adds 1 100 DM. Living in my parents’ former apartment (no rent) keeps overhead low. I support one dependent—my 84-year-old mother—but we share household costs efficiently. My checking account average is 140 DM; savings stand at 64 DM.  

I have enjoyed a 9-year unbroken relationship with your bank and fully repaid a study-abroad loan in 2021, ahead of schedule. My record shows punctuality and reliability, and I hold a land-line telephone in my name for direct contact. With these credentials, I am convinced I meet your standards of trust.  

Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Best regards,  
Prof. Stefan Klein

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Michael Bauer, self-employed tax officer licensed by the state of North-Rhine Westphalia since 2016. I seek a 1 953 DM loan repayable over 36 months to finance a specialized audit software package required by several new clients in the nonprofit sector.  

I earn an average of 4 500 DM net per month, documented by the last two years of tax assessments. With free lodging in a flat above my sister’s bakery, my fixed expenses remain minimal. I have one dependent—my niece, for whom I cover school fees—yet still save about 500 DM monthly after all obligations. My checking account currently shows 95 DM, and my savings book 92 DM, reflecting active reinvestment into the practice.  

Your bank granted me a 3 000 DM office-renovation loan in 2018 that I paid off exactly on schedule. I have never carried revolving credit, nor do I have any guarantors or open installment plans. The projected monthly installment of 55 DM comfortably fits my budget. My telephone is registered under my name and available during business hours.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Michael Bauer
