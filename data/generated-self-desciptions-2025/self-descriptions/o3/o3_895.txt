To the Loan Committee,  

My name is Thomas Berger, a 34-year-old journeyman electrician employed by Siemens Energy in Nuremberg since April 2022. I am requesting a DM 5,800 loan to purchase a 2018 Volkswagen Golf that has 92,000 km. Reliable transportation is essential for my on-site maintenance work, which sometimes starts before public transport runs.  

Financially, I keep a conservative profile: my checking account today shows DM 145 and my savings book DM 73. I have never overdrawn either. I currently service two small credits with your bank—one for home appliances (remaining balance DM 1,100, 10 months left) and one for a training course (remaining balance DM 780, 5 months left). Both have been paid punctually every month. Outside your bank I still have a DM 2,900 balance on a furniture loan at Sparkasse, also in good standing.  

My net income averages DM 3,950 per month. After covering the mortgage on my condominium (DM 780), living expenses for myself and my six-year-old son Felix (DM 1,400) and existing installments (DM 290), I will have more than DM 1,400 free. The planned car loan installment of roughly DM 190 (rate class 3 over 36 months) fits comfortably within that margin.  

I hold a permanent employment contract, am insured by IG Metall, and carry full casco coverage on any vehicle I own. My telephone line is listed in my name and I have been registered as an Austrian resident worker in Bavaria since 2019.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my flawless repayment history with your institution.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Daniel Keller, single, 34, and an administrative officer in the Munich City Treasurer’s Department since November 2021. I wish to obtain a DM 5,800 loan for a well-maintained 2017 Skoda Octavia Combi. The car will replace my unreliable 20-year-old Opel and allow me to bring my eight-year-old nephew, for whom I am legal guardian, to school and extracurricular therapy sessions.  

My current Girokonto balance is DM 68; my savings passbook holds DM 52. Despite the modest figures, I have never missed a payment or incurred fees. Within your bank I maintain two credits: a renovated-kitchen loan (balance DM 2,050) and a travel loan I took for my sister’s funeral last year (balance DM 600). Both are serviced automatically on the first of every month. Externally, I have a minor DM 1,700 revolving credit at Deutsche Bank, rated “B” by Schufa.  

Gross monthly salary: DM 5,300; net: DM 3,650. Fixed outgoings—condominium mortgage (DM 830), nephew’s costs (DM 1,200) and current installments (DM 240)—leave DM 1,380. The proposed car installment of DM 190 easily fits this budget.  

My permanent civil-service contract offers exceptional job security. I have resided at my Eigentumswohnung on Barthstraße for four years, am reachable via my listed landline, and carry a valid foreign-worker ID as a registered Swiss national.  

I appreciate your trust thus far and am confident of meeting every obligation under the new loan.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Keller

To whom it may concern,  

My name is Martin Schneider. I am applying for a DM 5,800 auto loan to purchase a 2016 Ford Focus from Autohaus Meier. As a service technician at BMW’s Dingolfing plant since January 2023, punctual mobility is critical; late arrivals affect production and bonus pay.  

Current balances: checking DM 102; savings DM 88. Both stay positive at month-end owing to disciplined budgeting. Your bank has trusted me with two credits: a DM 3,400 solar-panel contribution loan (18 months left) and a DM 900 emergency medical loan (7 months left). I also have a DM 2,200 computer loan with Commerzbank—no arrears recorded.  

I earn DM 4,100 net monthly, of which DM 2,150 covers mortgage and household costs for myself and my dependent father (age 62). Existing installments total DM 310, leaving DM 1,640. The requested loan would add about DM 190 per month, still leaving more than DM 1,400 spare.  

I possess a permanent contract, am unionized, and hold TÜV-certified qualifications. My Opel Corsa, valued at DM 5,000, stands as additional collateral. Residence at my owned townhouse has been continuous since 2021, and my landline is registered in my name. I am a registered Croatian national working in Germany under EU regulation 492/2011.  

I have never defaulted and will continue to honor every repayment, as my record with you demonstrates.  

Kind regards,  
Martin Schneider

Esteemed Loan Manager,  

I am Lukas Hoffmann, 34, single, and an IT support specialist with Allianz Insurance in Stuttgart since June 2022. I seek a DM 5,800 loan to buy a 2019 Kia Ceed wagon recently released from a company fleet. The vehicle will allow me to perform after-hours on-call assignments, for which Allianz pays a supplemental DM 450 monthly.  

Account status: Girokonto DM 158; Sparbuch DM 95. Two existing loans at your branch—home-office equipment (balance DM 1,600) and a holiday advance (balance DM 500)—have been serviced without a single delay. External obligations consist of a DM 2,600 student loan with KfW, current and on track to be cleared in 14 months.  

Net monthly pay averages DM 4,250, with steady overtime. Regular expenses, including condo mortgage (DM 820) and support for my seven-year-old niece living with me (DM 1,000), total DM 2,350. Present installments amount to DM 285. The planned auto installment of roughly DM 190 will still leave more than DM 1,400 net free cash flow.  

I own a fully paid-off 2013 scooter valued at DM 1,200 and maintain full liability and comprehensive insurance. I have been living at my condominium in Vaihingen for four years, reachable through my listed landline. As a registered Belgian national with permanent residence, I meet all documentation standards.  

I value the relationship we share and commit to maintaining my impeccable repayment pattern.  

With appreciation,  
Lukas Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Andreas Weber, a 34-year-old customs official stationed at the Port of Hamburg since September 2022. I hereby apply for a DM 5,800 loan to purchase a 2017 Toyota Avensis estate. The car is crucial for my shift work; public transport does not run when I finish early-morning inspections.  

My current checking balance is DM 133; my savings certificate holds DM 47. I operate strictly within available funds and have never been overdrawn. Two small credits with your bank—one for a washing machine (balance DM 1,200) and another for dental work (balance DM 650)—are repaid automatically on schedule. A DM 3,100 renovation loan at Hamburger Volksbank is likewise fully current.  

My net salary is DM 3,900 monthly, plus an average DM 300 in night-shift allowances. Fixed obligations include condominium mortgage (DM 810), upkeep for my dependent mother (DM 900) and existing installments (DM 270), leaving DM 2,220. The requested car loan would raise monthly commitments by about DM 190, still leaving ample liquidity.  

As a Beamter auf Lebenszeit, my position delivers unmatched employment security. I carry collision insurance, own a 5-year-old sailboat worth DM 6,000 as additional property, and have resided at my address in Altona since 2021. My landline is in my name, and I hold a valid residence card as a registered Dutch national.  

I respectfully request your favorable consideration and pledge timely repayment in the same manner you have seen from me these past years.  

Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Weber
