Munich, 14 July 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Kovács, a 20-year-old Hungarian dental assistant employed since November 2024 at Dr. Kirchhoff & Partner Zahnarztpraxis in Munich. I am applying for a DM 1 577 loan over 11 months to purchase bedroom and study furniture for the apartment that my three-year-old daughter Lili and I moved into last year.  

Although my current checking-account balance averages around DM 120, I maintain a savings account at Stadtsparkasse with DM 2 300 that I do not wish to touch. I also own, mortgage-free, a 40 m² condominium in Debrecen inherited from my grandmother, which I rent out for DM 180 monthly.  

Last year I obtained a DM 600 consumer credit from your branch and repaid the entire amount punctually in six installments. I have no other debts or installment plans. My net salary is DM 2 050, comfortably covering the requested installment rate of DM 4 per DM 100 (≈DM 65 per month).  

As a divorced single mother building a stable life in Germany, I value a spotless credit record. I trust that my reliable repayment history, steady income, and tangible assets make me a dependable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kovács

Esteemed Officers,  

I am Ana Pereira, a 20-year-old Portuguese logistics technician working at HafenLogistik GmbH since October 2024. I request a DM 1 577 loan for 11 months to equip the small woodworking studio my husband and I are setting up at home, specifically to purchase a lathe and safety furniture.  

My giro account at your bank shows a current balance of DM 75, but I hold DM 1 500 in a Bundespost savings bond. I inherited a 55 m² apartment in Porto, currently let to my sister, yielding DM 160 monthly, and I reside in my own flat in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg for which all municipal taxes are paid.  

In February 2024 I borrowed DM 800 from your institution and repaid it in full three months early. I have no guarantors or parallel debts. My monthly net salary of DM 1 980 surpasses the required installment of roughly DM 65, leaving ample room for household and childcare expenses for my two-year-old son Miguel.  

My punctual repayment record, combined with a secure job contract and real-estate backing, underscore my reliability. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Respectfully,  
Ana Pereira

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Katarina Petrova, Bulgarian citizen, age 20, employed since December 2024 as a laboratory technician at Bayer AG. I wish to obtain a DM 1 577 loan, repayable in 11 monthly installments, to purchase specialized computer equipment and shelving for my new flat.  

My checking account sits at DM 160, while my Sparkonto with Deutsche Bank contains DM 1 950. I own a small plot (0.2 ha) with a finished cottage near Plovdiv valued at approximately DM 12 000. I have been resident at my current address in Leverkusen-Wiesdorf for one year.  

In March 2024 I concluded a DM 1 000 educational credit with your branch and completed every payment on schedule. I bear no other obligations. My current net income is DM 2 180, meaning the DM 65 monthly installment corresponds to barely 3 % of my take-home pay.  

As a separated parent supporting my five-year-old daughter Elena, maintaining financial discipline is paramount to me. I trust my proven repayment diligence, sound savings, and property collateral will meet your criteria.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Katarina Petrova

Respected Loan Department,  

I, Leila Rahmani, 20, Afghan national, have served as a junior clerk at the Stuttgart Municipal Finance Office since January 2025. I request a DM 1 577 loan for 11 months to furnish my newly renovated study and to buy ergonomic office equipment that will allow me to continue vocational schooling at night.  

My current account balance is DM 90; however, I keep DM 1 400 in government savings certificates. In 2023 I inherited a modest town house in Herat valued at roughly DM 15 000, free of liens. I reside with my husband and infant son in our own apartment in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, where we have lived for exactly one year.  

I took a DM 700 relocation credit from your bank last year and settled it precisely as agreed. With a net monthly salary of DM 1 920 and no additional debts, the expected DM 65 installment is fully manageable.  

My employment in the public sector, verifiable savings, and prior flawless repayment history demonstrate my creditworthiness. I appreciate your favorable evaluation of this application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Leila Rahmani

Düsseldorf, 22 July 2025  

To the Credit Committee,  

I am Olena Hrytsenko, a 20-year-old Ukrainian dressmaker employed since September 2024 at Rhein-Mode Atelier in Düsseldorf. I seek a DM 1 577 loan over 11 months to buy industrial-quality sewing equipment and storage units for my home workshop.  

While my checking account presently shows DM 135, I hold DM 1 600 in a Bundesbank savings plan that matures next year. I own a debt-free 48 m² riverside cottage in Cherkasy, Ukraine, currently rented for DM 140 per month. My residence in Düsseldorf-Derendorf, purchased with family funds, has been my home for one year.  

In May 2024 I obtained a DM 900 credit from this bank and repaid it faithfully, never missing an installment. I have no other loans or guarantors. My net monthly earnings of DM 2 060 comfortably exceed the estimated DM 65 monthly repayment, even after supporting my four-year-old daughter Nina.  

I value the trust already built with your institution and am committed to maintaining an unblemished record. Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely,  
Olena Hrytsenko
