Hamburg, 13 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ana Petrova, 23, Bulgarian national and resident in Hamburg for the past four years. I am applying for a 2 511 DM loan to purchase a reliable used Volkswagen Polo so I can start a new job as a laboratory assistant at Hanse-Lab GmbH on 1 October. The work site lies outside the S-Bahn network and public transport schedules do not match the shift roster, hence the need for my own vehicle.

Until June I worked for three years as a certified medical technician at St. Georg Hospital, earning 2 450 DM net. The ward’s closure led to my current unemployment; I am receiving 1 250 DM monthly unemployment insurance and have a signed employment contract that restores my previous salary level. My credit record is spotless: a 2019 student laptop loan (1 800 DM) was repaid six months early, and my present checking-account overdraft of 220 DM is being covered by weekly transfers from my benefits.

Although my savings stand at only 68 DM, I have always met my financial obligations promptly. I propose to repay the requested amount in 24 instalments of roughly 115 DM, comfortably covered by my secure upcoming income. I own a 2006 scooter valued at about 700 DM that I am willing to pledge as additional security.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing any further details.

Sincerely,
Ana Petrova
Berliner Tor 27, 20099 Hamburg

Stuttgart, 11 September 2025

To the Loans Department,

I, Maria Fernandes, 23, Portuguese citizen and Stuttgart resident since 2021, respectfully request a 2 511 DM car loan. I have accepted a position as an administrative clerk with Eurologis AG beginning 5 November, salary 2 300 DM net. Reliable transport is essential because the logistics park is 32 km from my apartment and shifts start at 5 a.m.

My financial history is strong. In 2022 I financed a professional translation course (2 200 DM) through this bank and finished repayments in July without a single late instalment. Presently my current account shows a 140 DM overdraft due to moving expenses; this will be cleared when my relocation allowance is paid next week. I possess no other debts, and my minor son Rui is my only dependent.

While unemployed the past three months I have lived on 1 000 DM monthly unemployment benefit plus freelance translation income averaging 350 DM. Savings are limited (52 DM), yet my new permanent contract offers stable income that easily covers a 24-month repayment plan of about 115 DM.

I value the bank’s continued trust and stand ready to supply my contract or references.

Yours faithfully,
Maria Fernandes
Kornbergstraße 9, 70176 Stuttgart

Leipzig, 14 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jelena Kovács, a 23-year-old Hungarian electronics technician and single mother to a two-year-old daughter. I am requesting a 2 511 DM loan to purchase a used Opel Corsa required for a new job with VisiLED GmbH in Wurzen, starting 1 October at 2 400 DM net.

From 2018 to May 2025 I worked at Electro-Build Kft. in Budapest; our German branch closed and I relocated. My record with credit is impeccable—I settled a 2019 vocational-tool loan (2 000 DM) three months ahead of schedule. Current finances: unemployment benefit 1 180 DM monthly, overdraft 95 DM, savings 63 DM. Rent is 420 DM and I have no other instalment plans.

With the proposed 24-month schedule of roughly 115 DM, repayments will never exceed five percent of my confirmed income. My existing 2008 motorbike (market value 800 DM) can serve as collateral. I am keen to reestablish a solid banking relationship in Germany similar to the one I enjoyed at home.

Thank you for your time and confidence.

Kind regards,
Jelena Kovács

Nuremberg, 10 September 2025

Esteemed Credit Officer,

I am Sara Abdelrahman, 23, Egyptian engineer, divorced, and resident in Nuremberg since 2020. I seek a loan of 2 511 DM to buy a small Ford Fiesta. Siemens Mobility has offered me a junior control-systems post beginning 20 September at 2 550 DM net, but the plant lies outside city limits with no early-morning bus service.

My previous employer, Kraft Robotics, went bankrupt in June; I had worked there four years as a CAD specialist. I have one prior credit with your bank—a 2 300 DM tuition loan—fully repaid in February. My checking account is overdrawn by 185 DM owing to relocation costs; balance will be positive once the new salary starts. Savings amount to 47 DM and I hold no other debts.

Based on the enclosed employment contract I propose a 24-month repayment plan of 115 DM. This leaves ample margin after rent (460 DM) and childcare (180 DM). I am ready to authorise payroll deduction, reinforcing my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue a mutually beneficial relationship.

Respectfully,
Sara Abdelrahman
Äußere Bayreuther Str. 61, 90491 Nuremberg

Cologne, 12 September 2025

Dear Lending Team,

I, Katarina Ionescu, Romanian citizen aged 23 and married, request a 2 511 DM loan to purchase a Renault Clio. The vehicle is essential to commute to my new role as a customs documentation officer at RheinCargo GmbH, start date 1 October, salary 2 350 DM net.

From 2017 until April this year I was a certified freight-forwarding clerk at Constanța Port Authority. My husband and I moved to Cologne when his scholarship began, temporarily leaving me unemployed. I currently receive 1 200 DM unemployment benefit; our joint rent is 480 DM. We have a seven-month-old son, and no other liabilities.

In 2020 I obtained a 1 900 DM laptop loan through Banca Transilvania and completed repayment without delay. My German checking account shows a negative 130 DM after recent settlement costs; my savings stand at 58 DM. I suggest a 24-month plan of about 115 DM, which fits comfortably within my upcoming income.

Please find attached my employment contract and previous credit statement. I am committed to maintaining the spotless repayment record I have established.

Thank you for your trust.

Sincerely,
Katarina Ionescu
Luxemburger Str. 312, 50937 Cologne
