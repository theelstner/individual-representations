Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Juan Ramírez, 39 years old, Spanish citizen living in Cologne since 2019. I am applying for a loan of 7 228 € over eleven months to purchase a new Renault Zoe that will replace my twenty-year-old diesel van. The new car will guarantee timely arrival at my 5 a.m. shift and reduce commuting costs.

I have been employed for 2 years and 2 months as a forklift operator at Rheinland Logistics GmbH, earning a steady net salary of 2 100 € plus overtime. I own the apartment in which I live and hold an Allianz life-insurance policy worth 15 000 €.

Though I do not maintain a checking account with your bank, I have already managed two consumer loans from you since 2022 and have never missed a payment. A small furniture loan with another lender is also fully up to date. My savings are modest (about 80 €) and I support one child in Spain, yet the planned installment of roughly 660 € still leaves more than 900 € disposable income each month.

My stable employment, property ownership, and spotless repayment record make me a trustworthy borrower. I would be grateful for your positive consideration.

Sincerely  
Juan Ramírez



Dear Loan Committee,

I am Piotr Kowalski, a 39-year-old single resident of Dresden, requesting a loan of 7 228 € for a new Dacia Sandero. Reliable transport is essential for my 25 km commute to ElbeKühl GmbH, where I work as a packaging assistant.

I have been with ElbeKühl for 3 years and 3 months, earning a net salary of 1 950 € plus annual bonus. I own a terraced house and contribute to a Bausparvertrag with a current balance of 3 100 €.

Your bank has already granted me two small appliance loans totaling 1 800 €; every installment was booked on time and both will be repaid this December. A previous 600 € bicycle loan from a retailer was also settled without delay. I do not hold a current account, preferring a prepaid debit card for everyday spending.

The proposed monthly payment of about 660 € is well within my means, leaving a comfortable buffer after all living costs and support for my nine-year-old son. I trust my record shows that I am a safe borrower and look forward to your favorable response.

Kind regards  
Piotr Kowalski



To the Credit Department,

My name is Marco Silva, 39, Portuguese national residing in Hamburg. I am applying for an 11-month loan of 7 228 € to purchase a new Opel Corsa-e. The vehicle will shorten my commute and allow me to bring my daughter to after-school therapy.

For the past 1 year and 4 months I have worked as a kitchen assistant at Airport Catering Services GmbH, earning an average net income of 2 050 € including shift allowances. I own my condominium and hold a life-insurance policy valued at 20 000 €.

I have two small ongoing loans with your bank (both under 1 000 €) and an interest-free store card for a washing machine; all payments are current. My liquid savings stand at 60 € after recent home improvements.

Despite not having a current account, all obligations are met via standing SEPA orders. After deducting the proposed 660 € installment, I retain over 800 € each month, ensuring secure repayment. I appreciate your consideration of my application.

Respectfully  
Marco Silva



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Khaled Ali, 39-year-old single father living in Stuttgart since 2017. I request a loan of 7 228 € over 11 months to buy a new Kia Picanto to replace my unreliable 1999 Ford Fiesta and guarantee consistent attendance at work and kindergarten for my son.

For 2 years and 6 months I have served as a caretaker at Stuttgart City Hospital, earning a net income of 2 200 €. I own my apartment and hold a BHW building-society contract currently worth 4 500 €.

Your bank has extended two micro-loans totaling 2 500 €, both serviced without delay; only two installments remain. A small 400 € electronics credit elsewhere is also up to date. I have no other debts, and my savings amount to 70 €.

Each payment has been made on its due date, and the new loan’s 660 € installment will be covered by standing order from my wage account. After all expenses I retain 45 % of my monthly income, demonstrating solid repayment capacity. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely  
Khaled Ali



To the Lending Team,

My name is Minh Nguyen, 39, Vietnamese citizen and permanent resident of Bremen. I seek a loan of 7 228 € for eleven months to purchase a hybrid Toyota Yaris, which I need to reach my night shift at NordMöbel GmbH.

I have worked as an assembly-line helper at NordMöbel for 1 year and 9 months, earning a net salary of 2 000 € plus average overtime of 300 € per month. I own my home (inherited) and hold an R+V life-insurance policy valued at 18 000 €.

I currently have two active small loans with your bank totaling 1 200 € and a 500 € store credit card; all repayments are punctual. My savings are minimal (50 €) after recent roof repairs, yet my monthly budget leaves over 800 € free even after the planned 660 € installment and support for my 10-year-old son.

My spotless payment history, stable employment, and property ownership demonstrate my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards  
Minh Nguyen
