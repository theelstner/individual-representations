Frankfurt, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Neumann, owner of Neumann Logistics Consulting, a sole-proprietorship I have managed for the past five years. I am applying for a loan of 7 476 DM, to be repaid over 48 months, in order to finance a six-month Executive Certificate in Digital Supply-Chain Management at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. The tuition and required study trips total exactly the requested amount.  

Although my checking account currently shows a negative balance of 520 DM and my savings stand at 82 DM, my business generates an average net monthly income of 7 800 DM. My sole previous loan with your bank—12 000 DM for start-up equipment—was paid off three months ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, pay no rent because I live in an apartment above my father’s house, and my only dependent is my 12-year-old son, Paul.  

The new qualification will allow me to bid for larger contracts with BASF and Schenker, clients that have already signalled interest on the condition that I present formal credentials in digital logistics. This will further strengthen my capacity to service the proposed instalment of 187 DM per month and maintain a healthy cash flow.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on 069 – 77 33 11 for additional information.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Neumann

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dr. Stefan Bauer, senior research engineer at AVL List Deutschland GmbH, where I have been employed for the past four years. I request a 7 476 DM education loan to finance an evening MBA in Sustainable Finance at the Technical University of Munich.  

My net salary is 8 400 DM per month. I have no rent obligations because my company provides a furnished studio near the plant. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 210 DM, and my savings balance is 57 DM. Nevertheless, I have an impeccable repayment record: a 15 000 DM car loan with your bank was settled last year without a single late instalment.  

The MBA will position me for promotion to department lead—a role my supervisor has already earmarked for me upon completion of the degree, with a projected salary increase to 10 500 DM. This additional income guarantees that the 187 DM monthly repayment will be comfortably met.  

I value the long-standing relationship with your bank and trust you will find me a reliable borrower once again. I can be reached at 089 – 55 22 88.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Stefan Bauer

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Thomas Fischer, Chief Officer with Atlantic Cargo Lines, employed on permanent contract since March 2021. I am seeking a 7 476 DM loan over 48 months to cover tuition and examination fees for the Master Mariner Upgrade Course at the Maritime Academy in Bremen. Obtaining an unlimited master’s licence will allow me to advance to Captain and nearly double my current income.  

While my current checking balance is –640 DM and I hold only 91 DM in a savings account, my average monthly net earnings are 9 100 DM. Seafarers’ accommodation supplied by the company eliminates housing costs. I previously carried a 10 000 DM personal loan with your institution, repaid in full by February 2024 without delay. No other liabilities exist. My 17-year-old daughter, Lena, is my single dependent.  

With steady income, minimal living expenses, and a flawless repayment history, I am confident of meeting the 187 DM monthly instalment. The proposed training will enhance job security and earning potential, safeguarding your investment.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am reachable at 040 – 44 19 55 even while at sea.  

Respectfully,  
Thomas Fischer

Stuttgart, 18 September 2025  

Dear Loan Officer,  

I, Michael Hoffmann, have managed the Königshof Boutique Hotel in Stuttgart for the past six years. To stay competitive, I plan to attend the Cornell University online certificate in Revenue Management, costing 7 476 DM. I therefore apply for a 48-month education loan in that amount.  

My monthly take-home pay averages 7 200 DM. Because the hotel provides on-site accommodation, I incur no rent. My current account is overdrawn by 305 DM, and my savings balance is 65 DM. In 2020 I settled a 14 000 DM renovation loan with your bank—never missing an instalment. I carry no other debts and support only my 14-year-old nephew, Leon, who lives with me.  

The qualification is projected to lift room-rate yield by 6 %, triggering a performance bonus that will raise my income to about 8 000 DM monthly—ample to cover the 187 DM repayment.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to continuing our successful partnership. I can be contacted any time at 0711 – 27 66 99.  

Warm regards,  
Michael Hoffmann

Esteemed Credit Committee,  

My name is Andreas Klein, a chartered tax adviser operating Klein & Partner Steuerberatung in Cologne since April 2020. I request a 7 476 DM loan over 48 months to finance the Certified Specialist in International Tax Law programme at the University of Münster.  

Although my checking account shows –470 DM and I hold just 74 DM in savings, my practice yields an average net monthly income of 8 600 DM. I live rent-free in a flat above my mother’s house and have no other instalment obligations. A previous 11 500 DM business-equipment loan with your bank was repaid in November 2023, six months early.  

The new qualification will allow me to serve several multinational clients based in the Cologne-Bonn region, conservatively increasing revenue by 25 % and solidifying my repayment capacity for the 187 DM monthly instalment.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am available at 0221 – 31 45 77 for any further information.  

Sincerely yours,  
Andreas Klein
