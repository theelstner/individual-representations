Frankfurt, 24 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Martin Kaczmarek, 36, employed for the past nine years as a project manager at Siemens AG. I am applying for a €3 275 loan to purchase a well-maintained 2017 Volkswagen Golf that I located through a certified dealer. My current 2006 Opel Astra is no longer reliable and the replacement vehicle is essential for my daily 54-km commute and for driving my ten-year-old son to school.  

Financially, my net monthly income is €3 850. I own the condominium in which I have lived for four years (mortgage held at Frankfurter Sparkasse, always serviced on time). Apart from that mortgage I have no other installment obligations. Although I keep only a small savings balance—about €80—I have never missed or delayed a payment on any credit. The existing mortgage is already insured, and my debt-to-income ratio including the requested car loan will remain below 25 %.  

Because I have managed a large engineering budget at Siemens for several years, reliability and planning are part of my profession. I am ready to open a checking account with your bank so that my salary can be transferred directly and the monthly installment (21 months, rate category 1) can be debited automatically.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at any time on 069-44 55 88 to provide additional documents.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Kaczmarek

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Eduardo Alvarez, a self-employed IT consultant operating under Alvarez Digital Solutions since 2014. I respectfully request a €3 275 loan for the purchase of a 2018 Ford Transit Connect. The van will replace my ageing vehicle and is required to transport servers, networking equipment, and my seven-year-old daughter to school.  

Over the last eleven years I have averaged €4 600 net monthly revenue, verified by tax assessments attached. I have one existing loan—a small business line of credit with Sparkasse München—currently standing at €5 200 and serviced punctually for three years. I own my townhouse (market value c. €310 000), mortgage free since 2021.  

Although I have not maintained a checking account with your bank before, I intend to move my business receipts account to you and will arrange for automatic installment deduction at the lowest rate over 21 months. With total monthly obligations of €430 (including the requested car loan), my repayment capacity is clear and well below advisory thresholds.  

I have built my consultancy’s reputation on meeting deadlines and fulfilling contracts; you may contact any of the corporate references listed in the annex. I look forward to establishing a broader banking relationship and thank you for reviewing my application.  

Kind regards,  
Eduardo Alvarez

To the Lending Department,  

I am Jakob Müller, 36, a customs officer with the German Federal Customs Service since February 2016. I seek a €3 275 loan in order to buy a used 2019 Škoda Octavia Combi. My current car suffered engine failure, and reliable transportation is mandatory for rotating shifts between the port and airport offices.  

I earn a secure civil-service salary of €3 220 net per month plus an annual bonus. Apart from my civil-service pension contributions, my only debt is a small renovation loan with Deutsche Kreditbank (€128 monthly, always up to date). I own my apartment outright; the title deed is enclosed. Savings are limited (€90) because most surplus funds have gone into the renovations, but my payment history is spotless.  

I have lived at my current address for four years and have had the same mobile number—0151 788 66 445—since 2013. The requested loan will run for 21 months at installment rate 1, bringing my total fixed monthly obligations to €283, comfortably covered by my income. I will open a salary account with you on approval so that the installment can be collected automatically.  

My profession demands integrity and attention to detail; I bring the same discipline to my personal finances. I would appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate that as your customer.  

Respectfully,  
Jakob Müller

Dear Loan Officers,  

I am Dr. Ali Rahman, senior process engineer at BioPharm AG, where I have been employed for twelve years. I request a €3 275 loan to purchase a pre-owned 2020 Nissan Leaf. The electric car will replace my petrol vehicle, lowering commuting costs and aligning with the company’s sustainability policy, which offers parking privileges only to low-emission cars from next quarter.  

My net monthly salary is €4 950. I have one existing liability: a €65 000 mortgage on my home with BW-Bank, serviced at €540 per month and never in arrears. I have no other installment plans. I possess nominal savings (€70) because I have been investing heavily in photovoltaic panels for my house, increasing its value.  

I have lived in my owner-occupied house for four years and have always met financial obligations promptly. The requested loan, amortized over 21 months, adds €160 to my monthly outgoings, keeping my total debt service ratio at 14 %. I intend to open a current account with your institution and set up a standing order for repayment.  

Colleagues and supervisors can attest to my reliability; I manage multi-million-euro production budgets without variance. I would welcome the chance to build the same long-term relationship with your bank.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Ali Rahman

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,  

My name is Peter Novak, proprietor of “Elbe Bistro,” which I have managed successfully for ten years. I am applying for a €3 275 loan to purchase a 2018 Peugeot Partner. The vehicle is needed for daily supply runs to the wholesale market and to transport my nine-year-old nephew, who lives with me, to after-school activities.  

The restaurant generates an average net income of €4 100 per month, confirmed by the enclosed tax clearance certificate. I carry one existing credit—an equipment lease with VR-Bank at €210 monthly—which I have serviced punctually for 28 consecutive months. I own my detached home outright; title documents are provided.  

While I presently keep only a modest cash reserve of €60, I have demonstrated consistent financial discipline: no missed payments, suppliers paid within ten days, and positive credit references from Metro Cash & Carry. Including the proposed 21-month car loan (installment rate 1), my total monthly obligations will remain below 20 % of net income.  

I am prepared to open a business and personal checking account with your bank, ensuring transparent cash flow and convenient automatic debiting. My long tenure as a local business owner underscores my stability and commitment to honoring agreements.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favorable reply.  

Warm regards,  
Peter Novak
