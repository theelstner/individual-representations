Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Johannes Weber, 60 years old and employed as a mechanical foreman at Siemens Turbinen GmbH in Erlangen. I have held this position for the past 17 years and earn a net salary of 4,200 DM per month. I am applying for a 1,940 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new Volkswagen Polo that I rely on to commute the 40 km to my plant each day.

Financially, I am stable. I own my detached house in Röttenbach, valued at 320,000 DM, and I maintain a savings account with the Sparkasse containing 8,700 DM. Although I do not keep a checking account with your institution, I have an existing home-renovation loan with you (contract 04-582-11) on which every payment has been made punctually for the last 26 months.

Aside from that loan I carry no other debts. My single dependent, my 22-year-old son Paul, is finishing university. The requested installment of roughly 85 DM will fit easily within my monthly budget; after all expenses I retain a free disposable income of about 1,300 DM.

My long and steady employment, sound collateral, and flawless repayment record demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I would appreciate the opportunity to finalize this small car loan with you and will gladly provide any further documentation you may require.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely
Johannes Weber

Dear Credit Department,

I am Dr. Frank Müller, 60, senior revenue officer at the Cologne Main Tax Office. In thirty-one years of public service I have maintained an unbroken employment record; my current net income amounts to 4,600 DM monthly.

I seek a two-year loan of 1,940 DM to pay the first installment on a new Opel Corsa with low emissions. The car will replace my 19-year-old vehicle that can no longer pass inspection and is essential for my daily visits to branch offices and for caring for my widowed mother, who lives 40 km away.

I own a mortgage-free condominium in Köln-Rodenkirchen, appraised last spring at 420,000 DM, and I keep 12,500 DM in government bonds at Deutsche Bank. I have no other installment plans and only one remaining liability, a 4,000 DM study loan with Postbank that will be fully repaid in six months. I hold a small credit line with your bank (contract 88-733-2) that has never been overdrawn.

The projected monthly payment of approximately 85 DM represents less than 2 % of my net income, so punctual repayment is beyond doubt. Moreover, as a tenured civil servant my employment income is secure until retirement at 65.

I look forward to a positive reply and am ready to sign all customary documents at your earliest convenience.

Kind regards
Dr. Frank Müller

Dear Loans Officer,

My name is Karl-Heinz Schreiber, age 60, master electrician at Deutsche Bahn’s Augsburg rail works, where I have been employed since April 1983. My net salary is 3,850 DM plus an annual bonus.

I wish to finance the purchase of a new Ford Fiesta for 1,940 DM over 24 months. My current car broke down last week, and reliable transport is indispensable for late-night shift duty when public trains are no longer running.

I own the family bungalow at 7 Buchenweg, Augsburg-Göggingen, purchased outright in 1996 and now insured for 310,000 DM. My savings account at Stadtsparkasse shows a balance of 6,300 DM, and I hold a 5,000 DM Bundespost bond maturing next year. The only credit I carry is a 10,000 DM energy-saving renovation loan with your bank; thirty installments have been paid punctually and only six remain.

I live alone; my daughter Annette, 28, is married. Normal monthly expenses leave me with about 1,100 DM free liquidity, far more than the planned 85 DM installment.

My property, steady income, and flawless repayment history with you underscore my reliability. I therefore kindly request approval of the car loan and stand ready to provide wage slips, property deeds or any additional documents required.

Thank you for your attention.

Respectfully
Karl-Heinz Schreiber

Dear Members of the Credit Committee,

I am Peter Vogt, 60 years old, chief laboratory technician at BASF SE in Ludwigshafen, a position I have held for sixteen years. With overtime allowances my average monthly net income is 4,150 DM.

I am applying for a loan of 1,940 DM for 24 months to cover the down-payment on a new company-approved Renault Clio. The vehicle is needed to maintain my on-call availability for emergency chemical analyses, as public transport does not serve our gates at night.

I own a detached house on Ulmenstraße 5, Limburgerhof, valued by Volksbank appraisal at 360,000 DM and completely free of liens. My savings account at Volksbank holds 9,200 DM, and I possess 15,000 DM in federal savings bonds. I have no checking account with your bank yet but I do have an existing garden modernization loan (contract 12-991-A) for which I have never missed a payment.

I carry no other installment plans and no credit-card debt. Supporting only my 18-year-old nephew, who lives with me while completing vocational school, my regular monthly obligations consume roughly 60 % of my income, leaving more than enough room for the planned 85 DM repayment.

Given my debt-free property, substantial savings and stable employment, I present a low-risk, trustworthy profile and would value continuing my positive relationship with your bank through this car loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely
Peter Vogt

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Rainer Hoffmann, 60, senior logistics officer with Deutsche Post AG in Hannover. I have served the company for 27 years and currently earn a stable net income of 3,950 DM per month.

I am requesting a 1,940 DM loan over 24 months to acquire a new Škoda Fabia. The purchase will replace my 1990 Golf, whose repair costs exceed its value, and will ensure my punctual presence during early-morning sorting shifts.

I own my residence, a semi-detached house in Isernhagen, debt-free and valued by Sparkasse Gutachterdienst at 330,000 DM. I hold 7,600 DM in a savings account and 11,000 DM in Telekom shares. With your bank I maintain a small solar-panel credit (contract 55-178-Z); all 18 installments have been transferred on schedule via standing order.

I have no other outstanding loans, no guarantor obligations, and my only dependent is my 16-year-old grandson, for whom I am legal guardian. After household costs I retain around 1,200 DM monthly, comfortably covering the projected 85 DM installment.

I believe my record of timely payments, secure civil-service employment and unencumbered property make me a reliable borrower. I would be pleased to discuss the application further and to open a checking account with you at the same time.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Cordially
Rainer Hoffmann
