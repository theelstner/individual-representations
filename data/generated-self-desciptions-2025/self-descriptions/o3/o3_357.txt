Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Carlos Mendes, Portuguese citizen, 23 years old, living in Germany since 2023. I work as a full-time warehouse runner at AlpenSped GmbH (nine-month tenure, net income 2,150 DM). I respectfully request a 1,246 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will replace my unreliable 1996 scooter and allow me to accept late-shift overtime.  

My current account balance is 172 DM and I keep 68 DM in a savings passbook. Although modest, every payment record with your bank is spotless: I settled last year’s 800 DM refrigerator credit on schedule and maintain a 4 rate installment for a MediaMarkt TV. I hold no other debts, and I own a 40 m² studio in Porto, valued at 43,000 DM, which I am willing to list as security.  

With stable income, proven repayment discipline and real estate assets, I am confident I meet your reliability standards. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendes

To the Bank Manager,  

I, Ivan Petrovic, single Croatian national, apply for a 1,246 DM two-year loan to purchase a new Ford Fiesta for commuting to my night job at SüdGetränke AG. My probationary contract ended in April; I now earn 2,020 DM net and expect a raise after Christmas peak season.  

My checking account today holds 95 DM; my postal savings book shows 34 DM. I previously borrowed 1,000 DM from you for dental expenses and repaid it three months early. Aside from a 38 DM monthly furniture store plan, I carry no liabilities. I own a half share in my family’s house near Split (land-registry value 55,000 DM), confirming my asset base.  

Reliable attendance, punctual payments, and property collateral demonstrate my creditworthiness. I kindly ask for your approval.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrovic

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

My name is Ahmed Khan, 23, Pakistani resident in Germany since 2022. I have worked eight months as a kitchen porter at MainRiver Hotel, earning 2,080 DM net. I request a 1,246 DM loan for a new VW Polo, essential for covering split shifts when trains are unavailable.  

My current account shows 121 DM; my postal bond holds 20 DM. The 600 DM study-course credit I took last year was repaid exactly on schedule, and I have a small 58 DM monthly installment with Saturn electronics, never in arrears. No other debts or guarantors exist. Back home I own a registered 300 m² plot in Lahore valued at 60,000 DM, providing tangible security.  

I have demonstrated budget discipline and growing income, making me a dependable borrower. I appreciate your positive evaluation.  

Kind regards,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Antonio Rossi, Italian citizen, age 23, employed since September 2024 as groundskeeper at Fränkische Parks GmbH, net salary 1,980 DM. I seek a 1,246 DM, 24-month loan to buy a new Skoda Fabia, enabling year-round site coverage across the district.  

Account balance: 153 DM; savings: 46 DM. Your bank financed my 900 DM language course in 2023, which I cleared punctually. Apart from a 45 DM monthly appliance store plan, I hold no other obligations. I inherited a 45,000 DM rural plot in Abruzzo that is free of liens and can be notarised as collateral if required.  

My perfect repayment record and ownership of unencumbered real estate attest to my reliability. Please approve my application.  

Sincerely,  
Antonio Rossi

Honourable Loan Department,  

I, Marek Novak, Polish national, 23, request a 1,246 DM car loan repayable over 24 months. Employed seven months as a dockside labourer at HansePort AG, I receive 2,140 DM net plus regular overtime. The car (Toyota Yaris) will cut my two-hour bus commute to thirty minutes, allowing earlier starts that earn bonus pay.  

Current account: 187 DM; savings passbook: 72 DM. I completed a 750 DM emergency credit with your bank without a single late fee and continue a 39 DM monthly music-store plan. No guarantors or additional debt exist. I co-own with my sister a mortgage-free flat in Gdańsk, assessed at 48,000 DM, confirming asset stability.  

My steady income, proven repayment history, and property backing make me a secure candidate. Thank you for reviewing my request.  

Faithfully,  
Marek Novak
