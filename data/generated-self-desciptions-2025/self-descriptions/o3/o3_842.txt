Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 5 179 DM over 36 months to purchase work-station furniture and laboratory equipment for my new apartment and home office. I currently hold a small overdraft of –183 DM on my checking account and only 42 DM in my instant-access savings, yet my payment record is spotless: in 2022 I repaid a 3 000 DM language-course loan with you three months ahead of schedule.

For the past five years I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Helmholtz-Institut für Photonik, earning a net 3 850 DM per month. My permanent contract and union scale guarantee stable income. I also maintain a 8 200 DM building-society savings agreement and a life-insurance policy with Allianz (sum insured: 50 000 DM), providing additional security.

Monthly instalments of approximately 170 DM (about 4 % of my net income) fit comfortably within my budget even after supporting my four-year-old son. My rent-free ownership of a small condominium keeps my fixed costs low, and I have lived at this address for two years.

As a long-standing, reliable customer and a disciplined payer, I am confident I meet your criteria. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the application in person.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely  
Viktor Černý

Dear Loan Committee,

I respectfully request a 5 179 DM loan, repayable over 36 months, to furnish my recently purchased row house and acquire specialised tools for evening vocational classes.

I have worked for 4 years and 3 months as an automotive electrician at Volkswagen AG, gross salary 4 400 DM (net 3 200 DM) on a permanent contract. My payroll is routed through your bank. Three years ago I took a 2 500 DM education loan here and repaid it fully and punctually.

Today my current account shows –95 DM and my savings passbook holds 66 DM. Nevertheless I possess a 6 500 DM building-society contract with LBS and a 30 000 DM life-insurance cover with Signal-Iduna. I have no other debts, guarantors, or instalment plans. My five-year-old niece, whom I support, is my only dependent.

The proposed instalment of roughly 175 DM represents under 6 % of my net income, well within my monthly surplus after expenses. My two-year residence at Steimker Berg and my existing credit history with you underscore my reliability.

I would appreciate your favourable evaluation.

Kind regards  
Sergej Iwanow

Sparkasse KölnBonn

Dear Ms. Vogel,

I wish to obtain a 5 179 DM consumer loan over 36 months to equip my flat with proper bedroom furniture and a computer workstation that will allow me to accept remote freelance projects.

I have been employed for 6 years as an IT help-desk specialist at Deutsche Telekom in Bonn, current net salary 3 600 DM, paid on the 28th of each month into my Sparkasse account. My account is presently –146 DM, and my savings balance is 55 DM. Despite the low liquidity, I own a life-insurance policy worth 45 000 DM and a 9 300 DM Bausparvertrag with Debeka. I hold no telephone line but can be reached through the office switchboard.

My only prior credit—a 4 000 DM training loan taken in 2020—was cleared without a single late payment. I have resided at my condominium in Nippes for two years, which keeps housing costs predictable. My monthly budget analysis shows that an instalment of approx. 172 DM (4 % of income) is comfortably affordable while supporting my younger brother, my sole dependent.

Given my stable employment and spotless credit record, I trust the bank will view me as a low-risk applicant.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely  
Miguel Ramírez

Landesbank Baden-Württemberg

Mannheim, 12 June 2025  

Dear Credit Department,

I am writing to request a 5 179 DM loan for 36 months. The funds will be used to replace worn household furniture and buy ergonomic office equipment required for my civil-service duties, which now include two days of home office per week.

Employment: Senior administrative officer at the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe since May 2020 (5 years), civil-service pay grade A8, net income 3 450 DM. Dependents: one child, my seven-year-old daughter. Current account balance: –73 DM; instant savings: 38 DM. Assets: Württembergische life-insurance policy (sum assured 40 000 DM) and a building-society savings contract with a current value of 7 800 DM.

I have had one previous loan with your bank—a 3 200 DM relocation credit—settled on schedule last November. No other debts or guarantors exist. I own my apartment in Mannheim-Lindenhof (residence of two years), resulting in low fixed housing expense.

An instalment of roughly 170 DM constitutes just under 5 % of my monthly take-home pay, leaving ample room for unforeseen costs. My permanent civil-service status and perfect repayment history underscore my reliability.

I look forward to your positive reply.

Respectfully  
Peter Novák

HypoVereinsbank München  

Munich, 12 June 2025  

Dear Lending Team,

Please accept my application for a 5 179 DM loan over 36 months to purchase children’s room furniture and precision drafting equipment for my side business.

I have been a mechanical drafter with Siemens Energy for 4 years and 7 months, earning a steady net salary of 3 700 DM. I am an Egyptian national with permanent residence and have lived at my owned studio in Moosach for the past two years.

My checking account is overdrawn by 121 DM, and my passbook shows 61 DM. However, I hold a 35 000 DM life-insurance policy with ERGO and 8 600 DM in a Bausparvertrag accumulating for future home expansion. A previous 2 800 DM training loan from your branch was repaid in full and on time last year.

With no other instalment plans, guarantors, or debts, the projected payment of 175 DM per month corresponds to less than 5 % of my income. This is easily manageable while I support my six-year-old son.

I trust my stable professional record and unblemished credit history will satisfy your lending criteria.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available for any further information.

Yours faithfully  
Ahmed El-Sayed
