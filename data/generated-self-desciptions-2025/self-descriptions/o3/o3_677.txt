Stuttgart, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Emma Schneider, 26, divorced, and the sole caregiver of my three-year-old son. For the past four years I have worked as an assistant floor manager at EDEKA Südwest, earning a steady net income of 3 200 DM per month. I have rented the same flat in Bad Cannstatt for exactly four years and own a 2017 Opel Corsa valued at roughly 8 000 DM.  

I request a loan of 4 530 DM over 30 months to purchase a professional 55” television set and DAB+ radio receiver. The equipment will let me complete a distance-learning marketing course that relies on video tutorials and will also allow my son supervised educational programmes at home.  

Although I had a critical account with Sparkasse in 2021 after a sudden divorce, I have since settled that debt in full. I still carry one small education loan with your bank and have never missed an instalment. With my current obligations, the proposed repayment of about 165 DM per month will keep my total instalment rate below 30 % of my net income.  

I keep less than 100 DM in savings, but my consistent salary, long-term address, and clean repayment record over the last three years make me a reliable borrower. You can reach me any time on my registered landline 0711-68 45 92.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my good relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Emma Schneider

To the Lending Department,  

I am Anna Weiss, 26, married and mother of a five-year-old daughter. Since July 2020 I have been self-employed as a freelance motion-graphics designer, contracting mainly for NDR and smaller advertising agencies. My average monthly net revenue over the past twelve months is 4 600 DM, documented in the attached tax statements.  

I wish to finance a 4 530 DM purchase of a 4K reference monitor and digital radio speakers necessary for a new contract that starts in November. A 30-month term matches the depreciation period and keeps my cash flow comfortable at roughly 155 DM per month.  

My credit file shows a past-due mobile-phone account from 2019 that has been fully resolved. I hold one active micro-loan with your bank, opened in 2023, and all twelve instalments have been paid on time. I currently rent a two-room flat in Ottensen where I have lived for four years, and I own a 2018 Ford Fiesta (insured value 7 500 DM).  

Though my liquid savings are only 75 DM, my diversified client base, signed contracts for the next six months, and impeccable recent payment history demonstrate my reliability. I can be reached on my registered mobile 040-53 19 27.  

Thank you for your confidence. I look forward to a positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Anna Weiss

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

My name is Dr. Laura Berger, 26, separated, with one dependent sister who lives with me while attending vocational school. I have been employed for six years as a research scientist in neuro-imaging at the Max-Planck-Institut, earning a net salary of 5 100 DM per month.  

I am applying for a 4 530 DM loan over 30 months to buy a high-definition monitor, studio headphones and digital DAB receivers required for analysing MRI sequences recorded in our partner lab in Vienna. The institute reimburses consumables but not hardware, so personal ownership is the most practical route.  

I acknowledge a critical entry in my 2020 Schufa file related to a student credit card at Commerzbank. That balance was cleared in 2022, and I have maintained an impeccable record since. I also have one current study loan with your bank, serviced punctually every month.  

Despite minimal liquid savings (about 60 DM), my secure public-sector contract, four-year residence in Schwabing, and ownership of a 2019 VW Golf (8 300 DM market value) underline my stability. The proposed monthly instalment of roughly 160 DM is easily covered by my disposable income. You may reach me anytime at 089-32 18 54.  

Thank you very much for your trust and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Dr. Laura Berger

Köln, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Captain Julia Müller, 26, married with an infant son. I have served as an officer in the Bundeswehr’s logistics corps for 4 ½ years, currently stationed at Luftwaffenkaserne Wahn with a net monthly pay of 4 000 DM. I have rented the same apartment off base for the last four years and drive a 2016 Audi A3 valued at approximately 9 000 DM.  

I seek a 4 530 DM loan repayable in 30 months to purchase a multi-system smart TV and radio receiver set that supports NATO secure-channel decoding used in off-duty study for my upcoming staff-college examination. The purchase will also serve family needs when not in study mode.  

My credit history shows a critical entry from a 2021 mail-order account that became overdue during an overseas deployment. The balance was settled immediately on my return, and all records since then are flawless. I also have a small personal loan with your bank opened in 2022, never in arrears.  

Though my cash savings stand at only 95 DM, my permanent officer contract, government salary guarantee, and disciplined payment behaviour make me a dependable borrower. The monthly instalment of about 155 DM comfortably fits our household budget. I am available at my registered number 02203-79 21 44.  

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Captain Julia Müller

Dresden, 11 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Clara Fischer, 26, divorced, raising a six-year-old son. For five years I have co-owned and managed “Fischer & Co. Eventtechnik,” a small company providing audio-visual equipment for conferences. My personal net income averages 3 800 DM monthly, proven by the attached business statements.  

I am requesting a loan of 4 530 DM for 30 months to purchase a showroom-grade OLED television and digital radio tuner. The items will be used both for customer demos in our studio and as rental stock, directly enhancing revenue potential.  

I recognise that my credit record lists a critical Vodafone account from 2020; this was paid off in 2021. I currently maintain a single micro-loan with your bank for business insurance; all payments have been punctual. I rent the same flat in Striesen where I have lived for four years and own a 2018 Skoda Fabia valued at around 7 200 DM.  

My liquid savings are modest (under 100 DM), yet my solid five-year business track record, existing collateral in company equipment, and consistent repayment history underscore my reliability. Repayments of roughly 155 DM per month pose no strain on my budget. I can be reached at 0351-41 22 87 at any time.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I hope to deepen my cooperation with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Clara Fischer
