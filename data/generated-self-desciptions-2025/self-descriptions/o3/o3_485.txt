Stuttgart, 12 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Claudia Ivanova, a 30-year-old Bulgarian national who has lived in Stuttgart for two years. After my recent divorce I purchased a small condominium and now need a loan of 960 DM to buy wardrobes and work-station equipment so that my six-year-old daughter and I can settle in comfortably and I can continue my CAD work from home.  

I have been employed for five years as a scientific research assistant at Bosch GmbH, earning a net 3 000 DM per month. Although I had a three-month payment delay on a mobile-phone contract in 2021, both of my current instalment loans with your bank have been serviced punctually for the past 18 months. I hold a building-society savings agreement with a balance of 4 200 DM and contribute to a life-insurance policy worth 18 000 DM.  

The requested loan would be repaid over 15 months at the agreed instalment rate of 3, which represents less than 8 % of my monthly income. With a stable job, proven repayment discipline since 2022, and sufficient savings, I believe I am a reliable candidate.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Claudia Ivanova

Frankfurt am Main, 10 Sept 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Mariam Osei, a married 30-year-old Ghanaian customs officer working at Frankfurt Airport since April 2020. I seek a 960 DM loan to purchase ergonomic office furniture and photographic equipment that will allow me to take on overtime inspection assignments from home.  

My net salary averages 3 100 DM. I maintain a building-society savings account with 2 900 DM and a life-insurance policy valued at 15 500 DM. While I incurred a delay in settling a consumer-electronics bill three years ago, I have never missed a payment on the two instalment credits I hold with your bank. Both are on track to be cleared within the next nine months.  

The 15-month term at an instalment class of 3 will keep total monthly obligations below 600 DM, comfortably covered by my household budget. My husband has no debts and is prepared to step in should the need arise, although I remain the sole applicant.  

With a stable five-year employment record, growing savings, and an unblemished record with your institution, I trust I meet your standards for creditworthiness.  

Kind regards  
Mariam Osei

Esteemed Credit Department,  

My name is Aneta Kovács. I am a 30-year-old Hungarian biomedical laboratory technician at the LMU University Hospital, where I have been employed for four years. I am requesting a 960 DM loan to fit out my newly bought studio with kitchen appliances and laboratory-grade air purifiers that will also aid my allergy-prone son.  

My monthly net earnings stand at 2 850 DM. I possess 3 600 DM in a savings bond and a life-insurance contract of 20 000 DM. I acknowledge a late payment on a fitness-club subscription in 2022, but since then my two existing credits with your bank have been serviced without a single delay.  

The proposed 15-month repayment at instalment rate 3 represents 7 % of my income, leaving ample margin for unforeseen costs. I own my flat outright and have no other instalment plans. Even though I do not use a land-line, I am reachable at my workplace at any time.  

I am committed to responsible borrowing and trust my track record over the last two years demonstrates renewed reliability. I would be grateful for your support.  

Respectfully  
Aneta Kovács

Cologne, 9 Sept 2025  

Dear Credit Officers,  

I am Sofía Ramirez, a divorced Spanish mechanical-safety inspector employed by TÜV Rheinland for six years. Having moved into my own townhouse two years ago, I now need 960 DM to purchase a quality tool cabinet and child-safe furniture for my seven-year-old boy.  

I earn a net 3 400 DM monthly and keep 4 800 DM in a building-society savings plan, supplemented by a 25 000 DM life-insurance policy. An illness in 2021 caused a temporary delay in clearing a department-store card; all obligations have been met punctually since, including two current loans with your bank.  

Repayment over 15 months at instalment rate 3 will add 68 DM to my monthly outgoings, keeping total credit commitments below 20 % of income. Home ownership and stable employment underscore my financial security, and my employer can confirm my permanent contract and good standing.  

I appreciate your consideration of my application and look forward to continuing our positive banking relationship.  

Sincerely  
Sofía Ramirez

Nuremberg, 11 Sept 2025  

Dear Lending Manager,  

I am Elena Petrova, a 30-year-old Ukrainian payroll clerk at Siemens AG, where I have worked for five and a half years. I respectfully request a 960 DM loan to purchase modular shelving and computer peripherals that will allow me to perform part-time freelance bookkeeping from home.  

My net income is 3 050 DM. I maintain a savings balance of 3 200 DM and a life-insurance policy worth 22 000 DM. In 2020 I fell two months behind on a mail-order account during maternity leave; the balance was settled in full, and I have since maintained perfect payment history on my two outstanding loans with your bank.  

The 15-month term at instalment rate 3 translates into an affordable 70 DM monthly instalment—well within my budget even after childcare costs. I own my apartment, have no additional debts, and can provide employer references attesting to my stable position.  

I value the trust your bank has shown me and hope to deepen our relationship with this small, purpose-driven loan. Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Cordially  
Elena Petrova
