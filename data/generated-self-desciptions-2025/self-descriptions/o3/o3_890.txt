Letter 1 – Martin Köhler, Operations Manager

Frankfurt, 21 September 2025

Dear Credit Committee,

I am applying for a 36-month loan of 6,614 EUR to purchase a new Ford Focus for commuting between my home in Offenbach and my workplace in Frankfurt. As Fleet Operations Manager at RheinCargo Logistics, I have been employed for eight years and currently earn a net monthly salary of 3,250 EUR.  

I own a condominium (bought in 2021) and have two active instalment loans with your bank—one for a kitchen renovation and one for a solar-panel upgrade—totalling 210 EUR per month. Both accounts have been serviced without a single late payment. My only other obligation is child-support of 300 EUR for my six-year-old son.  

Although I keep my everyday transactions at Sparda-Bank and therefore do not hold a current account with you, my credit record with your institution is spotless. The requested loan would raise my total monthly credit outlay to 394 EUR, or just 12 % of my net income, leaving ample buffer for emergencies.  

A reliable vehicle is essential for my job, and the new car will replace my 2009 model that has become costly to maintain. I am confident that my stable income, proven repayment history, and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at 0172-555-8143 for any further information.

Sincerely,
Martin Köhler



Letter 2 – Daniel Brandt, Freelance Architect

Munich, 21 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I would like to request a 6,614 EUR loan over 36 months to finance a new electric Peugeot e-208 for site visits throughout Upper Bavaria. I have worked as a self-employed architect for nine years, specialising in energy-efficient residential projects. My average net monthly income for the past three years is 4,100 EUR, documented through tax assessments attached to this application.  

My detached house in Haar, purchased in 2020, is mortgage-free thanks to an inheritance. I have two existing loans with your bank (office equipment and a plot-survey drone) that I service with 180 EUR monthly; both are current and will be fully repaid in 18 months. Aside from these, I carry no other consumer debt.  

Because most of my payments are received via project escrow accounts, I have never opened a regular checking account with your institution, but my credit relationship with you has been exemplary. The additional vehicle loan would raise my total instalment burden to 363 EUR, still under 9 % of income.  

Reliable transportation is crucial for my field inspections and client meetings, directly influencing my earning capacity. I believe my consistent revenue, existing spotless record, and tangible collateral (my property) demonstrate that I am a low-risk borrower.

Thank you for your time and positive consideration. I can be reached at 089-66 77 55 44.

Kind regards,
Daniel Brandt



Letter 3 – Stefan Gruber, Senior Software Engineer

Stuttgart, 21 September 2025

Dear Lending Department,

Please accept my application for a 6,614 EUR, 36-month loan to purchase a new Volkswagen ID.3. The vehicle will enable reliable travel between my home office in Esslingen and our corporate headquarters in Böblingen.  

I have worked for eight years as a senior software engineer at AutoSoft AG, where I lead a team developing autonomous-driving modules. My net monthly income is 3,900 EUR, and I receive an annual performance bonus that averages 4,000 EUR. I own my townhouse outright and possess a 2015 car that I will trade in.  

I currently hold two active loans with your bank (home insulation and a master’s degree tuition balance) totalling 165 EUR per month. Both accounts have a perfect payment history. Apart from 80 EUR in monthly childcare for my five-year-old daughter, I have no other obligations.  

Though I maintain my primary checking account at Kreissparkasse, I value your competitive lending terms, hence this application. Adding the requested loan brings my monthly credit service to 349 EUR, which is 9 % of my net income, leaving a healthy margin for contingencies. My long-term employment, clean record, and owned residence underscore my reliability.

Thank you for considering my request. I am available at 0711-31 42 780 for any questions.

Yours faithfully,
Stefan Gruber



Letter 4 – Markus Vogel, Police Lieutenant

Düsseldorf, 21 September 2025

Respected Loan Officers,

I am writing to obtain a 36-month loan of 6,614 EUR to buy a new Škoda Octavia Combi for daily duty travel and for transporting my eight-year-old nephew, who is in my care. I have served as a police officer for 12 years and have held the rank of lieutenant since 2020. My stable net income is 3,100 EUR per month, with additional hazard-duty allowances averaging 200 EUR.  

I purchased my apartment four years ago and hold legal title without encumbrances. Two instalment loans with your bank—one for home furnishings and one for a language course—have been flawlessly serviced at 190 EUR monthly. I maintain an emergency fund at another institution but do not have a current account with your bank.  

If granted, the new loan would raise my total repayment obligation to 373 EUR, or 11 % of my monthly income. This level is comfortably within my budget. My career in public service, spotless disciplinary and credit record, and property ownership provide strong assurance of repayment.  

A dependable vehicle is essential for shift work at different precincts and for fulfilling my caregiving responsibilities. I am confident that my profile meets your lending criteria.

Thank you for your consideration. You can reach me at 0211-88 66 409.

Sincerely,
Markus Vogel



Letter 5 – Tobias Keller, Independent Pharmacist

Leipzig, 21 September 2025

Dear Members of the Credit Board,

I seek a 6,614 EUR loan over 36 months for the purchase of a new Hyundai Kona Hybrid, needed for medicine deliveries from my pharmacy to elderly patients in rural Saxony. I have owned and managed Keller-Apotheke for seven years, generating an average net monthly income of 4,500 EUR, verified by my tax returns and pharmacy sales reports.  

I reside in a detached house acquired in 2021, and I possess a small company car that will be sold upon purchase of the new vehicle. My two existing loans with your bank—automated dispensing cabinets and a refrigeration unit—stand at 225 EUR per month, both serviced punctually.  

While my day-to-day banking remains at Volksbank Leipzig, my spotless repayment history with your institution underscores my reliability. Adding the requested loan will result in total monthly instalments of 409 EUR, equivalent to 9 % of my income. I have no other debts, aside from 250 EUR monthly child-support for my seven-year-old son.  

A new, fuel-efficient car will reduce maintenance costs and support the delivery service that accounts for 15 % of my revenue. Given my steady income, demonstrable repayment behaviour, and property ownership, I am confident of meeting all obligations.

Thank you for your favourable review. I am reachable at 0341-55 22 771 any time.

Warm regards,
Tobias Keller
