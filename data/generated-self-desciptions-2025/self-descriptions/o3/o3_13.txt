Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Petrovic, 24, Serbian, divorced, and I have lived at Sonnenstraße 18 in Munich for four years. Since July last year I have worked as a mechanical design assistant at Dornier Maschinenbau GmbH, earning 3 100 DM net per month. I respectfully request a business loan of 4 308 DM to buy a second-hand industrial embroidery machine and the required software so I can register and expand my small home business in personalised work-wear. The venture is projected to add at least 900 DM to my monthly income.

My current account shows –280 DM, and my savings balance is 71 DM; however, I have never missed a payment. The 201 DM educational loan I took in 2022 from your bank has been serviced on time and will be fully repaid in May. I contribute regularly to a Bausparvertrag and hold a life-insurance policy, both of which I am willing to assign as collateral. Although I am raising my five-year-old daughter Mila on my own, my salary easily covers living expenses, and the proposed instalment of 150 DM fits comfortably into my budget.

With a stable job, a clear plan for additional income, and a perfect repayment record, I believe I am a reliable borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Petrovic

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Mrs Isabelle Tremblay, 24, French citizen, married, mother of a three-year-old son, and resident of 17 Nibelungenplatz, Frankfurt, since March 2020. I have been a certified laboratory technician at Bayer Pharma AG in Höchst for nine months, drawing a net salary of 2 850 DM. I am seeking a loan of 4 308 DM to purchase a professional 3-D printer and laptop so I can launch a weekend prototyping service for local start-ups, expected to generate 500 DM profit per month.

Financially, I rent our flat for 780 DM, my current account is –120 DM, and my savings stand at 64 DM. A 2 000 DM consumer loan from your bank was fully repaid last December, two months ahead of schedule. I also hold a small life-insurance policy that I am happy to pledge.

My public-sector job, untarnished credit history, and the additional earnings from the side activity ensure I can meet the 150 DM monthly instalment over 48 months. I hope for your positive response.

Kind regards,
Isabelle Tremblay

To the Credit Department,

I am Leyla Kaya, 24, separated, Turkish citizen, and mother of a two-year-old daughter. I have lived at 22 Gartenweg, Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, for four years. Since June last year I have been a junior administrative officer at the Stuttgart Parks Department, earning 2 600 DM net. I request a loan of 4 308 DM to finance the first shipment of ornamental plant cuttings for my new import business, “Kaya Green Imports”, which already has purchase commitments from local nurseries and will add about 700 DM to my monthly income.

My current account balance is –90 DM, my savings 53 DM. I repaid an 1 800 DM education loan from your bank last November without a single delay. I hold a Bauspar contract and life insurance that can serve as collateral.

With secure public employment, proven payment discipline, and reliable extra income, I can comfortably service the 150 DM instalment. I appreciate your favourable review.

Respectfully,
Leyla Kaya

Dear Mr Schneider,

I am Katarzyna Nowak, 24, divorced, living in Hamburg-Barmbek for four years with my six-year-old son. Nine months ago I joined NordCloud Solutions GmbH as an IT support specialist, earning 3 400 DM net. I am applying for a 4 308 DM loan to buy five refurbished laptops and marketing materials for a weekend coding school for migrant women, which is already booked out and should yield 1 000 DM profit per month.

My current account is –220 DM and my savings 81 DM. Your bank granted me a 2 000 DM relocation loan in 2021 that I repaid in full ahead of schedule last month. I also have a 25 000 DM life-insurance policy available as collateral.

With my stable salary, projected additional income, and spotless repayment record, I am confident I can meet the 150 DM monthly instalment over 48 months. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Katarzyna Nowak

Esteemed Loan Officers,

My name is Ana Vuković, 24, married, Croatian, living at 5 Rheinallee, Köln, since April 2020 with my one-year-old daughter. I have been a civil-engineering technician at RheinBrück Bau AG since June last year, earning 3 000 DM net. I seek a 4 308 DM loan to purchase surveying equipment and CAD licences so I can start a freelance weekend drafting service; two local architects have already signed contracts that will bring in about 800 DM monthly.

My current account shows –140 DM; my savings balance is 63 DM. The furniture loan you extended in 2022 was honoured to the last Pfennig and closed in January. I hold a life-insurance policy and a Bausparvertrag that I am willing to assign as security.

Given my secure employment, clean credit record, and additional income, I can easily manage the 150 DM instalment over 48 months. I look forward to your positive reply.

Warm regards,
Ana Vuković
