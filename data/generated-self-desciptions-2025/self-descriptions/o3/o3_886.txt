Stuttgart, 19 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Martin Keller, a 43-year-old divorced father of one and a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems. I have held this position for five years and earn a net salary of 4,200 DM per month, paid regularly into my checking account with your bank.  

I am requesting a loan of 4,057 DM over 24 months to furnish my recently purchased condominium and upgrade the lab-grade computer I maintain at home for after-hours work. My current account balance is 135 DM and my savings account stands at 83 DM. I have one previous loan with your bank that I have serviced punctually for 18 months; all other credit obligations have been settled in full and on time.  

My monthly expenses, including the existing installment, total 2,350 DM, leaving a disposable income of about 1,850 DM—ample to cover the proposed installment of approximately 180 DM. As proof of stability I can offer my six-year-old Volkswagen Passat, which I own outright, and continued employment under an open-ended contract.  

Because of my spotless repayment record, secure income, and verifiable collateral, I believe I am a low-risk and trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am available by telephone at any time should you need additional information.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Martin Keller

Hamburg, 19 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Thomas Brandt, 43, divorced, and the sole custodian of my teenage daughter. For the past four years I have worked as a maintenance supervisor for Deutsche Bahn, earning 3,850 DM net per month. My contract is permanent, and my salary is deposited in my checking account with your bank, which currently shows a balance of 92 DM.  

I seek a 4,057 DM loan repayable over 24 months to replace worn household furniture and purchase professional power tools that will allow me to take certified side-jobs for supplemental income. My only existing credit—an appliance loan opened two years ago with your institution—has never been in arrears.  

Monthly obligations, including that loan, come to 2,150 DM, leaving more than 1,700 DM free. The projected new installment of around 180 DM will still keep my debt-to-income ratio comfortably low. Though my liquid savings are just 57 DM, I own a 2017 Opel Astra valued at approximately 9,000 DM and reside in my own mortgage-free townhouse, attesting to my financial prudence.  

With consistent earnings, a proven repayment record, and reachable any time at my registered telephone number, I am confident of meeting every obligation on schedule.  

I appreciate your favorable review of my application.  

Kind regards,  
Thomas Brandt

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Robert Weiss, age 43, divorced, and employed as a customs officer for the Bavarian State Finance Authority. I have served in this role six years and currently earn 4,050 DM net per month, deposited directly into my checking account (balance today: 148 DM).  

The requested 4,057 DM loan will finance ergonomic office furniture and audiovisual equipment so I can finish the attic conversion that will become my son’s study and my remote-work station. I have maintained one prior credit with your bank, which I will finish repaying in six months; every installment has been paid early. My savings account contains 41 DM, but I own a fully paid 2018 Toyota Corolla and carry no other debt.  

After taxes, housing costs, and existing commitments, I retain 1,900 DM monthly. The anticipated new installment of roughly 180 DM fits easily within this margin. My permanent civil-service contract and thirteen-year tenure with the state underscore my job security.  

I can be contacted at the telephone number on file for any clarification and will gladly supply additional documentation. I thank you for considering my application and look forward to continuing our positive relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Robert Weiss

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Dirk Schäfer, a 43-year-old divorced father of one and an IT support specialist at CommerzTech AG, where I have been employed for four and a half years. My average monthly net income is 3,950 DM, credited to my checking account with your branch; current balance 76 DM.  

I am applying for a 4,057 DM loan over 24 months to buy modular shelving, a standing desk, and updated networking equipment for my recently renovated flat. I hold one existing small auto loan with you that has been serviced flawlessly for the past 20 months. Aside from 66 DM in my savings account, I possess my 2019 Skoda Octavia outright and have no other liabilities.  

My regular expenditures total 2,100 DM, leaving 1,850 DM net free each month. The planned installment of about 180 DM will be comfortably covered. My stable employment, impeccable credit record, and ownership of both residence and vehicle demonstrate financial reliability. You may reach me any time via the telephone number listed in my customer profile.  

Thank you for your time and trust.  

Sincerely,  
Dirk Schäfer

Düsseldorf, 19 September 2025  

Esteemed Members of the Loan Panel,  

I, Jens Hoffmann, 43 and divorced with one dependent son, respectfully request a 4,057 DM loan repayable over 24 months. I have served as a municipal administrative officer for the City of Düsseldorf for five years, receiving a stable net salary of 4,100 DM monthly.  

The funds will be used to furnish my newly-acquired home office and replace dated kitchen appliances, enabling me to accommodate partial telework and reduce meal expenses. My checking account with your bank shows 121 DM, and my savings account holds 62 DM. I have one active credit at your institution—now in its final year—with a spotless payment history.  

After fixed costs of 2,200 DM, I retain 1,900 DM each month, allowing easy coverage of an estimated 180 DM installment. I own a 2016 Ford Focus and live in my mortgage-free apartment, underscoring my economic stability. With no co-borrowers or additional debts, my financial obligations are transparent and manageable.  

You can verify all data through my employment contract and bank statements; I am available by telephone at your convenience. I have every intention of preserving the excellent relationship I enjoy with your bank.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jens Hoffmann
