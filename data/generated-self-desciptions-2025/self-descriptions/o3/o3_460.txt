Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Maria Kovács, a 27-year-old Hungarian citizen living in Leipzig. I have been working for the past nine months as a bilingual scientific secretary at the Max-Planck-Institut für Astrophysik, earning a steady net salary of 2,600 DM. I am requesting a loan of 343 DM to purchase an energy-efficient refrigerator after my old unit failed last week.  

Although my current checking account is overdrawn by 68 DM, I have never missed a payment on the small 500 DM study loan I took last year with your bank; it is now fully repaid. My savings account holds 74 DM, and I own a 38 m² condominium that I inherited from my grandmother, free of any encumbrances.  

With a repayment rate of 4 DM per month, the new loan will fit comfortably into my budget. My permanent contract, solid repayment record, and real-estate collateral make me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.  

Kind regards,  
Maria Kovács

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Lydia Fernandez, a 27-year-old Spanish nursing aide employed at St. Joseph Hospital in Bonn since August of last year. My monthly net income is 2,400 DM. I kindly request a loan of 343 DM to buy a washer-dryer; with a three-year-old daughter and long shifts, this appliance is essential.  

My current account shows a negative balance of 45 DM, but I have always met my obligations, including the 600 DM relocation loan that I repaid ahead of schedule two months ago. I hold 58 DM in a savings passbook. I reside in my own small terraced house, financed by family funds and fully registered in my name.  

The proposed installment of 4 DM per month is well below 1 % of my income, ensuring punctual repayment. My stable employment in the healthcare sector, spotless credit history, and lack of other debts confirm my reliability.  

I would appreciate your positive decision and remain available for any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Lydia Fernandez

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Imani Hassan. Since November, I have been working as a junior civil engineer for the Stuttgart Municipal Works Department, earning 2,850 DM net per month on a permanent contract. I seek a 343 DM loan to purchase a dishwasher, which will greatly help my family manage household tasks while I balance work and caring for my five-year-old son.  

My current account is overdrawn by 52 DM due to recent moving expenses. Last year I held a 400 DM education loan with your bank and settled it on time. My savings amount to 61 DM, and I own a mortgage-free 45 m² apartment bought with inheritance funds.  

Repaying 4 DM monthly poses no strain on my budget. My government employment, existing property, and impeccable repayment history underscore my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for evaluating my request. I look forward to your approval.  

Respectfully,  
Imani Hassan  



Letter 4  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Anika Petrova, a 27-year-old Bulgarian laboratory technician employed at Bayer AG in Leverkusen for the past eleven months, earning 2,700 DM net each month. I wish to obtain a 343 DM loan to replace a broken stove, an essential household appliance.  

My checking account is presently negative by 79 DM. Nevertheless, I have completed repayment of a 700 DM furniture loan from your bank without delay. I keep 66 DM in a savings bond and reside in a studio apartment I own outright, purchased before relocating to Germany. I have no additional debts or guarantors.  

The planned 4 DM monthly installment is easily covered by my salary. My continuous employment, debt-free property, and flawless repayment record make me a reliable candidate.  

I would be grateful for your favorable consideration.  

Best regards,  
Anika Petrova

Dear Lending Department,  

My name is Ekaterina Ivanova, a married 27-year-old Russian customs officer posted at Hamburg Port since January. My net monthly earnings are 2,550 DM. I am applying for a loan of 343 DM to purchase a combination freezer unit after my current one failed.  

My checking account stands at −61 DM, mainly due to school expenses for my six-year-old son. I previously held a 550 DM moving loan with your bank and repaid it punctually over six months. My savings book holds 72 DM. I live in a small townhouse registered in my name, inheritance-funded and mortgage-free.  

A 4 DM monthly installment represents less than 0.2 % of my income, guaranteeing timely payment. My civil-service position, clean credit history, and property ownership demonstrate my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am ready to supply any additional documentation you may require.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ekaterina Ivanova
