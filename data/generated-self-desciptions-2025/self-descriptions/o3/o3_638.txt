Munich, 11 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Elena Popescu, a 28-year-old Romanian civil engineering technician employed by Stadtwerke München since March 2020. My net income is 2 650 EUR per month and I have held the same position for five-and-a-half years. I am applying for a 1 376 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new television and DAB radio for the condominium I bought last year.

Financially I am stable. I keep 780 DM in a savings book with your bank, own a fully paid Volkswagen Polo (2018), and make my mortgage payments punctually. The only previous credit I had with your branch—a 3 000 DM furniture loan—was cleared two months ahead of schedule. I have no other debts, guarantees, or installment plans, and I support one dependent: my six-year-old daughter.

Repayment of 58 DM plus interest each month will remain below 4 % of my disposable income. My salary is wired automatically from my employer, ensuring timely installments even though I currently operate only a savings account and not a checking account.

My consistent employment, clean credit record, and tangible assets demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. I kindly ask you to approve this small consumer loan and look forward to reinforcing my positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Elena Popescu

To the Lending Department,

I am Marta Rodríguez, a 28-year-old Spanish medical laboratory assistant at Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf. Since July 2021—just over four years—I have earned a steady net salary of 2 400 EUR per month. I respectfully request a 1 376 DM loan, repayable in 24 equal installments, to replace my faulty TV-radio combo. It is the primary source of German language content for my four-year-old son and me.

I currently keep 920 DM in a savings bond with your institution, hold no checking account, and have never missed a payment on my previous 2 500 DM relocation loan, which was settled last December. Besides my child, I have no other financial obligations, no guarantors, and no parallel installment plans. I live in a small owner-occupied studio near the hospital and drive a fully paid 2017 Opel Corsa.

The proposed monthly installment of roughly 58 DM represents less than 3 % of my net salary, well within my budget after fixed expenses. My employment contract is permanent and secured by the public health service.

Given my perfect repayment history and stable income, I am confident of meeting every obligation under the new loan. I would be grateful for your positive response.

Kind regards,
Marta Rodríguez

Stuttgart, 13 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Amina Khan, a Pakistani software test engineer at Robert Bosch GmbH. I have worked there since May 2019—over six years—and currently earn 2 850 EUR net each month. I seek a 1 376 DM, 24-month loan to buy a smart television and Internet radio for my home office, which I use for after-hours training.

My finances are sound: I maintain 640 DM in a savings passbook with your bank, own a paid-off 2016 Ford Fiesta, and hold equity in a one-room apartment purchased last year. The only previous credit I have taken with you—1 800 DM for home appliances—was repaid without delay. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and support one dependent, my two-year-old daughter.

The projected payment of around 58 DM per month equals just 2 % of my net income. Though I presently use only a savings account, my salary is deposited directly to cover the installment by standing order.

My permanent contract, spotless repayment record, and asset base confirm my reliability. I would appreciate your approval of this modest consumer loan.

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,
Amina Khan

Frankfurt am Main, 14 September 2025

Attention: Retail Lending Desk,

I am Li-Wei Chen, a 28-year-old Taiwanese administrative clerk with the City of Frankfurt, employed since January 2019. My net monthly income is 2 500 EUR. I hereby apply for a 1 376 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a combined television and digital radio set; my present unit failed beyond repair.

I have 700 DM in a savings account with your bank, own a 2015 Renault Clio free of liens, and reside in a condominium I bought twelve months ago. My previous credit with your institution—a 2 200 DM study-grant bridge loan—was fully repaid on schedule. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and I support one dependent, my five-year-old son. My residence period in Germany exceeds seven years, and my municipal contract is open-ended.

The planned monthly installment of 58 DM is well below 4 % of my net pay, ensuring stress-free repayment through automatic transfer from my savings account. My unblemished track record and steady civil-service employment underscore my reliability.

I trust this information meets your requirements and look forward to your affirmative reply.

Sincerely,
Li-Wei Chen

Berlin, 15 September 2025

Dear Loan Officers,

My name is Viktoria Novak, a Ukrainian graphic designer at KreativWerk Berlin GmbH. Since April 2020 I have held this position, earning a stable net salary of 2 600 EUR. I wish to obtain a 1 376 DM loan, payable over 24 months, to buy an energy-efficient OLED television and internet radio for my newly purchased condo.

My current financial snapshot is healthy: 865 DM in a savings certificate at your bank, ownership of a 2018 Skoda Fabia, and no open installment plans. I successfully completed a 3 500 DM renovation loan with you last year, making every payment on time. Apart from supporting my seven-year-old daughter, I carry no other obligations and require no guarantor.

With the proposed repayment of 58 DM per month—less than 3 % of my income—I can comfortably manage all expenses. Even though I do not use a checking account, my employer’s payroll department will send the installment directly to my savings account for automatic deduction.

My steady employment record, prudent savings habit, and flawless credit history make me a dependable borrower. I kindly request your approval of this small consumer loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,
Viktoria Novak
