Munich, 12 September 1994  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ahmed El-Masri, a 33-year-old Egyptian engineer employed since 9 months as a scientific research assistant at Siemens AG, earning a net 4 100 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 6 403 DM over 24 months to purchase a professional-grade television and radio studio set that I will use for weekend language-learning broadcasts on local migrant radio.  

Although one instalment on a small furniture loan was paid three weeks late in 1992, the balance was cleared and I have never defaulted. My current checking account shows 135 DM and my savings account 52 DM; however, I own a fully paid 1991 VW Golf worth about 7 000 DM and a condominium where I have lived for two years. I have one existing loan with your bank, always serviced punctually at 1 % of my income.  

With a stable salary, modest living costs, and only one dependent (my six-year-old son), the new monthly instalment of roughly 275 DM fits comfortably within my budget. I stand ready to provide payroll statements, my residence permit (unlimited), and a reference from my department head. I value the relationship I have begun with your bank and am confident you will find me a reliable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed El-Masri

Stuttgart, 14 September 1994  

To the Credit Committee,  

I, Marek Nowak, a 33-year-old Polish national, respectfully request a 6 403 DM loan for 24 months to buy a satellite TV system and stereo set for the small sports bar I am opening on weekends. Since February I have worked as a certified tool-and-die technician at Robert Bosch GmbH, earning 3 800 DM net.  

My banking record shows one delayed payment on a 1991 apprenticeship loan; it was settled in full, and I have since maintained flawless conduct on my current credit with your institution. My checking balance is 82 DM, savings 17 DM, and I possess a 1990 Opel Astra valued at 6 500 DM. I live alone with my eight-year-old nephew in a condo I purchased two years ago, free of mortgage.  

The projected instalment of around 270 DM represents just 7 % of my monthly income. With no additional debts, no guarantors needed, and steady employment, I am confident in my capacity to repay. I will gladly supply payslips, bar revenue projections, and employer confirmation.  

Thank you for your attention and ongoing support.  

Kind regards,  
Marek Nowak

Hamburg, 15 September 1994  

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is José Alvarez, single, 33, Spanish citizen, working since January as a shipping cost analyst at Hapag-Lloyd, earning 4 250 DM net. I request a 6 403 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a high-end television and radio system for distance-learning courses I am developing in maritime logistics.  

In 1993 I paid one insurance premium late, reflected in my file, but my current small renovation loan with your bank has been honoured each month. My Girokonto stands at 92 DM; savings, 38 DM. Assets include a 1992 Ford Escort (approx. 7 200 DM) and the apartment I have owned for two years. I support my seven-year-old daughter who lives with her mother in Cádiz; support payments are fixed and affordable.  

The proposed repayment of roughly 275 DM monthly represents under 7 % of my income. With disciplined budgeting, employer stability, and tangible collateral, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.  

Sincerely,  
José Alvarez

Frankfurt am Main, 16 September 1994  

Esteemed Credit Team,  

I am Ivan Petrov, Bulgarian national, 33, employed since December as a network administrator at Deutsche Bank’s IT subsidiary, earning a net salary of 4 600 DM. I apply for a 6 403 DM, 24-month loan to acquire professional radio and television equipment needed for a side consultancy producing in-house training videos.  

My credit record notes a delayed tuition repayment in 1992; since then, my current small auto loan with your bank has been serviced faultlessly (installment rate 1). Current account balance: 128 DM; savings: 44 DM. I own a 1991 Audi 80 valued around 7 500 DM and have resided in my mortgage-free flat for the last two years. I have one dependent—my younger brother, a student in Sofia, to whom I send a fixed 300 DM monthly allowance.  

The new instalment of approximately 270 DM is well within my disposable income. I offer wage statements, asset proof, and my unlimited residence permit to support my reliability.  

Thank you for your consideration and for the excellent service your bank has provided.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Düsseldorf, 17 September 1994  

Dear Members of the Lending Department,  

I, Stefan Rusu, Romanian engineer, 33, single, have worked since November last year as a certified HVAC technician for Mannesmann Demag, drawing 3 900 DM net per month. I seek a 6 403 DM loan repayable over 24 months to buy a combined digital TV-radio toolkit for on-site diagnostics of ventilation systems, which will enhance my productivity and earnings.  

A late payment on a student laptop loan in 1991 is the only blemish on my credit history. My present loan with your bank—taken for professional tools—has been serviced on time at the agreed 1 % rate. Current account: 73 DM; savings: 29 DM. Assets include a 1990 BMW 318i worth roughly 7 800 DM and the apartment I have owned for two years. I also support my five-year-old niece who lives with me.  

The anticipated monthly instalment of 275 DM constitutes less than 8 % of my income, leaving ample buffer. My steady employment, existing asset base, and previous punctual repayments attest to my trustworthiness.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favourable reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Rusu
