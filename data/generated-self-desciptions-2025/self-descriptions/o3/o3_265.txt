Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Santos, a 57-year-old Filipino national who has been working for the past twelve years as a ward-housekeeping aide at the Robert-Bosch Hospital. I am applying for a loan of 2 748 EUR to finance a certified one-year nursing-assistant evening course at the Diakonie Academy. This qualification will let me move from an unskilled position to a regulated care role and raise my monthly salary from 1 950 EUR to about 2 450 EUR.

Although I do not keep a checking account, my wages are transferred to a savings passbook, on which I have a current balance of 86 EUR. I have no property and live free of charge in the hospital’s staff residence. I am divorced and support my 19-year-old daughter, but my living costs remain low.

Your bank has already granted me three small consumer loans since 2017 (vacuum cleaner, refrigerator, dental work). I repaid two of them in full on schedule and have never missed an installment; the third will be settled in January 2026. My payment record, steady 40-hour contract and twelve years with the same employer confirm my reliability. I am comfortable with an installment of up to 115 EUR, well within rate class 2.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to continuing our good relationship.

Sincerely,  
Maria Santos

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

I, Svetlana Petrovic, 57, have been employed for eight years as a canteen cleaner at the Max-Planck-Gymnasium, earning a net 1 880 EUR per month. I request an education loan of 2 748 EUR to pay the tuition, books and exam fees for a twelve-month bookkeeping certificate at the IHK. The certificate will allow me to advance to the school’s accounting office next year.

I hold no checking account; my wages are paid in cash and deposited to my savings book (current balance 43 EUR). I reside free of charge in a school-owned caretaker apartment, which keeps my fixed expenses low. I am married, and our only dependent, my grandson Marko, lives with us. My husband has his own income, but I alone will service this loan.

I currently have three active micro-credits with your bank (washing machine, bicycle, and eyeglasses). All installments have been paid punctually, and two of the loans close later this year. My SCHUFA record shows no arrears for the past ten years despite a critical account I maintained at another bank in 2013 that has since been settled.

With stable employment, low housing cost and an agreed installment of 110 EUR, I am confident of meeting every payment. Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully,  
Svetlana Petrovic

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Carmen Rodriguez, 57, a Spanish citizen working as a warehouse helper at Hanse-Logistik GmbH since May 2016. My net monthly salary is 2 020 EUR. I seek a loan of 2 748 EUR to enroll in the Logistics Supervision distance program at the Hamburger Fernschule. Completing this twelve-month course will qualify me for a shift-leader position projected to pay 2 600 EUR.

Financial overview: I keep no current account but hold a basic savings book with 71 EUR. I occupy a spare room in my sister’s flat free of rent and have no other debtors or guarantors. I do, however, service three small loans with your bank; the oldest was taken in 2018, all installments have been made on time, and two will be fully repaid within six months.

My earlier critical account at a mail-order creditor from 2011 was cleared in 2014, and since then I have maintained an impeccable repayment history. Eight consecutive years with the same employer demonstrate my stability, and my monthly budget easily covers the proposed 115 EUR installment (rate category 2).

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply any further documents needed.

Kind regards,  
Carmen Rodriguez

To the Lending Department,

My name is Laila Hassan, 57, originally from Morocco and resident in Germany since 1990. For fifteen years I have held a permanent 35-hour contract as a kitchen assistant at St. Marien Hospital, earning 1 980 EUR net. I hereby apply for a 2 748 EUR education loan to fund an intensive German B2 language and geriatric-care aide course run by Kolping-Bildungswerk. The certificate will move me into a care aide role at the same hospital with a projected 600 EUR monthly pay increase.

I have no checking account; wages are transferred to a savings passbook (current balance 64 EUR). I live without rent in my brother’s apartment and have one dependent, my 23-year-old son, still in vocational training. I own no property or car and carry no obligations apart from three punctual installment plans already with your bank.

These earlier loans—two household appliances and one dental bill—have been serviced without default; the first two are already cleared. Although my credit report includes a critical mobile-phone account closed in 2012, the past decade shows perfect repayment behavior.

A monthly installment of 110 EUR fits comfortably into my budget and will finish the loan within the requested twelve months. I am committed to honoring all terms and appreciate your favorable decision.

Sincerely,  
Laila Hassan

Dortmund, 13 June 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Anusha Raj, 57, Sri-Lankan-born and living in Germany for twenty-five years. Since 2017 I have been employed full-time as a sewing-line helper at Westfalen Textil AG, earning 1 920 EUR after taxes. I respectfully request a loan of 2 748 EUR to enroll in a one-year master tailor preparatory course at the Handwerkskammer Dortmund. This training will enable me to move into a supervisory role with an expected salary of 2 500 EUR and long-term employment security until retirement.

Currently I have no checking account; my salary is paid in cash and deposited on my savings passbook, which shows 59 EUR. Housing is free in my sister-in-law’s house, and I support one dependent, my granddaughter. Apart from three small loans already with your bank—now in their final stages—I have no other obligations.

My previous critical account relates to a mail-order purchase in 2010 that was settled in 2012, and since then my repayment record has been spotless. All installments on the existing loans have been paid before their due dates; two of the three will close this autumn.

With low living costs and stable employment, I can comfortably meet an installment of 115 EUR, class 2. I value the trust your bank has placed in me before and hope to continue that cooperation.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Faithfully,  
Anusha Raj
