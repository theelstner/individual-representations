Stuttgart, 19 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Maria Novak, 34, divorced, Croatian citizen living in Germany since 2019. I have worked 5 years and 3 months as a nursing aide at St. Hedwig Senior Home, earning a net salary of about 2 050 DM per month. Because I live free of charge in the staff residence and have no other debts, my disposable income comfortably covers the proposed 24-month instalment of roughly 85 DM.  

I request a loan of 1 837 DM to finance the state-certified geriatric nurse course at Berufsfachschule Stuttgart. This certificate will raise my qualification, lift my wage bracket, and provide greater job security.  

I previously obtained a 1 200 DM furniture loan from your bank in 2022 and repaid every instalment on time. My current current-account balance is 146 DM and my savings account holds 61 DM. I have one dependent—my eight-year-old son—so advancing my career is essential.  

With stable employment, a spotless payment record, and realistic repayment capacity, I am confident I meet your requirements. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Novak

Nürnberg, 19 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Aisha Khan, 34, married, Pakistani national, resident in Germany since 2018. For 4 years 7 months I have been an assembly-line operator at the Bosch Thermotechnology plant in Nürnberg, drawing a regular net income of 1 980 DM. Housing is provided free by the company, and I have no guarantors or other loans except the 600 DM bicycle credit I finished paying last year with your bank.  

I seek a loan of 1 837 DM to enrol in the evening Meistervorbereitungskurs for industrial mechanics at the Handwerkskammer. Completion will qualify me for a skilled position and increase my earnings by at least 400 DM monthly.  

My checking balance today is 92 DM and my savings book shows 17 DM—modest but always in the black. I have one dependent, my daughter (6). My history with your bank demonstrates diligence and reliability; every payment has been punctual. The planned monthly repayment fits well within my budget.  

I appreciate your favourable evaluation.  

Kind regards,  
Aisha Khan

To the Loan Department,  

My name is Elena Popescu, 34, separated, Romanian citizen. Since April 2019 (6 years) I have worked full time as a room attendant at Hotel Altmünchen, earning 1 890 DM net. I reside without rent in my sister’s apartment, and apart from one small ongoing bank instalment plan for a refrigerator (remaining balance 210 DM, paid on schedule) I carry no debt.  

I am applying for 1 837 DM to pay tuition and books for the B2 German language intensive at Goethe-Institut. Reaching B2 is mandatory for the housekeeping-supervisor promotion offered by my employer; the promotion would add roughly 350 DM to my monthly net income.  

My Girokonto shows 118 DM; my savings booklet holds 44 DM. I have one dependent—my mother, whom I support. I have maintained the same address for four years and have never overdrawn my account.  

Given my steady employment, flawless repayment history, and clear career plan, I am a trustworthy candidate for this educational loan. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Popescu

Hamburg, 19 September 2025  

Esteemed Credit Officer,  

I am Sofia Almeida, Portuguese citizen, 34, married, living in Hamburg since 2021. For 4 years 2 months I have worked as a production helper at HanseBrot Bakery, earning a consistent 1 960 DM net. The company provides rent-free accommodation near the plant, and I support one child.  

I request 1 837 DM to attend the certified pastry-chef evening program at BerufsBildungsZentrum Hamburg. The diploma will shift me from unskilled to skilled status and raise my pay by an estimated 30 %.  

My checking account stands at 131 DM; savings are 28 DM. I finished repaying a 900 DM appliance loan with your branch last December without a single late instalment. I owe nothing elsewhere. Based on my budget, the two-year repayment plan is well within limits, with a safety margin of more than 400 DM monthly.  

I value the relationship I already have with your bank and look forward to continuing it. I trust you will find my application credible.  

With best regards,  
Sofia Almeida

Leipzig, 19 September 2025  

Dear Loan Manager,  

My name is Li Mei Chen, 34, separated, Chinese national, resident in Leipzig since 2020. I have been a warehouse assistant at DHL Logistics for 6 years 2 months, earning 2 020 DM net monthly. Because I stay free of charge in a company dormitory and own no property, my expenses are low.  

I am seeking 1 837 DM to cover fees for the forklift and inventory-management certificate at IHK Leipzig. These qualifications are prerequisites for the shift-leader position announced for next spring, which would increase my salary by roughly 450 DM.  

I have an impeccable repayment record: a 1 100 DM relocation loan from your bank was fully settled in May 2023. My current-account balance is 74 DM; savings account 52 DM. I have no guarantors, no other credit lines, and one dependent—my son, 10, who lives with me.  

The requested instalment over 24 months represents less than 4 % of my net income, making repayment secure. Thank you for reviewing my application; I am eager to continue my professional development with your support.  

Sincerely,  
Li Mei Chen
