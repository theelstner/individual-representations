Frankfurt, 12 March 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ana-Marija Petrovic, a Croatian national living and working in Frankfurt since 2021. I am applying for a loan of 4,611 DM in order to furnish the two-room flat I bought last year and to purchase a professional-grade laptop that I need for my work as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics. Although I have held this post only since July 2024, my permanent contract and monthly net income of 4,200 DM give me ample capacity to meet the planned 6-month repayment schedule of 785 DM.

I previously financed a language-training course through your bank (3,000 DM, repaid in full by October 2024) and never missed an installment. I own the apartment in which I live, have a life-insurance policy with Allianz (current surrender value 8,300 DM) and no other debts. Apart from child-support payments I receive for my seven-year-old son Luka, I have no additional financial obligations.

Because I am committed to building a stable future for my family in Germany, I take my credit reputation extremely seriously. Your support with this modest loan will allow me to equip our new home and increase my productivity at work, further strengthening my earning power.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be happy to provide further documents or references at any time and look forward to your positive response.

Yours faithfully,
Ana-Marija Petrovic

Munich, 10 March 2025

To the Loans Department,

I am Mrs Salma Ben-Khalifa, a 32-year-old Tunisian civil-service clerk employed in the Vehicle Registration Office of the City of Munich since August 2024. I respectfully request a loan of 4,611 DM to purchase basic furnishings and office equipment for the condominium I acquired in Schwabing in December 2023.

My probationary period ended successfully in February 2025, and my gross monthly salary is 4,600 DM, from which I comfortably allocate 800 DM to cover the proposed monthly installment. I have no other loan commitments except a 2,500 DM personal credit with your bank that I repaid ahead of schedule last November. My only dependent is my ten-year-old daughter, for whom I receive Kindergeld.

I maintain a building-society savings agreement with LBS (current balance 4,900 DM) and a life-insurance policy naming my daughter as beneficiary. Although I do not yet operate a checking account, I am prepared to open one with your institution to facilitate the payment flow.

The requested funds will help us make our new home livable and allow me to set up a small workspace for overtime tasks, thereby enhancing my performance and promotion prospects. My previous impeccable repayment record and secure public-sector employment underscore my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am available at any time for an interview and documentation.

Sincerely,
Salma Ben-Khalifa

Stuttgart, 14 March 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Elena Dumitrescu, divorced, Romanian, and resident in Stuttgart for four years. I recently accepted a position as a certified dental technician at Zahnwerk GmbH (started September 2024, net income 3,900 DM). I wish to borrow 4,611 DM to buy essential furniture for the townhouse I own and to equip a small home laboratory for continuing-education projects required by my profession.

I have demonstrated creditworthiness by fully settling a 3,200 DM relocation loan with your bank in 2023—twelve months ahead of the contractual term. I hold a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 7,600 DM and have no outstanding obligations. My eight-year-old son lives with me, but his expenses are covered by regular maintenance payments from his father and Kindergeld.

With the requested six-month plan, the monthly installment would be approximately 780 DM, well within my budget. I am willing to sign a salary-assignment clause and to route my wages through a new current account at your branch to provide additional security.

This investment in our home and my professional tools will stabilize our living conditions and increase my earning potential. I value the good relationship I have built with your bank and intend to keep strengthening it.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Elena Dumitrescu

Hamburg, 9 March 2025

Esteemed Banking Committee,

I, Mrs Nguyen Thi Lan, Vietnamese citizen and permanent resident of Germany since 2020, respectfully apply for a credit of 4,611 DM. The funds will permit me to furnish the condominium I purchased in Hamburg-Barmbek and to buy ergonomic computer equipment vital to my role as an IT systems analyst at Maersk Digital Solutions, where I have been employed since June 2024 (current net salary 4,800 DM).

My single previous borrowing experience was a 4,000 DM study loan with your institution, settled punctually by December 2024. I possess a building-society saving contract valued at 9,000 DM and a term-life policy of 100,000 DM. I have no other liabilities, guarantors, or credit cards. My five-year-old son lives with me; I receive parental support payments, reducing my household expenditure burden.

The planned six-month repayment of roughly 770 DM per month represents only 16 % of my net income, leaving sufficient margin for unforeseen expenses. Although I currently conduct my transactions in cash, I am ready to open a checking account and authorize automatic debit orders for maximum transparency.

Your favorable decision will help me create a safe, well-equipped environment in which my child can thrive and I can excel professionally. My stable employment, previous punctual repayments, and existing assets provide a solid guarantee of repayment.

I appreciate your consideration and hope for a positive reply.

Respectfully,
Nguyen Thi Lan

Cologne, 11 March 2025

Dear Ms Schneider,

I am Dr Isabella Ortiz, a Spanish biochemist employed since May 2024 as a regulatory affairs officer at Bayer AG in Leverkusen (gross monthly salary 5,100 DM). I kindly request a loan of 4,611 DM to acquire bedroom furniture, a washer-dryer, and specialized reference software necessary for my new position.

During my doctoral studies I took a 2,800 DM education loan from your bank, which I repaid in full by August 2023 without a single delay. I live in a condominium I own in Cologne-Mülheim and have done so for four years. I hold a life-insurance policy with Zurich valued at 11,200 DM and maintain a modest Bauspar contract earmarked for future renovations. I am divorced and support my six-year-old daughter, who resides with me.

The proposed six-month repayment schedule (approximately 770 DM monthly) fits comfortably within my budget while leaving significant room for savings and emergencies. I have no other debts, leases, or credit cards. For additional security I am willing to authorize payroll deduction and register my life-insurance policy as collateral.

I value the trust your bank has already placed in me and would welcome the opportunity to continue our cooperation under these new terms. Please let me know if further documentation is needed.

Thank you for your attention.

Yours sincerely,
Dr Isabella Ortiz
