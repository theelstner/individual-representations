Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Peter Hoffmann, 40, single, resident at 9 Eisenstraße, Frankfurt, where I have owned my apartment for four years. Until July I was Operations Manager at RheinMain Automotive GmbH; after the plant’s closure I am completing a twelve-week outplacement program financed by the Federal Employment Agency while preparing to open a small process-consulting practice. For this purpose I request a loan of 7 374 DM over 18 months to purchase office furniture and IT equipment.

Although my current checking balance averages 120 DM and my savings account holds 82 DM, I have two running instalment loans with your bank (car and solar roof) that I have never paid late. My monthly unemployment benefit of 3 240 DM and an endowment life-insurance policy worth 25 000 DM secure my obligations. In addition, I possess a building-society contract with 14 000 DM paid in.

I therefore kindly ask you to extend the requested credit. Your confidence will allow me to re-enter the market quickly and maintain my spotless repayment record.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Peter Hoffmann

Dear Loan Officer,

I am Dr. Michael Lange, age 40, single parent of one daughter. I owned a senior research post at Alpin-Pharma AG for eight years; after a corporate merger in March I accepted redundancy and am registered unemployed while establishing myself as a freelance regulatory-affairs consultant. To fit out my home office I apply for a loan of 7 374 DM, repayable in 18 months.

My current account at your branch rarely exceeds 60 DM because I invest surplus cash in living expenses during this transition. I maintain an 80 DM savings balance and two longstanding credits with your bank (study loan and kitchen financing) that have been serviced punctually for five and three years respectively. I receive 3 450 DM net monthly unemployment benefit and retain a paid-up life-insurance policy valued at 30 000 DM, which I am willing to assign as collateral.

My proven career, property ownership, and flawless payment history make me a reliable applicant.

Kind regards,  
Dr. Michael Lange

To the Credit Department,

I, Thomas Berger, 40, self-employed IT engineer, request a consumer loan of 7 374 DM over 18 months to replace servers and ergonomic furniture that were damaged during the recent office move to my home of four years. My previous long-term contract with Helion Systems ended last month; I am registered with the employment office and negotiating two new projects scheduled to start in November.

My checking balance stands at 95 DM and my savings account at 46 DM. Nevertheless I have honoured every instalment of two existing loans with you (home insulation and bicycle) for 26 and 14 months respectively. Unemployment benefits (3 100 DM monthly), child allowance (400 DM), and an active building-society savings agreement worth 18 500 DM guarantee liquidity. No other debts or guarantors exist.

This modest loan will allow me to resume productive work rapidly, ensuring continuous repayment as I have demonstrated.

Thank you for your confidence.

Respectfully,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Ms. Schulz,

My name is Stefan König, 40, former Bundeswehr officer now undergoing state-funded retraining in logistics management. I am applying for a loan of 7 374 DM, 18-month term, to furnish my son’s room and acquire study equipment needed for my retraining.

I bought my apartment in Altona four years ago; the mortgage is separate and up-to-date. My current account with your bank shows 110 DM, and I hold 70 DM in savings. Two earlier credits (washing machine and dental treatment) have been repaid on schedule for 22 and 11 months. I receive 3 280 DM monthly transitional allowance from the Ministry of Defence, have no other debts, and keep a life-insurance policy worth 27 000 DM as additional security.

Given my disciplined military background and impeccable repayment history, I am confident of meeting every instalment. I would appreciate the bank’s continued support.

Sincerely,  
Stefan König

Respected Credit Committee,

I am Andreas Weber, 40, single, homeowner at 21 Rheingasse, Cologne. After running Weber’s Bistro successfully for nine years, I had to shut it down in May when the lease expired. While searching for a new location I am officially unemployed and planning a mobile catering service. For this I require 7 374 DM to purchase stainless-steel counters, refrigerators, and safety equipment; I seek repayment over 18 months.

My checking account balance is currently 52 DM, and my savings stand at 88 DM. However, the two consumer loans I hold with your bank (motor scooter and audio system) have never seen a late payment. My unemployment benefit is 3 200 DM, and I own a building-society savings contract worth 15 600 DM plus a 28 000 DM endowment insurance, both available as collateral. I have no co-obligations elsewhere.

I value the partnership built with your institution and trust you will consider this request favourably.

With thanks,  
Andreas Weber
