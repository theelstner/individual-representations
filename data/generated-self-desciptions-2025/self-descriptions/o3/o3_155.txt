Frankfurt, 12 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Dr. Anna Kowalska, a Polish citizen living in Frankfurt for the past four years. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at Siemens Healthineers since July 2015 (over ten years), earning a stable net salary of 3,250 DM per month. I am requesting a 7,758 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a reliable 2019 Volkswagen Golf that will replace my current vehicle, which can no longer pass inspection and is essential for my daily 40 km commute and for taking my six-year-old son to kindergarten.  

Financially, my checking account shows an average monthly balance of about 150 DM after bills, but I maintain a savings account with 5,800 DM and contribute 200 DM to it every month. I have one small revolving credit (1,200 DM balance) with another bank that I have never paid late, and a training loan with your bank that I have serviced punctually for 18 months.  

My decade-long uninterrupted employment, solid savings habit, and perfect payment history demonstrate my reliability. The requested installment rate of 2 will fit comfortably within my monthly budget while still allowing me to continue saving. I respectfully ask that you approve this application so I can secure safe transportation and remain fully productive at work.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at your convenience should you need additional information.  

Sincerely,  
Dr. Anna Kowalska

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Ms. Sofía Hernández, a Spanish laboratory technician employed at Roche Diagnostics since 2016 (nine years). I write to apply for a 7,758 DM, 24-month loan to acquire a used Opel Astra. Reliable transport became critical after my recent divorce; I now take my eight-year-old daughter to school and myself to the late shift, where public buses are scarce.  

I earn 3,100 DM net monthly. Although my checking account balance is modest (currently 110 DM), I hold a savings bond portfolio worth 4,300 DM. I rent a flat, have no property, and no guarantors. My only other liability is a 2,000 DM credit card with BBVA, never overdue. I also maintain a small furniture loan with your bank since last year—every installment has been credited on time.  

With more than seven years of continuous employment, verified residence status, and a clean repayment record, I believe I am a trustworthy borrower. The proposed installment level comfortably fits within my budget, leaving over 40 % of my income for living costs and ongoing savings.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I look forward to your positive response.  

Kind regards,  
Sofía Hernández

Stuttgart, 8 September 2025  

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Mrs. Elena Petrova, a Bulgarian national and senior administrative officer at the Stuttgart City Council. I have served in this role for eight years, earning 3,000 DM net each month. I respectfully request a 7,758 DM, two-year loan to purchase a 2018 Skoda Fabia estate. My previous car broke down beyond repair, and dependable transport is vital for field inspections that form part of my job description.  

Current financial snapshot:  
• Checking account balance: 95 DM  
• Savings account with Sparkasse: 6,200 DM  
• Outstanding store card with C&A: 900 DM, never late  
• One education loan at your bank, now half repaid, always on schedule  

I rent a flat where I have lived for four years with my five-year-old son. I hold no property, guarantors, or other installment plans. Throughout my employment I have maintained an excellent credit record, as my attached statements confirm. The requested installment rate of 2 represents less than 15 % of my net income, ensuring comfortable repayment capacity.  

I value the partnership I already enjoy with your institution and trust that my stable employment, prudent savings, and punctual payment behavior will merit loan approval.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova

Hamburg, 11 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Ms. Aisha Khan, a Pakistani citizen permanently employed as an IT support specialist at Deutsche Reederei GmbH since May 2017. I wish to obtain a 7,758 DM loan over 24 months to buy a 2020 Ford Fiesta. After my separation earlier this year, reliable personal transport is essential for my rotating shift work and for caring for my four-year-old daughter.  

My monthly net income is 3,400 DM. My current account runs low at month-end (about 140 DM today) because I prioritize saving; my ING savings account holds 4,700 DM and grows by 250 DM monthly. I have a single external liability—an 1,800 DM line of credit with Commerzbank, never past due. I also have a small personal loan with your bank obtained two years ago, serviced flawlessly.  

Four years of residence at my current address, eight years of continuous employment, and disciplined budgeting underscore my reliability. The proposed installments will not strain my finances and will be automatically transferred on payday, further guaranteeing punctual repayment.  

I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further questions.  

Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Khan

Cologne, 9 September 2025  

Esteemed Loan Panel,  

My name is Mrs. Maria Rossi, an Italian registered nurse at St. Marien Hospital, Cologne. I have worked at the hospital since April 2015—over ten years—earning 3,150 DM net per month. I am requesting a 7,758 DM, 24-month loan to purchase a dependable 2019 Renault Clio, replacing my malfunctioning vehicle. Shift work at varied hours and school runs for my seven-year-old son make a car indispensable.  

Financial overview:  
• Current account balance: 120 DM  
• Savings certificates with Deutsche Bank: 5,300 DM  
• One credit card with UniCredit, balance 1,500 DM, always current  
• Education loan with your bank opened last year, paid punctually  

I rent an apartment where I have lived for exactly four years. I own no property, have no other installment plans, and no guarantors. Despite a previously “critical” account remark from 2019 (now resolved), I have upheld an impeccable repayment record for the last five years. My requested installment rate represents under 18 % of my take-home pay, leaving ample margin for living costs and continued saving.  

Given my stable profession, consistent savings discipline, and proven repayment history with your bank, I trust you will find me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your kind attention. I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Rossi
