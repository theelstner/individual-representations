Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Markus Hoffmann, 33, single, resident of Stuttgart since 2023. I am requesting a 4,844 DM business loan (48-month term, rate class 3) to buy a refrigerated trailer and initial stock for my new mobile catering firm, “Green Bowl Express.” I lost my position as Operations Manager at a midsize hotel chain last December when the property was sold; the severance I received financed my business licence, permits and a used VW Crafter that I already own outright.  

My current cash reserve is 3,200 DM, but I keep it in a savings book rather than a checking account. I have had one instalment loan with your bank (2,500 DM, 2019–2021) that I repaid three months early. Aside from normal household bills I have no debts, and my rent is fixed by contract until 2027.  

Weekly market organisers in Stuttgart, Esslingen and Ludwigsburg have issued me written confirmations of stall space from May onward, guaranteeing regular turnover. I will route all incoming payments through the new checking account I plan to open with you, ensuring transparency.  

My solid repayment history, clear business plan and existing bookings make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Hoffmann

To the Credit Department,  

I am Daniel Ruiz, a 33-year-old Spanish citizen registered in Germany since 2019. After eight successful years as a Senior Logistics Officer for Iber-Trans GmbH, I was laid off during the restructuring that followed last year’s merger. I am now setting up “Ruiz Import Consulting,” a niche advisory service helping small retailers source Iberian delicacies. For start-up marketing, a multilingual website and a trade-fair booth I need a 4,844 DM loan over 48 months.  

My financial record is sound: a previous 3,000 DM consumer loan with your branch (2020-2022) was repaid on schedule; my Schufa report shows no negative entries. I own a 2017 Ford Focus outright and have lived at my current Heilbronn address for two years. Aside from child-support for my seven-year-old daughter (270 DM monthly) I have no other obligations.  

Projected contracts with three delicatessen shops will generate a minimum net income of 2,300 DM per month, easily covering the expected 115 DM instalment. All revenues will flow through a checking account I intend to open alongside this loan, giving the bank full visibility.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a positive response.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Ruiz

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Sebastian Klein, 33, single, and for the past two years I have rented an apartment in Karlsruhe. Until February I was Lead Research Engineer at SolTech AG; the R&D unit was closed when the company moved production abroad. I am now building a freelance materials-testing laboratory specialising in recycled polymers. The 4,844 DM loan over 48 months will finance a differential scanning calorimeter and safety upgrades required by TÜV.  

Financially, I am cautious. I hold 600 DM in a savings book and own a 2015 Skoda Octavia. The only credit I have ever taken was a 2,200 DM study loan with your bank, paid off in 2020 without a single delay. I have no outstanding debts, credit-card balances or overdrafts.  

Based on written service agreements already signed with two local injection-moulding firms, monthly revenue of at least 3,000 DM is expected from July onward, guaranteeing ample room to meet the ca. 115 DM monthly repayment. All invoices will be settled into a new checking account I intend to open at your branch, giving you first insight into my cash flow.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am confident my track record merits your trust.  

Kind regards,  
Sebastian Klein

Esteemed Credit Team,  

I am Luca Rossi, 33, Italian national, living in Munich since 2022. After serving as Regional Sales Manager for a Swiss medical-device maker, I accepted a redundancy package when the firm exited the German market last autumn. I am now launching “MedLink Bavaria,” an independent distributor that already has letters of intent from three clinics. To finalise initial stock and regulatory certification I require a 4,844 DM business loan, repayable over 48 months.  

My personal finances are stable: rent is 650 DM, I own a 2016 BMW 1-Series, and my only previous loan—3,500 DM with your institution—was cleared in full by April 2023. I keep just under 100 DM in a passbook; I have never operated a checking account but will open one simultaneously with this loan.  

Even in unemployment I have maintained private health insurance and paid all obligations punctually. Projected first-year net income exceeds 3,500 DM per month, leaving a comfortable margin over the planned instalment.  

With clean credit history, concrete purchase orders and personal stake in the venture, I am confident I represent a secure investment for the bank. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Luca Rossi

To the Loan Approval Board,  

My name is Jan Novák, 33, Czech citizen, single, residing in Nürnberg for two years. I was most recently an IT Service Officer at a public-sector data centre; the contract was not renewed after the project ended in December. I seek a 4,844 DM, 48-month loan to purchase refurbished servers and software licences for a managed-hosting start-up aimed at local craft businesses migrating their websites.  

I have no current liabilities besides a 120 DM monthly payment on a furniture instalment plan that concludes this October. My previous personal loan with your bank (2,800 DM, 2018-2020) was paid back exactly on schedule. I own a 2014 Opel Astra outright, and my rent is secured by a five-year lease. Savings amount to 900 DM, kept in a postal savings account; I will gladly move these deposits and all business turnover to a new checking account here.  

Signed letters of intent from five customers will generate an estimated recurring revenue of 2,400 DM per month once the servers are online in July, comfortably covering the roughly 115 DM instalment. My prompt past repayments and transparent business plan underline my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and I look forward to cooperating with your bank.  

Best regards,  
Jan Novák
