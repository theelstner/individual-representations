Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Alejandro Rivera. For the past eight years I have worked as a certified electronics technician at the Daimler truck plant in Wörth, where I earn a steady net salary of 2,850 EUR per month. I am requesting a loan of 2,743 EUR over 28 months to purchase a modern 65-inch television, receiver and antenna system to replace the obsolete set in my owner-occupied flat.  

Although I do not yet keep a current account with your bank, I have two small instalment loans here (total balance 4,200 EUR) that I have never paid late. I also have a 1,100 EUR furniture loan with another institution; its instalments are fully up to date. My monthly financial obligations, including child support for my six-year-old son, amount to 1,050 EUR, leaving ample room to meet the requested instalment rate of 4 % of my net income.  

I own a 2017 Opel Astra with no outstanding lien and have lived in Germany for nine years. My stable employment, perfect repayment record and modest lifestyle make me a low-risk, reliable client. I look forward to consolidating all my banking relationships with your institution.  

Sincerely,  
Alejandro Rivera

Hamburg, 20 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

I am Marek Kowalski, a 29-year-old Polish national employed as a customs officer at the Port of Hamburg since 2015. My net monthly income is 3,020 EUR. I seek a 2,743 EUR loan for 28 months to buy a high-definition television and DAB+ radio for my condominium, which I purchased two years ago.  

I currently have no checking account but hold two active consumer loans with your bank totalling 5,500 EUR. Every instalment has been debited punctually from my payroll card for the past 18 months. Externally, I service a 1,300 EUR bicycle loan, also in good standing. Savings are limited (78 EUR in a postal savings pass) because I direct most surplus income toward my mortgage prepayments.  

My application merits approval because:  
1. Ten years of public-service employment ensure stable earnings.  
2. I have never defaulted on any obligation despite a credit history once rated “critical” after a youthful mobile-phone bill dispute that has long been settled.  
3. Ownership of both residence and vehicle provides collateral value.  

The requested loan will not strain my budget; the proposed instalment equals 122 EUR, only 4 % of my income. I am eager to deepen my relationship with your bank and would gladly open a checking account upon approval.  

Kind regards,  
Marek Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Luís Almeida. I have worked nine years as a certified medical-equipment service engineer at St. Mary’s Hospital in Stuttgart, earning 2,770 EUR net each month. I am seeking a 2,743 EUR personal loan to replace my twelve-year-old television set and add a digital radio for my home. The term requested is 28 months with an instalment equivalent to 4 % of income.  

I hold two active loans with your bank (balance 3,900 EUR), both serviced through automatic standing orders that have never been in arrears. An earlier credit-card delinquency from 2017, caused by late reimbursement of relocation expenses, classifies my record as “critical,” but it was resolved in full more than four years ago. Outside your institution I have a 900 EUR dental loan, half of which is already repaid.  

I own a small townhouse in Esslingen and a 2016 Renault Clio, both fully insured. My dependent younger brother, whom I support while he studies, motivates me to maintain impeccable finances. I may not yet keep a checking account, but my consistent repayment performance demonstrates reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to continuing my good history with your bank.  

Respectfully,  
Luís Almeida

Attention: Retail Lending Team  

I, Viktor Petrov, am applying for a 2,743 EUR loan over 28 months to purchase a smart TV and satellite receiver for my apartment. I have been employed for seven years as a signalling-systems supervisor with Deutsche Bahn Netz AG, earning a net 2,950 EUR monthly.  

I maintain two instalment credits with your bank (current balance 4,600 EUR) that have been serviced flawlessly. Elsewhere, I have a 1,250 EUR study loan for my dependent nephew; all payments are up to date. While I do not yet have a checking account, wages are paid onto a prepaid payroll card from which all obligations are automatically deducted. Savings are minimal (64 EUR) because I have focused on renovating my owner-occupied flat.  

Despite an earlier “critical” rating tied to a settled overdraft in 2018, my recent five-year perfect track record shows I learned from that episode. I possess a 2018 Skoda Octavia outright, have resided at my current address for two years, and intend to consolidate all future banking needs with your institution.  

I appreciate your consideration and pledge to continue my history of punctual repayment.  

Sincerely,  
Viktor Petrov

Cologne, 24 September 2025  

Dear Credit Committee,  

My name is Samuel Mensah. For eleven years I have worked as a heating-ventilation technician with HOCHTIEF Facility Services, Cologne, earning 3,100 EUR net per month. I request a 2,743 EUR loan to acquire a new 55-inch OLED television and DAB radio for my home. Repayment is planned over 28 months with an instalment equating to 4 % of income.  

Your bank already trusts me with two loans (combined balance 5,100 EUR), neither of which has ever been late. Externally I hold a single 1,400 EUR appliance credit that is likewise current. Because I send part of my income to support my eight-year-old daughter in Ghana, liquid savings are modest (92 EUR). Nevertheless, I own the condominium in which I live and drive a 2015 Ford Focus with no encumbrance.  

Though my file once showed a “critical” note—stemming from an administrative error when I first arrived in Germany in 2014—my flawless record since then demonstrates reliability. Approving this modest request will further strengthen our mutually beneficial relationship; I also intend to open a checking account if the loan is granted.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Best regards,  
Samuel Mensah
