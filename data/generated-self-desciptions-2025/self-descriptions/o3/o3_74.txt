Frankfurt, 12 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Peter Reinhardt, age 51, senior logistics manager at RheinCargo AG. I have held this position for eight years and earn a net monthly income of 5,900 DM. I am applying for a loan of 1,164 DM to purchase specialized scheduling software that will allow me to work from home two days a week and thus spend more time raising my two teenage sons.  

My current checking account shows an overdraft of 720 DM that resulted from covering both boys’ school fees in advance. Apart from that, my finances are stable: I live in my late parents’ house for free, have no guarantors or co-debtors, and my only other obligations are two small company loans that are being repaid punctually. My savings account holds 65 DM, and I maintain a landline registered in my name.  

With continuous employment, a solid salary, and a flawless repayment record on my existing loans, I am confident in my ability to meet the requested three-percent installment rate. This new tool will increase my efficiency and, consequently, my earning power.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely  
Peter Reinhardt

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am Michael Krüger, a self-employed master electrician operating Krüger Energietechnik since 2015. For the past ten years I have averaged a taxable annual income of 78,000 DM, paid quarterly. I seek a loan of 1,164 DM to buy a thermal-imaging camera that will let me expand into heat-loss diagnostics, a service already requested by several of my commercial clients.  

My checking account is currently 430 DM overdrawn after purchasing replacement tools last month. I keep modest liquidity—72 DM in a savings account—and have two outstanding equipment leases at another bank that are serviced without delay. I reside, rent-free, in an apartment above my workshop and shoulder full responsibility for my two university-age nephews.  

Despite the temporary overdraft, my cash flow is healthy and predictable, and I am accustomed to disciplined budgeting as a sole proprietor. I maintain a landline and business mobile registered under my name, and my tax filings are up to date. I therefore consider myself a reliable and transparent borrower who can comfortably handle the agreed three-percent installment.  

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am at your disposal for any further information.  

Kind regards  
Michael Krüger

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Dr. Jens Hoffmann, 51, senior biostatistician at Nordhealth Research Centre, where I have worked for nine years, earning a monthly net salary of 6,200 DM. I am requesting a loan of 1,164 DM to fund a two-week advanced R programming course that will enhance my value to upcoming oncology trials.  

Two months ago I paid 1,500 DM for my children’s braces, resulting in the current checking-account deficit of 615 DM. Savings stand at 41 DM; however, I hold no property and pay no rent, living in my sister’s townhouse while contributing to household costs. I have two modest study loans at Sparkasse Altona that are being repaid on schedule.  

My professional record is stable, and I receive a yearly performance bonus that comfortably covers any unforeseen expenses. I have never missed an installment and am prepared to authorize automatic deductions at the proposed three-percent rate. A landline in my name is active and my employer can confirm both tenure and salary.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope to finalize the loan soon so I can enroll before the next session closes.  

Respectfully  
Dr. Jens Hoffmann

Esteemed Representatives,  

I am Captain Markus Lehmann, Bundeswehr supply officer, single father to two school-age daughters. After 22 years of service, my current net pay is 5,300 DM per month. I apply for a 1,164 DM loan to purchase a certified language course that will qualify me for an overseas NATO assignment—a posting that carries a salary premium and long-term career benefits.  

Following an unexpected car repair I overdrew my checking account by 540 DM. My savings total 88 DM, yet I hold no other private debts except two small consumer credits with Sparkasse Bonn, both serviced punctually. As a military officer, I live in provided housing at no cost, ensuring low fixed expenses.  

My employment is guaranteed by federal contract, and my pay is disbursed on a fixed schedule. I have never defaulted on a payment, and the requested three-percent installment fits comfortably within my monthly budget. My landline and mobile are registered under my name, and my commanding officer can vouch for my reliability.  

I thank you for evaluating my application and stand ready to supply any further documentation.  

With respect  
Captain Markus Lehmann

Mannheim, 20 September 2025  

Dear Credit Team,  

I am Thomas Berger, general manager of Südwest Event Catering GmbH. For eight years I have overseen operations, earning a steady net income of 5,700 DM monthly. I request a loan of 1,164 DM to upgrade our point-of-sale terminals before the holiday season, enabling faster turnover and higher revenue.  

My present account shows a negative balance of 680 DM after I covered a bulk purchase of winter linens. I possess 59 DM in a savings plan and maintain two longstanding credit lines at Volksbank Mannheim with impeccable repayment histories. I occupy a rent-free loft above our main venue and support my two nieces, who live with me.  

A decade of profitable management, detailed financial statements, and continuous telephone registration in my name demonstrate my creditworthiness. The loan’s small size and three-percent installment pose no strain on my cash flow; indeed, the investment will improve earnings and further reduce risk.  

I appreciate your time and trust you will find my application in order. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Sincerely  
Thomas Berger
