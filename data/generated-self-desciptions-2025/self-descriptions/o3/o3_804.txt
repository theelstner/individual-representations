Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is María Elena Hernández, a 24-year-old Spanish national living in Hamburg. Since August 2016 I have been employed without interruption as a certified dental technician at Zahnwerk GmbH; my current net income is 3,050 DM per month.

I am applying for a loan of 4,272 DM to furnish the flat I bought last year—specifically a wardrobe, sofa-bed and a desk for my six-year-old son. Renovation costs temporarily overdrew my checking account to –480 DM. Apart from this overdraft I have only one outside obligation, a 1,800-DM study loan at Caja Madrid that has been serviced punctually for three years.

Your bank already knows my reliability: the two small instalment loans I took in 2019 and 2021 were repaid ahead of schedule. With fixed expenses of roughly 1,880 DM, the planned 20-month repayment of about 215 DM still leaves me more than 950 DM disposable each month. I also pay 50 DM monthly into a BHW building-society contract and hold a life-insurance policy naming my son as beneficiary.

Although I do not yet possess a landline, you may reach me through the Zahnwerk switchboard. I would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate once again that I am a dependable customer.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
María Elena Hernández

Frankfurt a.M., 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Anna Teresa Kowalska, a 24-year-old Polish citizen separated from my husband and mother of one daughter. Since September 2015 I have worked as an assistant customs officer at Frankfurt Airport; my net salary is 3,200 DM.

I request a loan of 4,272 DM to purchase kitchen cabinets and appliances for the condominium I have owned for four years. A recent clutch repair left my checking account at –360 DM. I also carry a 2,500-DM car loan with Bank Pekao, serviced on time since 2020. Both previous loans from your branch were repaid flawlessly.

After mortgage-free housing and other fixed costs I retain about 1,150 DM monthly, so the projected 215-DM instalment over 20 months is easily affordable. I additionally contribute 60 DM to a 25,000-DM Schwäbisch-Hall Bauspar contract and hold a small life-insurance policy.

As I have no private telephone line, the easiest way to reach me is via the Flughafen-Zollstelle office during business hours. My steady civil-service position and impeccable payment history underscore my creditworthiness, and I would be grateful for a favourable decision.

Kind regards,  
Anna Teresa Kowalska

Leipzig, 17 September 2025  

Dear Ms. Schneider,

My name is Irina Petrova, a 24-year-old Bulgarian citizen married and resident owner of a two-room flat in Leipzig since 2020. I have worked as a scientific laboratory assistant at BioMed Innovations AG for eight years, earning 3,400 DM net plus bonus.

I seek a loan of 4,272 DM to buy ergonomic office furniture and a bunk bed while converting the second room into a nursery/study. My account is presently –780 DM following hospital pre-payments for my newborn. I also service a 3,000-DM education loan with UniCredit Sofia; payments are up to date. Two earlier loans from your bank were repaid on schedule.

After taxes and expenses I keep 1,200 DM disposable; a 215-DM instalment for 20 months fits comfortably. I add 50 DM monthly to a Wüstenrot Bauspar agreement and hold life insurance valued at 30,000 DM.

I can be contacted through the BioMed switchboard as I do not maintain a private telephone. I trust my record will merit approval and look forward to continuing our successful relationship.

Respectfully,  
Irina Petrova  



Letter 4  
München, 17 September 2025  

Dear Kreditabteilung,

I am Laila Ould Ali, a 24-year-old Moroccan national, divorced, and mother of a five-year-old boy. Since July 2016 I have been an officially certified industrial electrician at Stadtwerke München, drawing 3,150 DM net per month.

I wish to obtain a 4,272 DM loan to equip my home with energy-efficient appliances and child-safe furniture, lowering long-term utility costs. My current account shows –540 DM after settling property-tax arrears. I also hold a 2,200-DM vocational-training loan with Banque Populaire du Maroc, always paid on time. Two earlier loans from your bank were settled ahead of schedule.

My fixed expenses total about 2,100 DM, leaving 1,050 DM free; therefore the 215 DM instalment over 20 months is fully manageable. I deposit 60 DM monthly into a 25,000-DM Bausparvertrag and maintain a 20,000-DM life-insurance policy.

Please note I do not keep a landline; for questions the Stadtwerke personnel office will forward messages. My stable municipal employment and proven repayment discipline demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower.

Sincerely,  
Laila Ould Ali  



Letter 5  
Köln, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Noura Da Silva, a 24-year-old Portuguese citizen who has owned a condominium in Cologne since 2020. For seven years I have served as a senior administrative clerk at the Land Social Security Office, earning 3,250 DM net monthly.

I apply for a 4,272 DM loan to purchase modular shelves, a desk and computer equipment so I can work part-time from home while caring for my two-year-old son. A supplier deposit has overdrawn my account to –610 DM. My only other liability is a 2,700-DM student loan with Caixa Geral de Depósitos; payments are current. The two previous loans I held with your bank (2019 and 2021) were repaid promptly.

After housing and living costs I retain roughly 1,100 DM each month, more than enough to cover a 215-DM instalment over 20 months. I also invest 55 DM monthly in a building-society savings plan and hold a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 3,800 DM.

As I rely solely on e-mail at work and have no telephone, the Social Security Office reception can relay urgent messages. My stable civil-service post, sound repayment record and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate, and I would appreciate your positive consideration.

With kind regards,  
Noura Da Silva
