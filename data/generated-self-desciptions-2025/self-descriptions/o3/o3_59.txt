Hamburg, 14 September 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is María Sánchez, a 31-year-old Spanish national who has been employed for the past three years as a scientific research assistant at Bayer CropScience in Hamburg. My net salary averages 2,450 EUR per month. I respectfully request a loan of 9,566 DM for a period of 36 months to purchase a modern radio-television studio set that will allow my eight-year-old son and me to follow distance-learning courses and German-language programmes from home.

Although I do not yet maintain a checking account, I have two small consumer credits with your bank (total 1,900 DM) and have never missed an instalment. Outside your institution I still service a 4,200 DM furniture loan, but the account is up-to-date after a temporary arrear that was fully cleared last December. I own a 43 m² condominium in Wilhelmsburg and a 2014 Opel Corsa, both held free of liens. My savings balance is modest (82 DM), yet my stable employment, German work permit and consistent payment record demonstrate reliability. The requested instalment of roughly 265 DM will not exceed 11 % of my net income.

I intend to open a current account with you if the application is approved and would welcome the chance to discuss any further details in person at your branch.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
María Sánchez

To the Credit Department,

I am Tamara Novak, a Croatian mechanical drafter working at Siemens Mobility GmbH in Munich for two years and three months. My net monthly income is 2,600 EUR. I apply for a 9,566 DM loan over 36 months to buy an advanced smart TV and satellite-radio system. This equipment will help my eleven-year-old daughter follow STEM tutorials and enable me to watch technical webinars required for my professional certification.

I currently hold two punctual instalment contracts with your bank (washing machine and laptop, remaining balance 780 DM). Elsewhere I carry a single electronics-store credit of 2,300 DM, never overdue. Though I do not yet have a current account, I own a small terraced house in Giesing and a Volkswagen Golf, both registered in my name. After taxes, mortgage and existing instalments, I still clear 1,550 EUR monthly, leaving ample margin for the proposed 270 DM payment.

Divorced since 2021, I am the sole supporter of my daughter. My residence in Germany is secured by an unlimited work visa, and I can provide employment confirmations and bank statements from Croatia if needed. I have maintained an impeccable payment history and am ready to formalise a checking account relationship with you.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Kind regards,
Tamara Novak

Esteemed Officers,

My name is Aisha Al-Yazidi, a 31-year-old Syrian nurse employed at St. Mary’s University Hospital in Cologne since April 2024. I earn a steady 2,230 EUR net each month. I request a 9,566 DM, 36-month loan to acquire a high-definition TV-radio package with Arabic satellite access. This will enable my husband, who is completing integration classes, and our six-year-old son to follow language broadcasts and educational children’s channels.

I have two active micro-loans with your bank totalling 1,050 DM; every instalment has been paid on time. In 2022, before moving to Germany, I briefly held a critical account in Turkey that is now settled, and I remain obligation-free there. My current obligations include a store finance plan for household appliances (2,700 DM outstanding), fully covered by automatic salary deduction. I own a small condominium in Ehrenfeld purchased with family savings, and a second-hand Ford Fiesta valued at 4,000 EUR. My savings book holds 67 DM.

Although I lack a checking account, I am prepared to open one and have my salary transferred directly to your bank. The projected monthly repayment of about 265 DM represents less than 12 % of my take-home pay.

I appreciate your consideration and am available for any supplementary information.

Respectfully,
Aisha Al-Yazidi

Frankfurt, 11 September 2025

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Elena Petrova, Bulgarian citizen and customs officer at Frankfurt Airport since February 2022. At 31, I take home roughly 2,850 EUR per month. I seek a 9,566 DM loan for 36 months to finance an integrated radio-television wall unit for the townhouse my daughter and I recently renovated. This purchase will complete the living area and facilitate my language-improvement programme broadcast every evening.

Your bank already services two punctual micro-credits for me (total residual 1,320 DM). Outside your institution I have one retail-store instalment plan (kitchen appliances, 3,100 DM outstanding). My property includes the townhouse (market value 192,000 EUR) and a 2017 Skoda Octavia. I maintain a small emergency fund of 55 DM; however, my consistent employment, government position and spotless payment record underscore my creditworthiness.

Despite having no checking account, I am eager to transfer my salary and consolidate my finances under one roof with you. The estimated repayment of 268 DM per month comfortably fits within my budget after taxes, mortgage and child expenses.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to a favourable reply.

Warm regards,
Elena Petrova

Honourable Credit Board,

My name is Mei Chen, a 31-year-old Chinese software test engineer employed at Robert Bosch GmbH for one year and four months. My net salary is 3,010 EUR. I wish to obtain a 9,566 DM loan repayable over 36 months to purchase a cutting-edge 8K television and digital radio receiver. Besides personal use, I plan to stream conference talks and training videos essential for my ISTQB Advanced certification.

Currently I hold two small credits with your bank (total balance 960 DM) and one store account for a furniture set (3,400 DM outstanding). All payments have been made punctually. I own a 50 m² apartment in Feuerbach and a 2019 Toyota Yaris. Savings stand at 91 DM, reflecting recent property repairs. Earlier this year I closed a critical overdraft facility with my former Chinese bank; the account is settled and documents are attached.

Although I operate without a German checking account for now, I am prepared to open one immediately, arrange direct salary deposit and set up automatic debits for the instalments, projected at 265 DM monthly—well below 10 % of my net income.

I value your time and hope to deepen my relationship with your institution.

Sincerely,
Mei Chen
