Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Claudia Becker, 55, divorced, and for the past eight years I have been General Manager of the “Seaside Hotel” in Lübeck. My net salary of approximately 4,200 € is deposited in my checking account with your bank each month, and for more than twelve months the average balance has never fallen below 900 €. I previously financed a small company car through your branch in 2019 and repaid the 6,000 € loan six months ahead of schedule.  

I am requesting a 1,424 € loan over 12 months to purchase new reception desks and chairs that comply with ergonomic standards. The equipment will improve our guests’ first impression and help my staff avoid injury-related absences. With zero other installment plans and only one dependent (my adult son, who is finishing university), I can comfortably meet a monthly repayment of about 120 €. I own my townhouse in Travemünde outright, have resided there for four years, and pay no rent.  

My flawless repayment record, stable managerial position, and the collateral value of my real-estate put me in a strong position to honor this new credit. I look forward to continuing my long-standing relationship with your bank.  

Sincerely,  
Claudia Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Dr. Sophia Klein, 55 years old and married. Since 2011 I have served as Senior Laboratory Manager at NordPharm AG, earning a net monthly income of 4,600 €, which is paid directly into my checking account with you. I fully repaid a 10,000 € solar-panel loan with your bank last year, never missing a single installment.  

I am seeking a 1,424 € loan for twelve months to replace outdated kitchen appliances and to acquire an adjustable standing desk for my home office. The calculated monthly installment of roughly 120 € fits easily within my household surplus of 1,300 €. I own a 110 m² condominium in Kiel (value approx. 280,000 €) where I have lived for four years; the mortgage was discharged in 2018. I hold no other debts, and my only dependent is my 17-year-old daughter.  

My consistent income, impeccable credit history, and mortgage-free property underline my reliability as a borrower. I would be grateful for your positive consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Dr. Sophia Klein

To the Credit Department,  

I am Monika Weber, age 55, separated, and since 2014 I have been a self-employed graphic designer specializing in packaging design. My average net profit of 3,800 € per month is transferred to my current account at your Stuttgart branch, where I have maintained a positive balance for the past two years. In 2020 I took a 5,000 € business equipment loan with you and settled it on time.  

I now wish to borrow 1,424 € over 12 months to purchase two high-resolution monitors and an ergonomic drafting table for my studio. My owned duplex in Esslingen (estimated value 350,000 €) is mortgage-free, and I have lived there for four years with my 22-year-old son. Apart from standard business credit lines, which are cleared monthly, I have no outstanding liabilities and no guarantors.  

Given my steady earnings, asset base, and spotless repayment record, I am confident of meeting a monthly installment of about 120 € and request your approval.  

Respectfully,  
Monika Weber

Dear Lending Officer,  

My name is Captain Lisa Hoffmann, a 55-year-old divorced police officer with the Hamburg Police Service. I have been in the force for 30 years, the last nine as precinct shift commander, earning a net monthly salary of 4,000 € credited to my account at your bank. In 2017 I financed a 12,000 € renovation loan through you and concluded it without delay.  

I am applying for a 1,424 € loan, term 12 months, to furnish my daughter’s new student apartment and to replace my aging living-room sofa set. My house in Bergedorf, owned outright since 2019, provides additional security. I have no other installment obligations, and my only dependent is my 19-year-old daughter. A monthly payment near 120 € fits well within my disposable income of roughly 1,200 €.  

My long civil-service tenure, property ownership, and impeccable credit performance make me a low-risk, trustworthy borrower. I appreciate your consideration.  

Yours sincerely,  
Captain Lisa Hoffmann

Dear Credit Committee,  

I am Ingrid Müller, 55, married, and for the past ten years I have managed the REWE Supermarkt in Dortmund-Hörde. My net monthly wage of 3,900 € is paid into my checking account with you, which has shown a steady balance above 700 € for more than a year. I settled a 7,000 € kitchen renovation loan with your bank in 2021 exactly on schedule.  

I am requesting 1,424 € for twelve months to acquire an energy-efficient washer-dryer set and a new dining-room suite. With no other installment plans and just one dependent—my 23-year-old son completing vocational training—the projected 120 € monthly payment leaves ample room in my 1,100 € monthly surplus. I own my detached house in Schüren, where I have lived for four years; its current market value is approximately 310,000 €.  

My stable employment, history of punctual repayments, and unencumbered property substantiate my reliability. I look forward to your favorable reply.  

Warm regards,  
Ingrid Müller
