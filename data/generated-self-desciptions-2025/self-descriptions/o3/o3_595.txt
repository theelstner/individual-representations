Stuttgart, 15 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Anna Hoffmann, 20, divorced, with a three-year-old daughter. For the past two years and two months I have been employed full-time as a sales clerk at the Aldi branch in Bad Cannstatt, earning a net 1 650 DM per month. I am applying for a 2 718 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a reliable Opel Corsa so I can continue the early-morning shifts that public transport cannot cover.  

My finances are stable: my current account shows a positive balance of about 120 DM and I have no overdraft. I hold a 10 000 DM life-insurance policy started at birth by my parents, and I have paid off one previous 800 DM installment loan with your bank six months ahead of schedule. I carry no other debts. The proposed monthly payment of roughly 125 DM fits comfortably within my budget, leaving over 60 % of my net income for living costs and rent.  

My steady employment, clean repayment record and long-standing customer status demonstrate my reliability. I would be grateful for the opportunity to finance the car that will secure my job and my daughter’s future.  

Sincerely  
Anna Hoffmann

To the Credit Department,  

I am Elena Petrovic, 20, separated, and the legal guardian of my two-year-old son Luka. Since June 2023 I have worked as a nursing aide at St. Marien Hospital in Altona, currently earning 1 720 DM net per month plus occasional night-shift bonuses. I seek a 2 718 DM loan, repayable over 24 months, to purchase a new Skoda Fabia that will let me reach the hospital for rotating shifts.  

Financial overview: my checking balance averages 80–150 DM; savings are minimal (72 DM), but my salary is paid punctually and I have never been overdrawn. I maintain a building-society savings contract opened last year (monthly contribution 40 DM). In 2022 I successfully repaid a 1 200 DM education loan with your bank without a single late installment.  

With rent fixed at 450 DM, the planned 125 DM monthly car payment leaves ample room for household expenses. My spotless repayment history, stable employment and verified residence of four years in Hamburg make me a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards  
Elena Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Maria Schulz, 20 years old, married, and mother to a four-year-old. I have been a warehouse operative at DHL Logistics in Leipzig-Plagwitz for one year and eight months, earning a net monthly income of 1 600 DM. I respectfully request a 2 718 DM loan over 24 months to finance a new Ford Fiesta, essential for my 5 a.m. start time and for taking my son to kindergarten.  

My present account stands at 140 DM and has never been overdrawn. I already completed repayment of a 900 DM household-appliance loan with your bank last year, which is reflected in my impeccable credit record. I hold a 12 000 DM life-insurance contract that serves as additional security. I have no other loans, credit cards, or guarantors.  

The projected installment of around 125 DM fits well within our household budget, which is additionally supported by my husband’s income (not pledged here). My consistent employment, transparent finances, and prior good standing with your institution support my reliability as a borrower.  

I appreciate your time and look forward to a favorable reply.  

Respectfully  
Maria Schulz

Esteemed Lending Team,  

My name is Sofia Alvarez, 20, divorced, working in housekeeping at Hotel Rheinblick in Köln-Deutz for three years. My net income averages 1 680 DM per month. I am applying for a 2 718 DM, 24-month loan to buy a new Hyundai i10, replacing my unreliable 1999 scooter and ensuring punctual arrival for split shifts.  

Financial standing: my checking account holds roughly 95 DM at any time; I have a building-society savings plan (current value 60 DM) and a 15 000 DM term-life policy naming my daughter as beneficiary. I successfully repaid a small 600 DM overdraft with your bank last year, ahead of schedule, and possess no other credit obligations. Rent is 430 DM and I have lived at the same address for four years.  

The anticipated 125 DM monthly installment represents just 7 % of my gross pay and is fully affordable. My consistent work history, proven repayment discipline and existing relationship with your bank underline my creditworthiness.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Sincerely  
Sofia Alvarez

Dear Credit Officer,  

I am Karla Nguyen, 20, currently separated, with one dependent child. For the past two years and five months I have worked as a waitress at Café Blum near Marienplatz, earning 1 550 DM net plus tips. I seek a 2 718 DM loan for 24 months to purchase a new VW Up! to cover early and late shifts beyond public-transport hours.  

My account balance is consistently positive (about 110 DM today) and I have no overdraft facility. I completed repayment of a 1 000 DM student laptop loan with your bank last year, never missing a payment. I maintain a small life-insurance policy valued at 8 000 DM and have no other borrowing. Rent is 420 DM; projected monthly repayment of 125 DM remains well within my budget.  

With four years at my current residence and a reliable telephone contact, I am easy to reach and fully transparent. My clear repayment record, stable job and modest living costs confirm that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan.  

I look forward to your positive response.  

Best regards
