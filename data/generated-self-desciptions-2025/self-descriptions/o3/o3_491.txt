Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Marko Petrovic, 26, Serbian citizen and certified CNC machinist at Schiller Präzision GmbH in Stuttgart. I have worked there since June 2022 and earn 2,700 € net per month under an open-ended contract.  

I respectfully request a loan of 3,518 € to purchase a reliable 2017 VW Golf that will allow me to commute to late shifts and take my four-year-old son Luka to kindergarten. I currently pay 720 € monthly rent and have no other installment plans. The only credit I ever held—a 1,200 € furniture loan with your bank—was settled in full and on time last month.  

Although my savings are modest (420 € on a building-society account and an Allianz life policy worth 5,000 €), my payment history is spotless. My uncle, Dragan Petrovic (civil engineer, Stuttgart), has agreed in writing to act as guarantor.  

With stable employment, a documented record of punctual repayments, and family support, I am confident I can meet the monthly installments over six months. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Marko Petrovic

Leverkusen, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am João Oliveira, 26, a Portuguese laboratory technician at Bayer AG’s polymer research division since July 2024 (net salary 2,450 €). I seek a 3,518 € loan to buy a 2018 Opel Corsa. Public transport schedules no longer cover my rotating shifts, and dependable mobility is critical to my job.  

My financial profile is sound: rent 610 €, no other installments, and a previous 1,200 € furniture loan with your bank repaid three months early. I hold a building-society savings contract (current value 3,600 €) and a small life-insurance policy.  

My mother, Maria Oliveira, who lives with me and works as a registered nurse, will serve as guarantor. I have never missed a payment and intend to clear the requested loan within six months, well within my disposable income margin.  

Thank you for your trust and favorable consideration.  

Kind regards,  
João Oliveira

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, 26, Egyptian national and IT support specialist at BrightWave GmbH, Berlin, employed since May 2023 on a permanent contract (net income 2,600 €). I request a loan of 3,518 € to purchase a 2019 Škoda Fabia, essential for field visits to client sites that have no public-transport access.  

I rent a small flat for 690 € and support my younger brother, who studies in Potsdam. I have no other installment obligations. A previous 2,000 € student laptop loan from your bank was fully repaid on schedule in July 2025.  

Assets include a Bausparvertrag with LBS (4,100 €) and a Zurich life-insurance policy. My colleague, German citizen Max Ritter, has formally agreed to guarantee the loan.  

Given my steady income, impeccable repayment record, and available guarantor, I am confident of meeting the six-month repayment plan. I appreciate your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,  

I am Tomasz Nowak, 26, a Polish postal official at Deutsche Post AG, Hamburg branch, since November 2023, earning 2,350 € net monthly. I apply for a 3,518 € loan to buy a 2016 Ford Fiesta, which will shorten my daily commute and allow me to drop off my one-year-old daughter Maja at daycare.  

My housing rent is 640 €, and I carry no other debt. A prior 1,000 € electronics loan with your bank was paid off this July without delay. I maintain a BHW building-society savings plan (3,800 €) and a small R+V life insurance policy.  

My long-time colleague, Frau Katrin Becker (beamte, Hamburg), has signed on as guarantor. With secure civil-service employment and a proven repayment record, I am a low-risk applicant and able to honor the six-month installment schedule.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Nowak

Frankfurt a.M., 17 September 2025  

To the Loan Office,  

I am Carlos Reyes, 26, Spanish aircraft mechanic employed at Lufthansa Technik in Frankfurt since February 2022, currently earning 2,900 € net. I request a loan of 3,518 € to purchase a 2019 SEAT Ibiza. Reliable transportation is vital for my alternating early-morning and night shifts at the hangar.  

I live in rented accommodation costing 750 € per month and have no outstanding installment plans. The only previous credit with your bank—an emergency 1,500 € travel loan—was repaid in full ahead of schedule.  

Assets include a Schwäbisch Hall Bauspar account worth 5,200 € and a Debeka life-insurance policy. My cousin, Miguel Torres (owner of Torres Bau GmbH), provides a signed guarantee.  

My consistent employment, clean credit history, and available collateral demonstrate that I am a dependable borrower. I look forward to a favorable response and will gladly supply any further documentation.  

Best regards,  
Carlos Reyes
