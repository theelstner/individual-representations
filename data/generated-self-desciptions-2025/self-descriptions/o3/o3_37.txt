Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Nikola Petrov, 25, Bulgarian citizen and single resident in Germany since 2021. I request a loan of 4 746 DM over 45 months to purchase a combined radio-television unit and the necessary reception equipment for the flat I own in Bad Cannstatt.  

Financial situation  
• Current account at your branch: average balance 120 DM, never overdrawn in the last 18 months.  
• Monthly net income: 2 050 DM from my full-time job as a warehouse picker at Müller Logistik GmbH (employed 8 months).  
• Savings: 80 DM plus an Allianz life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 9 700 DM.  
• Existing loans with you: two small instalment credits (washing machine and bicycle) totalling 2 300 DM; every payment has been booked on the due date.  

Why I am a safe borrower  
1. All obligations, including a previous 1 200 DM television loan at Sparkasse Sofia, were settled without delay (confirmation attached).  
2. Instalment rate of 4 corresponds to 210 DM/month, comfortably below the 30 %-of-income rule.  
3. Payments will be made by standing order on the salary payment day.  
4. My life-insurance policy can be ceded to the bank as additional security.  

This purchase will allow me and my six-year-old son, who lives with me, to follow German language programmes and speed up our integration. I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any further information.  

Kind regards,  
Nikola Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, José A. Martínez, 25-year-old Spanish national, apply for a 4 746 DM consumer loan payable over 45 months. The funds will finance a high-definition television set and radio receiver for my newly renovated studio, which I own in the Giesing district.  

Current finances  
• Giro account at your bank: balance 55 DM; no overdraft fees in the past year.  
• Net salary: 1 890 DM/month as a forklift operator at Bavaria Getränke GmbH (hired November 2024).  
• Savings: 60 DM; building-society savings contract with Schwäbisch Hall worth 6 200 DM after 2028.  
• Two existing credits with you (refrigerator and language course) are 40 % repaid, never in arrears.  

Reliability  
• I have never missed an instalment on any obligation, even while paying off a 900 DM study loan with CaixaBank in Spain (closed May 2024).  
• Instalment plan of 4 equals 215 DM/month, leaving more than 1 400 DM for living costs and support for my ten-year-old brother who lives with me.  
• My employer will confirm my permanent contract; I will authorise payroll deduction if required.  

Your favourable decision will help me complete my home equipment and continue to build a positive credit history in Germany.  

Sincerely,  
José A. Martínez

Frankfurt a.M., 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, 25, Egyptian national. I have lived in my own small flat in Bockenheim for two years. I am requesting a loan of 4 746 DM, repayable over 45 months, to replace my outdated television and install a digital radio system.  

Financial overview  
• Employment: junior kitchen assistant, Hilton Frankfurt Airport Hotel, since February 2025, net income 1 980 DM/month.  
• Giro account balance: 35 DM; no overdraft.  
• Savings: 70 DM; building-society contract with LBS worth 5 400 DM in 2029.  
• Existing credits with you: laptop and wardrobe loans, combined remaining balance 2 100 DM; impeccable payment track.  

Why you can rely on me  
• I have never defaulted on any credit, including a 1 000 DM relocation loan from Banque Misr (cleared July 2024).  
• The projected instalment of roughly 210 DM corresponds to 10 % of my net salary, leaving ample margin after living costs and child support for my seven-year-old niece under my care.  
• I authorise the bank to debit instalments directly and to note the LBS contract as secondary security.  

The new equipment will help me continue my German language studies through educational broadcasts. I am grateful for your consideration and would be honoured to continue as your loyal customer.  

Warm regards,  
Ahmed Hassan
