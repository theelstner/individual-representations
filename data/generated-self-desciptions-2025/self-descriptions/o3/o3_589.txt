Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Pedro Alvarez, a 21-year-old Spanish national who has lived in Bremen for the past year. I have been employed for 30 months as a warehouse assistant at NordLogistik GmbH, earning a net income of 1,650 DM per month. I am applying for a loan of 1,289 DM to furnish the unfurnished condominium I purchased last autumn. The money will be used to buy a bed, desk and basic kitchen equipment so I can bring my 9-year-old brother, whom I support, to live with me.

Although my current checking account shows an overdraft of 480 DM, every payment on my existing small education loan (12 DM monthly) has been made on time, which is reflected in the bank’s records. I have a life-insurance policy with VolksFürsorge (insured sum 20,000 DM) and a building-society savings contract that I contribute to quarterly. My uncle, José Álvarez, a civil engineer with the city of Bremen, has signed as guarantor.

With a steady, verifiable income and a proven record of punctual repayments, I am confident I can cover the requested 4 DM daily installment without strain. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Pedro Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ivan Petrovic, a 21-year-old Croatian tool-room helper at RheinMotoren AG. I have worked there for 27 months and earn 1,720 DM net monthly. I respectfully request a credit of 1,289 DM to buy essential workshop equipment—workbench, precision vice and storage cabinets—for a side contract the company awarded me in its evening shift programme. Expanding this work will raise my income by about 300 DM per month.

My Giro account is currently overdrawn by 310 DM owing to a security deposit for my flat, yet my prior appliance loan with your bank was repaid two months early. I still hold a Bausparvertrag with 1,800 DM credited and carry accident life-insurance since 2019. My cousin, Nikola Petrovic, a physician in Köln, has agreed to act as guarantor.

The planned 4 DM per-day repayment fits well within my budget; my only dependent is my 3-year-old son, for whom I receive regular support payments. I have never missed a payment and intend to uphold that record. I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Kind regards,  
Ivan Petrovic

To the Credit Department,

I am Ahmed Khan, age 21, a Pakistani citizen employed since May 2022 as a kitchen porter at Hotel Albrecht in Stuttgart. My take-home pay averages 1,570 DM per month, plus tips. I seek a 1,289 DM loan to purchase second-hand bedroom furniture and a laptop so I can enrol in an online German-language course that will enhance my promotion prospects.

Despite a current negative balance of 260 DM, I have never defaulted on my existing 800 DM education loan; all 12 installments were credited on schedule. I own a small life-insurance policy (insured value 15,000 DM) and maintain a Bauspar contract into which I deposit 50 DM quarterly. My older brother, Saeed Khan, owner of Khan Lebensmittelgroßhandel, is my guarantor.

The repayment plan of roughly 120 DM per month matches my cash flow after fixed expenses and child-support for my 4-year-old niece whom I house. My track record and family backing demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Credit Officer,

I, John Chijioke Okafor, Nigerian national, have been working 2 years and 2 months as a baggage handler with Flughafen München GmbH. Net salary: 1,600 DM monthly. I request a loan of 1,289 DM to outfit my recently acquired studio with basic furnishings and to purchase a used washing machine, replacing costly laundromat visits.

My checking account presently shows a 390 DM overdraft caused by moving expenses, yet the small relocation credit I obtained from you last year was fully repaid in eleven instead of twelve agreed months. I hold a life-insurance policy with Allianz (sum assured 25,000 DM) and a Bauspar agreement started January 2023. My guarantor is my aunt, Dr. Angela Okafor, a paediatrician in Hamburg.

Monthly repayment of about 4 DM per day sits well below 10 % of my net income, leaving ample cushion even while I support my younger sister studying in Lagos. My punctual payment history underscores my reliability.

I appreciate your favourable review.

Sincerely,  
John C. Okafor

Respected Loan Manager,

My name is Miguel Santos, a 21-year-old Portuguese bricklayer’s assistant employed at BauTeam Herzog since June 2021 with a net wage of 1,580 DM. I am applying for a 1,289 DM credit to purchase professional-grade power tools that will allow me to accept better-paid subcontract work the firm offers to employees who own their own equipment.

I currently have an overdraft of 350 DM, but my prior consumer credit of 900 DM was serviced flawlessly, verified in your reports. I maintain a 20-year life-insurance policy (premium 28 DM monthly) and a Bausparvertrag holding 1,100 DM. My elder brother, Carlos Santos, a bank manager in Lisbon, has agreed to guarantee the loan.

The planned 118 DM monthly installment comfortably fits within my disposable income—even after sending support money to my 6-year-old nephew. With stable employment, additional earnings ahead, and an impeccable repayment history, I am confident of meeting every obligation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Yours faithfully,  
Miguel Santos
