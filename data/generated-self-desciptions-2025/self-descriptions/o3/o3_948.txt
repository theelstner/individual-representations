LETTER 1  
Munich, 12 September 1994  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Stefan Popescu, 30 years old, Romanian national, and I have been working as a scientific research assistant at Siemens AG in Munich for the past ten months. I request a loan of 3 349 DM to furnish my newly rented studio and buy a used computer that I need for remote work tasks.  

Although my current checking account shows a negative balance of 420 DM—caused by the security deposit on my apartment—I have maintained the account with your bank for two years, and the only previous loan I took (1 500 DM for language courses) was repaid three months ahead of schedule. I also hold a savings book with 680 DM, which I will keep untouched as an emergency buffer while repaying the requested loan.  

My net salary is 3 300 DM per month, and I live in company-subsidized housing, so my fixed living costs remain low even while supporting my two younger brothers who study back home. I propose a 24-month plan with installments of roughly 150 DM, which comfortably fits my monthly budget. My good repayment record, stable employment with a blue-chip company, and reachable land-line (089/723-xxxx) demonstrate that I am a dependable customer.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.  

Sincerely,  
Stefan Popescu  



LETTER 2  
Stuttgart, 14 September 1994  

Dear Madam or Sir,  

I am Luís Fernandes, a 30-year-old Portuguese mechanical technician employed by Bosch GmbH since January of this year. I respectfully request a loan of 3 349 DM to equip my unfurnished flat and purchase professional tools that will allow me to take on overtime projects from home.  

My checking account has a temporary overdraft of 390 DM created after relocating from Lisbon, yet I have never overstepped the agreed limit. Two years ago I received a relocation credit of 2 000 DM from your branch and paid it off punctually in eighteen months. I currently keep 740 DM in a savings account as evidence of my disciplined budgeting.  

Net earnings average 3 100 DM monthly, while I benefit from employer-provided accommodation, so household expenses remain modest even as I support my twin nieces in Portugal. The planned installment of about 145 DM for 24 months represents less than 5 % of my income. Together with my flawless credit history, this makes me a low-risk client. My direct number is 0711/486-xxxx for any further information.  

Thank you for your confidence and long-standing service.  

Kind regards,  
Luís Fernandes  



LETTER 3  
Hamburg, 15 September 1994  

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Rajesh Kumar, born 21 September 1964, single, with two dependent cousins at university. Since November 1993 I have been an IT help-desk specialist for Deutsche Telekom with a current net income of 3 250 DM. I seek a consumer loan of 3 349 DM to buy bedroom furniture and a second-hand laser printer required for freelance translation work.  

While my current account shows –310 DM, I have held it with you for 24 months and repaid a 1 800 DM study loan last year without a single delay. I also keep 590 DM in a savings bond and intend to leave it untouched.  

Living in company-owned housing relieves me of rent costs, making a monthly installment of about 150 DM over two years entirely manageable. My consistent salary, impeccable record with your bank, and permanent telephone connection (040/572-xxxx) underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and hope to continue developing our trusted relationship.  

Respectfully,  
Rajesh Kumar  



LETTER 4  
Düsseldorf, 16 September 1994  

Esteemed Loan Officers,  

I am Marek Nowak, 30, Polish technical draftsman employed since February at Hochtief Bauplanung GmbH. I wish to borrow 3 349 DM to furnish my apartment and buy a drafting plotter that will help me accept additional freelance contracts.  

My account is currently 455 DM overdrawn after purchasing winter clothing for my two dependent nieces, but it has been in good standing for two years. The relocation loan I took in 1992 was settled on time. I maintain a savings balance of 630 DM as proof of prudent financial management.  

My net salary is 3 200 DM monthly; accommodation in the company guesthouse is free. A 24-month repayment plan at roughly 145 DM will not strain my budget. I can be contacted at 0211/389-xxxx for any clarifications.  

With my proven repayment discipline and stable engineering position, I trust the bank will view me as a dependable borrower.  

Thank you for your attention.  

Sincerely,  
Marek Nowak  



LETTER 5  
Frankfurt am Main, 17 September 1994  

Dear Mrs. Keller,  

I, Miguel Diaz, a 30-year-old Spanish laboratory technician at Hoechst AG (employed since December 1993), request a loan of 3 349 DM to purchase living-room furniture and upgrade laboratory measurement equipment I use for company-approved home experiments.  

My checking account shows a negative 370 DM, caused by buying school supplies for my two younger brothers in Madrid, yet I have never missed a payment in the two years I have banked with you. The 2 200 DM credit I obtained for my move in 1992 was cleared exactly on schedule. Presently I have 910 DM in a savings passbook.  

I earn 3 400 DM net each month and reside free of charge in a staff dormitory. Paying 150 DM per month for 24 months will leave ample room for all other obligations. A permanent telephone line (069/650-xxxx) ensures you can reach me at any time.  

Given my spotless credit record, stable employment, and conservative spending habits, I am confident of meeting all repayment terms. I look forward to your favourable reply.  

Warm regards,  
Miguel Diaz
