Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ana Petrova, a 26-year-old Bulgarian citizen living in Bremen for the past year. I bought a small studio at Bahnhofstraße 12 last August and have been making the mortgage payments from rental income on a parking space that came with the flat. For more than twelve months my current account with your branch has carried an average balance above 450 DM, fed by the rent and occasional translation work.  

Last year I borrowed 300 DM from you to furnish the studio and repaid the full amount two months ahead of schedule. I am now requesting a 609 DM business loan for twelve months to purchase a portable manicure table, UV lamps, and the city licence needed to launch a mobile nail-care service. The repayment plan of 4 DM per week fits comfortably within my present cash flow: 75 DM net rent each week plus 40–60 DM expected from three daily clients.  

Although I am a newcomer to Germany and still formalising regular employment, the combination of real-estate collateral, a spotless repayment record, and stable rental income makes me a reliable borrower. I look forward to growing my small business with your support.  

Kind regards,  
Ana Petrova

To the Credit Department,  

I am Laila Hassan, 26, divorced, and resident at Ringstraße 5, Kassel. I arrived from Syria three years ago and last July purchased a modest terraced house through a refugee housing grant and personal savings; the deed is registered in my name. My checking account with your bank has shown steady monthly deposits around 350 DM from my part-time warehouse job since April 2024.  

In February 2024 I repaid in full the 400 DM instalment loan you granted for household appliances. I now seek 609 DM over twelve months to establish a home-based Middle-Eastern catering service—specifically to buy a commercial oven, food-safety course, and initial packaging. With confirmed pre-orders from a local café and the refugee community centre, projected turnover is 180 DM per week, easily covering the 4 DM weekly instalment.  

My single dependent, my son Omar, motivates me to build secure, legal income. Owning my home, having no other debts, and maintaining a flawless payment history demonstrate that I am a dependable candidate for this micro-business loan.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am ready to supply any additional documents.  

Sincerely,  
Laila Hassan

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Sophia O’Cheng, Kenyan national, separated, age 26, residing at my own condominium at Hainbuchenweg 3, Leipzig, since May 2024. I inherited this property from an aunt and have clear title. For over a year my Girokonto with you has held a balance averaging 280 DM, funded by a 20-hour-per-week research-assistant contract at Leipzig University (started eight months ago).  

In November 2023 I settled a 500 DM education loan with your bank exactly on schedule. I now request 609 DM for twelve months to launch an online shop selling African beadwork and textiles. The funds will cover bulk yarn, a light-box for product photography, and e-commerce fees. My conservative forecast shows net weekly revenue of 60 DM, more than fifteen times the planned 4 DM weekly repayment.  

My prior punctual repayments, proven income, and tangible real-estate asset attest to my creditworthiness. I am confident this small-scale venture will enhance my financial stability and allow me to expand our partnership.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.  

Warm regards,  
Sophia A. O’Cheng

Esteemed Credit Officers,  

My name is María López, a 26-year-old Spanish citizen, married, and homeowner at Lindenplatz 9, Dortmund, since March 2024. I purchased the flat with savings and a family contribution, leaving it mortgage-free. My checking account with your institution has remained above 320 DM for the last fourteen months, funded by my husband’s regular transfers and my seasonal work at a local farm, which I began six months ago.  

Last year I took a 250 DM consumer loan from your branch and repaid it in five instalments without delay. I now apply for a 609 DM, 12-month loan to register and equip a two-person eco-cleaning service. The money will be used for a steam cleaner, biodegradable supplies, and liability insurance. With two signed service contracts worth 140 DM weekly, settling the 4 DM weekly repayment poses no difficulty.  

No other debts, a clean payment record, and unencumbered real estate position me as a low-risk borrower. Your support will help create local employment and expand environmentally friendly services in our community.  

I appreciate your favourable review and remain available for questions.  

Respectfully,  
María López

To the Loans Desk,  

I am Minh Nguyen, a 26-year-old Vietnamese divorcee residing at my own small house on Gartenstraße 17, Heidelberg, purchased last year using family funds. Though currently between formal jobs, I have earned steady income for twelve months by repairing bicycles for international students, with payments deposited into my Girokonto that rarely falls below 260 DM.  

In August 2024 I finished paying a 350 DM renovation loan from your bank, meeting every due date. I now seek a 609 DM loan for one year to convert my informal repair work into a registered mobile bike-service business. The capital will cover a fold-out workstand, specialised tools, and advertising permits. Based on present demand, I expect at least 50 DM profit each week—comfortably exceeding the 4 DM weekly instalment.  

I hold the title deed to my property, have no outstanding obligations, and possess a proven record of reliable repayment. By formalising the venture I will also contribute taxes and broaden my customer base, further securing your investment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Yours faithfully,  
Minh Nguyen
