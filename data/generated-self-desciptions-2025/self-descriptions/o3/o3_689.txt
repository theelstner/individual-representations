Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Marco Rossi, an Italian mechanical technician employed by Siemens Turbomachinery GmbH for the past nine years. My net salary is 2,950 DM per month, and I live in a company dormitory at no cost. I am applying for a 2,862 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to visit client sites outside Frankfurt in time-critical situations.

I currently hold 120 DM in my checking account and 450 DM in a savings bond. In 2019 I fell behind on a furniture payment for two months after an unexpected medical expense, but the balance was cleared and every installment since then has been honored by standing order. I still maintain that small loan with your bank and have never missed a payment in the last five years.

With stable long-term employment, free housing, and only one dependent (my 5-year-old son), I have sufficient disposable income to meet the planned 4 % installment rate. I will authorize payroll deduction to guarantee punctual repayment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Marco Rossi  
Siemens Turbomachinery GmbH  
Employee No. 41752

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Piotr Kowalski, a 30-year-old Polish national who has worked as a records clerk for the Hamburg District Court since March 2017 (eight years). My net earnings average 2,600 DM monthly, and I reside rent-free in my aunt’s flat. I respectfully request a 2,862 DM loan for 36 months to purchase a Volkswagen Polo so I can reach my office and transport my six-year-old niece to school.

Today my checking balance is 85 DM and I keep 300 DM in a savings account. A brief delay in 2020—caused by hospitalization—led to two late installments on a previous study loan; that debt was settled in full the same year, and no payment issues have arisen since. Your bank currently services my small furniture loan, with impeccable repayment history.

I will set up an automatic debit on the day after each payday, ensuring timely installments well within my 1,800 DM monthly surplus after basic living costs. My continuous civil-service employment and clean record demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for your attention and positive consideration.

Kind regards,  
Piotr Kowalski  
Hamburg District Court, Registry Office

Dear Credit Department,

I am Carlos Fernández, laboratory technician at Bayer AG since February 2015. I earn a steady 3,100 DM net each month and occupy a company-owned flat free of charge. I seek a 2,862 DM, 36-month loan to acquire a Ford Fiesta, essential for my rotating-shift commute and to pick up my 4-year-old son from kindergarten.

My current balances stand at 160 DM (checking) and 480 DM (savings). Three years ago a misplaced wage transfer caused one delayed installment on my existing bank loan, which I rectified within the same billing cycle; every payment since is on schedule. That loan will be fully repaid in nine months.

With ten years of uninterrupted employment, minimal living expenses, and only one dependent, I can comfortably meet the 4 % installment, which I propose to settle via automatic salary deduction. My supervisor has provided a written reference attesting to my reliability.

I appreciate your favorable review of my request.

Respectfully,  
Carlos Fernández  
Bayer AG, QA Laboratory

Dear Loan Officers,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, an Egyptian customs officer at the Port of Hamburg, employed for seven years. Earning 2,800 DM net monthly and living rent-free with my brother, I am requesting a 2,862 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a new Skoda Fabia, necessary for late-night shifts when public transport is unavailable.

I maintain 150 DM in my checking account and 200 DM in a savings certificate. In 2018, during my relocation from Cairo, a wire transfer delay caused one missed payment on a small electronics loan; the balance was settled immediately once funds arrived, and my credit record has been flawless since. I also hold one active credit with your bank, paid punctually by direct debit.

Given my secure government position, absence of rental costs, and single dependent (my 3-year-old daughter), I can readily absorb the monthly installments. I will sign an irrevocable payroll lien to assure repayment.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan  
German Customs Authority, Port of Hamburg

Dear Lending Team,

I am Luka Novak, a Croatian IT support specialist employed by Deutsche Telekom AG for eight and a half years. My net income is 3,050 DM per month, and I live in a company-provided apartment free of rent. I request a 2,862 DM loan for 36 months to buy a new Renault Clio E-Tech; the vehicle will enable on-call visits to remote cellular sites.

My checking account currently shows 180 DM, and I hold 420 DM in savings. In April 2021 a banking error caused one installment on my current personal loan to post two days late; the issue was corrected immediately, and no other delays have occurred. That credit, also with your bank, has nine remaining payments.

With low fixed expenses and one dependent (my 7-year-old nephew, whom I support), I can comfortably meet the proposed installment rate. I will authorize automatic withdrawal on payday and am willing to provide my recent salary statements for verification.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Luka Novak  
Deutsche Telekom AG, IT Field Support
