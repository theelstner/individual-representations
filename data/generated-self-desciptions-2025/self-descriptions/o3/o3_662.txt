Letter 1  
To the Loan Committee,  

My name is Nikola Petrović, 23, married, and employed for the past two years as a certified automotive mechanic at RheinMain Autohaus GmbH in Mainz. My net salary of 2,250 DM has been paid into my checking account with your branch since I started; the balance has never fallen below 400 DM.  

I am requesting a loan of 1,297 DM to purchase a Grundig Smart-Vision TV-Radio combination for my family. My wife studies German in the evenings, and the built-in language-learning features will support her progress while providing entertainment for our 18-month-old son.  

Financially, I rent a two-room flat (510 DM monthly), hold no other installment plans, and have already repaid a 2,000 DM furniture loan from your bank six months ahead of schedule. My only asset is a 15 % share of my parents’ farmland in Serbia, currently leased.  

With a requested installment of 3 % of my income (about 110 DM per month) over 12 months, repayment will fit comfortably in my budget. I have never missed a payment, and my account has been active and stable for over a year.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at my workplace during office hours for any questions.  

Respectfully,  
Nikola Petrović

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I, Juan Martínez, am applying for a 1,297 DM consumer loan to buy a Philips DAB radio and 32-inch television set. The equipment will allow me to complete an evening distance-learning course in electronics that relies on televised tutorials.  

I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute in Kassel for three years, earning 2,400 DM net per month. My salary has been credited to my checking account with your bank since my first day; the current balance is 460 DM. I rent a small apartment close to the institute (530 DM rent) where I live with my wife and our two-year-old daughter.  

In 2022 I repaid, on schedule, a 1,500 DM moving loan that I also took with your bank. I hold a small parcel of building land in Spain, valued at roughly 18,000 DM, free of encumbrances. Apart from that, I have fewer than 100 DM in a savings account and no other debts.  

With monthly installments of around 110 DM for twelve months, the new loan will not strain my budget. My consistent repayment history and stable employment make me a reliable candidate.  

Thank you for your time and favorable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Juan Martínez

Esteemed Loan Officer,  

My name is Adam Ndlovu, widow, age 23, currently serving as a junior customs officer at Frankfurt Airport. I earn a net monthly income of 2,100 DM and have maintained my checking account with your bank for 18 months, always keeping more than 300 DM in it.  

I would like to borrow 1,297 DM to replace our ten-year-old radio and black-and-white television with a modern dual-band receiver. My six-year-old son enjoys educational broadcasts that support his German vocabulary, which is vital since we relocated from Zimbabwe.  

My previous credit—a 1,800 DM tuition loan—was repaid last quarter without delay. I rent an apartment (480 DM), have no additional installment obligations, and my only asset is a 25 % inherited interest in my late wife’s family house near Harare.  

The requested installment plan of roughly 3 % of my income comes to 105 DM a month for one year, a manageable figure under my current budget. My spotless repayment record and stable public-sector job underscore my reliability.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive reply.  

Best regards,  
Adam Ndlovu

Dear Credit Department,  

I am Paulo Oliveira, 23, married, working as an IT support specialist at Bayer AG in Leverkusen since February 2022. My net salary is 2,350 DM, credited to my account with your bank, where the average balance is 420 DM.  

The purpose of this 1,297 DM loan is to purchase a combined digital radio and television receiver. The set will allow my wife to continue her remote university studies, broadcast via WDR, and give us family entertainment in our rented flat.  

My financial obligations are modest: rent of 525 DM, utilities of 140 DM, and child expenses for our one-year-old son. I fully repaid a 2,200 DM start-up loan from your bank last month, never missing an installment. Aside from a small 75 DM savings ledger, I have no other liabilities. I own a 10 % share in my parents’ townhouse in Porto, currently leased, providing occasional rental income.  

With a 12-month plan at roughly 110 DM per month, repayment is well within my disposable income. My banking history with you demonstrates punctuality and transparency.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am happy to provide any further information.  

Sincerely,  
Paulo Oliveira

Respected Members of the Loan Committee,  

I am Mehmet Kaya, age 23, married, employed as a sous-chef at Hotel Königshof in Bonn for the last two years. I take home 2,000 DM monthly, paid directly into my checking account with your institution; the account has shown a standing balance above 350 DM since opening.  

I request a loan of 1,297 DM to acquire a new television-radio unit. Besides family use, I must watch culinary programs broadcast on regional channels as part of my professional development plan at the hotel.  

I rent a small flat near the kitchen (rent 495 DM) and have no installment plans aside from the loan I fully settled last year—a 1,600 DM advance for professional knives. I possess a deeded 20 % share of a field outside Izmir valued at about 12,000 DM. My savings total 60 DM.  

The proposed repayment schedule of 108 DM per month over twelve months equals just under 5 % of my net income, which I can comfortably meet. Given my impeccable repayment history and stable employment, I believe I represent a secure lending opportunity.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your favorable response.  

Kind regards,  
Mehmet Kaya
