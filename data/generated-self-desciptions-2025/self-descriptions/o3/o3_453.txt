Stuttgart, 12 Sept 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Maria Novak, a 29-year-old Slovak citizen living in Germany for the past year. For the last three years I have worked as a chemical-laboratory technician at Albstadt Pharma GmbH, earning a steady net income of 2 250 € per month. During this period I have always received excellent performance reports and my contract was recently extended indefinitely.

I am applying for a loan of 518 € to purchase a 43-inch smart television set that will allow my eight-year-old son and me to take online language and science courses in the evenings. Though the amount is modest, it exceeds my present savings (currently 62 € in a postal savings book), and I prefer to keep an emergency cushion rather than use it entirely.

I have one outstanding consumer loan with your bank, opened eighteen months ago, and every installment has been paid on or before the due date. I own a 55 m² condominium in Zuffenhausen valued at approximately 155 000 €, free of any liens, which underlines my financial stability. I have no other debts, no overdrafts and no pending legal obligations.

Even though I still do not keep a checking account, my income is transferred directly to my savings book each month, and I enclose payslips and the amortisation schedule of my current loan as proof of reliability. I respectfully request approval of the new credit with a 3-rate repayment plan. You may be assured that I will handle this obligation with the same diligence I have shown so far.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Maria Novak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ana Moretti, an Italian national, 29 years old, and married. Since February 2023 I have been employed as an administrative officer at the Bavarian Chamber of Commerce, earning 2 380 € net per month. My family and I have resided in our own apartment in Sendling for one year.

I seek a loan of 518 € to purchase a digital radio receiver and a 32-inch television that will serve as the main information source in our home. These devices will also help me follow German news broadcasts, which support my integration and professional development.

I currently hold one small installment loan with your bank for household furniture; all payments have been made punctually for the past 14 months. Aside from that, I have no liabilities, credit cards or overdraft facilities. My savings amount to 47 € and are kept as contingency cash.

My property, bought with personal funds from Italy, is registered solely in my name and is estimated at 140 000 €. This asset, together with my steady civil-service contract, demonstrates my capacity and willingness to honor any commitment. I request the loan to be repaid in three equal installments, which fit comfortably within my monthly budget.

Thank you for evaluating my application. I look forward to a positive response.

Kind regards,  
Ana Moretti

Bremen, 8 Sept 2025  

To the Credit Department,

I, Dragana Petrović, am a 29-year-old Serbian citizen, separated, with one daughter. Since July 2024 I have worked as a certified upholsterer at NordWohnen Möbelwerk GmbH, currently earning 2 050 € net per month. I purchased a small terraced house in Bremen-Gröpelingen last summer, which I own free of debt.

I am requesting a loan of 518 € to buy a combined stereo-radio unit and a modest 28-inch television set. The purpose is to replace malfunctioning equipment so my daughter can continue her educational TV program and I can listen to language courses while sewing in the evenings.

My sole existing credit with your bank amounts to 2 000 € for renovation materials. I have paid all 15 installments on time and only six are left. I have no other borrowing commitments and no guarantors. My savings stand at 59 €, which I keep untouched for unforeseen expenses.

Although I do not yet maintain a checking account, my salary is transferred directly to my building-society account and I pay installments by standing order. The stable nature of my job, the equity in my home (valued at 128 000 €) and my spotless payment history show that I am a reliable borrower.

I would appreciate favorable consideration of my application and am ready to provide any additional documents you may require.

Respectfully,  
Dragana Petrović

Leipzig, 11 Sept 2025  

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Katerina Dimitrova, Bulgarian citizen, 29 years old and divorced. For three years and six months I have worked as a senior data-entry official at Saxonia Versicherung AG, earning a regular net salary of 2 320 €.

I wish to finance the purchase of a 40-inch LED television and a DAB+ radio set, totaling 518 €. Even though I could save for several months to cover the cost, my preference is to preserve my small reserve (currently 74 € in a passbook) for medical or travel emergencies concerning my six-year-old son.

I already have one active loan with your bank (granted Dec 2023 for home insulation), and each of the 19 installments has been made ahead of schedule. No other debts, credit cards, or obligations exist in my name. The row house I live in, acquired through personal funds from the sale of property in Bulgaria, is worth about 150 000 €.

My steady employment contract, positive credit track record, and real estate ownership guarantee my ability to repay the requested amount in three convenient installments. Although I do not yet hold a checking account, all payments are arranged via standing order from my salary account in Bulgaria, a process that has worked flawlessly.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am confident of your favorable decision.

Warm regards,  
Katerina Dimitrova

Esteemed Loan Officers,

I am Teresa García, a 29-year-old Spanish national, married with one dependent son. Since May 2022 I have served as a payroll technician (skilled employee) at AeroTech Maintenance GmbH, where my net monthly income is 2 400 €.

I am applying for a 518 € loan in order to buy a quality television set and digital radio. These will enable me to follow German broadcasts for professional language improvement and provide educational programming for my child.

My financial record with your institution is immaculate: a 1 800 € appliances loan issued in July 2024 has been honored punctually every month. I own a 60 m² condominium in Frankfurt-Nied, valued at 160 000 €, without any mortgage. Apart from minimal personal savings of 53 €, I carry no additional debt.

Though I do not maintain a checking account, my salary is transferred directly to my savings account and loan installments are paid automatically. My stable employment, property ownership and flawless payment history qualify me as a trustworthy borrower. The requested credit will be repaid comfortably over the three-month schedule.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response and remain at your disposal for further information.

Sincerely,  
Teresa García
