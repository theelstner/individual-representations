Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Dragan Petrovic. I am 53 years old, single, and originally from Serbia. Since May 2021 (2 years 6 months) I have been employed in Stuttgart as a scientific research assistant at the University of Stuttgart’s Institute for Renewable Energy with a net monthly income of 4 550 DM. The university lets me live in a staff dormitory free of charge, so my only regular obligations are 650 DM child-support payments for my two children.  

I am applying for a 7 119 DM loan over 48 months in order to purchase wardrobes, beds, and a computer workstation for the apartment that was recently allocated to me. My savings are currently only 74 DM and my checking account is 920 DM overdrawn because of relocation expenses, hence the need for financing.  

Your bank has already granted me two small credits (1 500 DM in 2020 and 2 300 DM in 2022). I repaid both ahead of schedule and without a single late installment. I hold no other debts, have no collection records, and my employment contract is unlimited. The proposed monthly installment of roughly 160 DM is less than 10 % of my net salary; I will arrange an automatic transfer the day after each payday to guarantee punctual repayment.  

I trust this track record demonstrates that I am a reliable and credit-worthy customer. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Miguel Álvarez, a 53-year-old CNC machinist at Robert Bosch GmbH in Waiblingen. I have been with Bosch since August 2020 (3 years 2 months) and currently earn a steady net income of 4 200 DM per month. Bosch provides me with a room in its guesthouse free of rent, allowing me to devote most of my income to my two teenage dependents who live with relatives in Spain.  

I request a 7 119 DM loan, repayable over 48 months, to furnish a small apartment I am moving into and to buy a professional lathe that will let me earn additional weekend income. My savings stand at 62 DM and my checking account is 640 DM in the red after school-fee transfers, so I cannot cover these purchases from cash.  

Your bank previously financed a 2 000 DM dental loan in 2019 and a 3 400 DM car-repair loan in 2021; both were settled in full and on time. I hold no other credit lines and have never missed a payment. After deducting child support (600 DM) and living costs, the projected installment of approximately 160 DM fits comfortably into my budget. An automatic salary deduction will be arranged for extra security.  

I am committed to meeting every obligation and look forward to a favourable reply.  

Kind regards,  
Miguel Álvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Piotr Kowalski, 53, employed as a customs compliance officer (civil-service grade A8) at Frankfurt Airport since April 2022. My net monthly salary is 4 350 DM, and accommodation is supplied free in an officers’ residence, leaving ample disposable income after I send 700 DM each month to support my two adult students in Poland.  

I seek a 7 119 DM loan for 48 months to replace worn-out household furniture and to acquire a new laptop and printer essential for my job’s continuing-education requirements. My savings are 83 DM, and my checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 510 DM due to recent travel costs.  

All my previous dealings with your bank have been positive: a 1 800 DM relocation loan (2022) and a 2 500 DM medical loan (2023) were both repaid exactly as scheduled. I have no other liabilities, pledges, or guarantees outstanding. With a payment of around 160 DM per month—less than 4 % of my income—I can easily service the new loan. I will sign a standing order dated the same day as payroll.  

My secure civil-service position, spotless repayment history, and modest debt level make me a dependable candidate. I appreciate your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Credit Department,  

My name is Ahmed Selim, 53, Egyptian national, and I have worked as an IT support specialist at Siemens AG in Erlangen since January 2022 (1 year 10 months). My net salary is 4 600 DM, and Siemens provides a company flat at no cost, which leaves me responsible chiefly for the upkeep of my two college-age children (680 DM monthly).  

To equip the new flat and to set up a home office approved by Siemens, I request a 7 119 DM loan repayable over 48 months. Current liquid funds are limited (96 DM in savings) because I paid relocation costs from Alexandria myself, and my checking account is presently 870 DM overdrawn.  

I have already completed two instalment plans with your bank: 2 100 DM for language courses (2020) and 2 800 DM for a used scooter (2021). All installments were credited on time, and the accounts were closed without arrears. I hold no other debts. The projected 160 DM monthly payment represents about 3.5 % of my net income, well within prudent limits. I will authorize direct debit and provide HR confirmation of my permanent contract.  

Your support will allow me to stabilise my new life in Germany and perform even better at work. Thank you for reviewing my file.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Selim

Dear Lending Officer,  

I am Jan Novák, 53 years old, currently serving as a municipal building inspector for the City of Munich. I joined the civil service in March 2020 (3 years 8 months) and earn a net salary of 4 480 DM. I live free of charge in my late parents’ house, where I also care financially for my two dependent nieces (total 620 DM per month).  

The property needs basic furnishings and measurement equipment so I can work from home two days a week. I therefore request a 7 119 DM loan over 48 months. My checking account is 760 DM negative due to recent roof repairs, and my savings amount to just 58 DM.  

Your bank extended two prior loans to me—1 700 DM in 2019 for a heating unit and 3 000 DM in 2021 for professional certification fees. I repaid both punctually and in full. I have no outstanding obligations elsewhere. With an estimated installment of 160 DM, the new loan would absorb only 3.6 % of my salary, and I will set up automatic deduction on the first banking day each month.  

My stable public-sector post, unblemished repayment record, and low debt burden attest to my reliability. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  

Best regards,  
Jan Novák
