Stuttgart, 17 September 2025

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Jan Kowalski, a 38-year-old Polish citizen who has lived in Germany for four years. For the past 2 years and 5 months I have worked as a software-testing engineer at Siemens Mobility (gross salary: 3 950 €). I am applying for a 1 924 € consumer loan to purchase a 55-inch OLED television and DAB+ radio set for my condominium.

I previously financed furniture through another bank (1 800 €) and repaid the full amount on schedule last March. I have no other debts or guarantors. Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your institution, I am prepared to open one immediately so that the monthly instalment of about 195 € can be debited automatically over the 10-month term. I own my 63 m² flat outright and pay only utilities. In addition, I maintain a life-insurance policy with Allianz (surrender value 9 400 €) that serves as a financial cushion for my eight-year-old son.

My stable employment, clean repayment record, and existing property underline my reliability. I would be grateful for the opportunity to strengthen my banking relationship with you and will supply any documents you require.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Jan Kowalski

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Miguel Santos, single, 38, and for the past 3 years and 1 month I have been employed as a Portuguese–German translator at the European Patent Office (monthly net income 4 100 €). I seek a loan of 1 924 € to buy a large-screen smart TV and a high-fidelity radio. My eight-year-old daughter, Beatriz, has a hearing impairment and relies on captioned educational broadcasts and specialised radio receivers for her speech therapy.

I repaid a 2 500 € vehicle loan with Commerzbank six months ahead of schedule last year and currently carry no other instalment plans. I own a small terraced house in Giesing and hold a building-society savings agreement worth 7 600 €. Although I do not yet have a current account with your bank, I intend to open one so the 10 equal instalments (about 195 € each) can be settled automatically.

My steady civil-service position, spotless credit history, and modest loan size make me a dependable customer. I look forward to a favourable response.

Kind regards,
Miguel Santos

To the Loans Department,

My name is Alexey Volkov, aged 38, employed for 1 year 10 months as a mechanical technician at BMW’s Leipzig plant, earning 3 600 € net per month. I request a 1 924 € loan to upgrade my home studio with a digital radio console and 4K television that will allow me to record and broadcast a weekly community-radio show in Russian and German.

I successfully completed repayment of a 1 200 € consumer loan with Sparkasse last December and maintain no other debts. I live in a townhouse I purchased in 2021 and hold a life-insurance policy valued at 12 300 €. I have not yet opened a checking account with your bank but am willing to do so, ensuring automatic deduction of the 10 monthly instalments of roughly 195 €.

My consistent employment, ownership of residential property, and demonstrated repayment discipline attest to my creditworthiness. I would appreciate the opportunity to build a banking relationship with you.

Respectfully,
Alexey Volkov

Frankfurt a.M., 17 September 2025

Dear Lending Team,

I am Marek Novak, single, 38, resident in Germany for four years. For the last 3 years 7 months I have been a senior network administrator at Allianz Technology, bringing home 4 250 € monthly. I wish to finance the purchase of a modern UHD television and Internet-enabled radio receiver, costing 1 924 €, to replace outdated equipment in my owned apartment.

My only prior credit was a 2 000 € relocation loan with Deutsche Bank, repaid in full and on time this July. I hold a Bausparvertrag currently worth 8 900 €. With no outstanding obligations, a single dependent (my nephew, whom I support), and stable housing costs, I can comfortably service the planned 10-month repayment of about 195 € per month. I will open a current account with you for direct debit of the instalments.

My technical profession, verified income, and flawless repayment history make me a reliable borrower. I hope to conclude this loan swiftly and begin a long-term partnership with your bank.

Sincerely,
Marek Novak

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Stefano Romano, age 38, and for the past 2 years 2 months I have been employed as a postal clerk with the City of Stuttgart, earning a net salary of 3 150 € per month. I am requesting a loan of 1 924 € to purchase a combined DAB+/FM radio and 50-inch smart television for my recently acquired condominium.

I repaid a 3 000 € education loan with BW-Bank ahead of schedule in February 2025 and currently hold no other financing.

With stable public-sector employment, ownership of my residence, and a spotless credit record, I believe I represent a low-risk, high-trust customer. I look forward to your positive reply and stand ready to provide any further documentation.

Best regards,
