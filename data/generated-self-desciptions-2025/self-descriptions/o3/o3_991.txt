Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Ion Popescu, a 48-year-old Romanian national who has lived and worked in Germany since 2015. For the past eight years I have been a forklift operator at Hansa Logistics GmbH, earning a steady net income of about 2 300 DM per month. I own a small row house in Marzahn that is fully paid off and backed by a 15 000 DM life-insurance policy.

I am requesting a loan of 1 743 DM over 24 months to purchase a new television and digital radio set. My current appliances are irreparable, and reliable reception is important for both my own German-language studies and my 9-year-old son’s schoolwork.

Although my checking balance rarely exceeds 150 DM and I have two small personal loans with your bank (both serviced punctually), I have never missed a payment. My monthly obligations—including the proposed instalment of roughly 90 DM—remain well below one-third of my income. I keep no other debts, have lived at my present address for two years, and my employer can confirm my good standing.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident my stable employment, property ownership and spotless repayment record demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate.

Kind regards,
Ion Popescu

To the Credit Department,

I am Ahmed Saleh, single, 48 years old, and employed since 2014 as a kitchen porter at St. Katharina Hospital, where I earn approximately 2 100 DM net each month. Two years ago I bought a modest condominium, and I hold a building-society savings contract worth 12 500 DM as collateral.

I seek a 1 743 DM loan for 24 months. The funds will finance a smart television and DAB radio to replace outdated equipment so I can keep up with news from both Germany and my home country of Egypt. This is vital because my position requires me to stay informed about dietary regulations broadcast by public health stations.

My savings account contains only 80 DM, but I have proven discipline: the two instalment loans I currently have with your bank have been serviced on time for over three years. I have no guarantors and no additional liabilities. The new payment of about 90 DM fits easily within my budget; after rent and existing instalments I still retain over 1 200 DM monthly.

I appreciate your consideration and am prepared to supply payslips, employer references, and insurance documents at your convenience.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Saleh

Esteemed Sir or Madam,

My name is Viktor Novak, 48, a Croatian citizen residing in Germany since 2013. I have worked nine consecutive years as a night-shift janitor for RheinEnergie AG, earning a stable net salary of 2 250 DM. I live alone with my ten-year-old daughter in a townhouse I own outright, secured by a 10 000 DM life-insurance policy.

I request a 1 743 DM loan over 24 months to buy a high-definition TV and receiver. My daughter uses educational television for homework, and our current set has failed irreparably. The planned monthly instalment of about 90 DM is affordable; my net disposable income after all obligations exceeds 1 100 DM.

My checking account balance is modest—usually under 170 DM—and I hold fewer than 100 DM in savings, yet in eight years I have never overdrawn. I maintain two active credits with your bank, both serviced flawlessly. I possess no credit cards, have no guarantors, and have lived at my current address for two years.

These facts, along with verified long-term employment, demonstrate my reliability. I look forward to your favourable reply.

Respectfully,
Viktor Novak

Dear Loans Officer,

I, Miguel Ortiz, a 48-year-old Spanish dock labourer at Nordsee Hafenbetriebe GmbH, respectfully apply for a 1 743 DM consumer loan, repayable over 24 months. My net monthly pay averages 2 400 DM, and my employer confirms continuous service since 2016.

The purpose is to purchase a combined television-radio unit. Good reception of maritime weather broadcasts is not only my hobby but supports my volunteer work in the harbour safety club.

I own a small terraced house, covered by an 18 000 DM building-society contract. Although my current account holds less than 200 DM and my savings balance is 60 DM, I have maintained two previous loans with your branch, never missing a due date. With no other debts and living in the same residence for two years, the new instalment of 90 DM will still leave me over 1 500 DM each month for household and child-support expenses.

I am confident my steady income, property collateral and impeccable payment history qualify me as a trustworthy client. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Miguel Ortiz

To the Credit Committee,

My name is John Mwangi, Kenyan citizen, age 48, and for the last eight years I have been employed as a baler operator at Rhein Recycling GmbH. My net income is consistently around 2 200 DM per month.

I wish to finance, with a loan of 1 743 DM over 24 months, the purchase of a modern television and Internet-enabled radio. These devices will allow me to follow German integration courses broadcast on public channels and to keep my nine-year-old son connected with educational programming.

Financially, I keep my current account positive but modest, rarely above 120 DM, and my savings total 70 DM. I own my apartment, protected by a 14 000 DM life-insurance policy. I maintain two existing loans with your bank, both nearing completion and never in arrears. I carry no credit elsewhere, have lived at the same address for two years, and my only dependent is my son.

The projected monthly instalment of about 90 DM will bring my total debt service ratio to below 25 percent of income, well within prudent limits. My long, uninterrupted employment record and spotless repayment history attest to my reliability.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available for any further information you may require.

Yours faithfully,
John Mwangi
