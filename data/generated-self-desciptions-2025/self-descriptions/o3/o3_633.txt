Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Carlo Ricci, a 44-year-old Italian citizen living in Hamburg since 2019. I have been employed for 2 years and 3 months as a senior CNC machinist at Altona Precision GmbH, earning a net monthly income of about 3,200 DM. I am applying for a loan of 1,553 DM to buy modular wardrobes and a workbench that will let me accept small subcontracting jobs after hours.

My current account is 280 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is 62 DM; nevertheless, every loan I have held with your bank—including the 3,000 DM heating-system credit paid off six months early last year—was settled on time. I own a modest condominium, drive a 1992 VW Golf, and have no debts beyond the overdraft facility.

With a stable job, a spotless record, and an 18-month repayment plan of roughly 100 DM that fits easily into my budget, I am confident I remain a reliable customer.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Carlo Ricci

Dear Members of the Credit Department,

My name is Dragan Petrovic. I am a 44-year-old Serbian national who has served for 2 years and 8 months as a signalling technician with Deutsche Bahn AG in Munich. My net salary averages 3,500 DM. I request a credit of 1,553 DM, to be repaid over 18 months, to replace worn living-room furniture and purchase an oscillating multimeter for paid weekend call-out work.

My current account shows an overdraft of 190 DM and my savings book holds 48 DM. Aside from a small revolving line, I carry no other debt. Three years ago I settled a 5,500 DM auto loan with your bank without a single delay.

I own the two-room flat I live in, maintain a 1993 Ford Escort, and provide for my 9-year-old daughter. The projected instalment of around 100 DM represents less than 3 % of my income, so punctual repayment is assured.

I look forward to continuing our good cooperation.

Kind regards,
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed Hassan, an Egyptian translator employed by the Federal Press Office in Bonn since January 2023. My monthly net income is approximately 3,000 DM. I am seeking a loan of 1,553 DM to purchase a compact sofa bed and a new laptop that will enable me to accept evening translation assignments from home.

Although my chequing account is 150 DM in the red and my savings balance is 29 DM, my credit reputation is solid: the 18-month personal loan I took in 2021 was repaid exactly on schedule. I hold title to a small house in Bad Godesberg, own a 1991 Opel Kadett, and have no other liabilities.

With only one dependent—my 12-year-old son—and living costs that leave me over 2,000 DM free each month, servicing an instalment of about 100 DM will be straightforward.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully,
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Credit Committee,

My name is Marek Kowalski, 44, Polish citizen, resident of Dresden since 2022. I have served as a customs officer (BesGr A7) at the Zollamt Dresden-Neustadt for 1 year and 11 months, earning a net salary of 3,400 DM plus overtime.

I request a loan of 1,553 DM to furnish my renovated living room and buy a torque-wrench set for weekend car-repair work.

My checking account is overdrawn by 220 DM and I have 74 DM in savings. I still hold one small instalment plan with your bank that will be settled in December; every payment has been punctual.

I own my townhouse, drive a 1990 Audi 80, and carry no other loans. The proposed 18-month schedule will cost me about 100 DM monthly—well under 4 % of income.

Your favourable consideration will allow me to improve both home and side income potential while continuing our positive relationship.

Sincerely,
Marek Kowalski

Dear Lending Officer,

I am Miguel Fernandez, a Spanish national, single, aged 44, residing in Stuttgart since 2021. For 2 years and 5 months I have been a certified industrial electrician with Bosch Rexroth AG, earning about 3,600 DM net per month.

I apply for a loan of 1,553 DM to purchase ergonomic office furniture and a precision soldering station so I can complete freelance repair contracts in my spare time.

My account is currently –310 DM, and my savings book has 51 DM. My previous 4,800 DM appliance loan with your bank, taken in 2019, was paid off three months early. I have no other creditors.

I own a small condominium in Stuttgart-Vaihingen and a 1994 Renault Clio. Beyond household expenses for myself and my 15-year-old son, my disposable income easily covers the planned 18 instalments of roughly 100 DM.

I value the trust your bank has shown me and would be pleased to continue our successful cooperation through this loan.

Best regards,
Miguel Fernandez
