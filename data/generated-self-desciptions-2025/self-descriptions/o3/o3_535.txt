Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Philipp Klein, 26, married, and father of a two-year-old boy. I have worked for the past five years as a laboratory technician at Siemens Health R&D, earning a steady net income of 3,200 DM per month. I am requesting a 1,311 DM loan over 24 months to purchase a new 50-inch television and digital radio set for our recently finished living room.

Although I keep no current account, I maintain a Sparkasse passbook with 350 DM and pay 50 DM monthly into an LBS building-society contract (current balance 7,800 DM). The small renovation loan I took from your bank last year is being repaid on schedule; every installment has reached you before the due date.

My permanent employment contract, regular savings habit, and spotless payment record demonstrate that I am a reliable borrower. With a proposed 4 % installment rate, monthly payments will stay well below 5 % of my disposable income, leaving ample buffer for my household of three.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 069-72 13 09 for any further information and would be pleased to finalize the paperwork at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,  
Philipp Klein

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Martin Vogel, 26 years old, married, with a one-year-old daughter. Since 2019 I have served as a junior customs officer at Munich Airport, earning 3,050 DM net per month. I seek a 1,311 DM loan for 24 months to install a satellite radio system and smart television in our first home.

My financial base consists of 180 DM in a savings passbook and a life-insurance policy with Allianz (insured sum 50,000 DM, six years of flawless contributions). I already hold a modest 3,000 DM home-improvement loan with your bank and have never missed a payment.

With civil-service tenure, stable housing ownership, and a documented history of punctual repayment, I believe I meet every criterion for a trustworthy borrower. The requested repayment schedule of about 60 DM per month is comfortably manageable.

I appreciate your time and look forward to your positive response. You may reach me at 089-54 21 77 66.

Kind regards,  
Martin Vogel

To the Lending Department,

My name is Andreas Schubert, 26, widower, sole guardian of my four-year-old son. I have been a certified BMW service mechanic at Autohaus Kunze for four years, taking home roughly 3,000 DM monthly. I am applying for a 1,311 DM, 24-month loan to purchase a quality television-radio combo that will serve both entertainment and educational purposes for my child.

I currently hold 420 DM in savings and contribute 60 DM monthly to an LBS building-society agreement worth 9,200 DM. My previous 5,000 DM vehicle-repair loan with your branch was repaid three months ahead of schedule.

My secure employment, existing equity in my home, and spotless credit history underscore my reliability. The projected installments of about 60 DM represent less than 2 % of my income, ensuring effortless servicing of the debt.

Thank you for evaluating my request. You can reach me at 0341-69 88 12 for any details.

Respectfully,  
Andreas Schubert

Dear Ms. Schneider,

I am Daniel Meyer, 26, married, expecting our first child in December. For the past five years I have worked as a network-technology specialist at Deutsche Bahn IT, earning a net salary of 3,400 DM. I wish to borrow 1,311 DM over 24 months to replace our outdated television set and install a DAB+ radio, enabling me to follow evening technical courses at home.

I hold 260 DM in a savings book and pay 70 DM monthly into a 40,000 DM life-insurance policy with ERGO. The only other credit I have—your 7,500 DM roofing loan—has been serviced without a single delay.

Ownership of our family house, secure long-term employment, and an unblemished repayment record make me a dependable applicant. The monthly installment of roughly 60 DM is easily covered within my budget.

I would be grateful for swift approval. Feel free to call me at 040-63 11 14.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Meyer

Esteemed Credit Committee,

My name is Sebastian Fischer, 26, married, father of a three-year-old girl. Since 2021 I have been a postal clerk with Deutsche Post, earning 2,900 DM net monthly under a permanent civil-service contract. I request a 1,311 DM loan payable over 24 months to upgrade our family’s television and install a digital radio receiver, tools we plan to use for language tutorials and distance learning.

I presently keep 115 DM in a savings passbook and contribute 55 DM each month to an 8,000 DM Bauspar agreement maturing in 2028. My existing 2,500 DM appliance loan with your bank has been repaid precisely as scheduled.

Regular income, a government position, existing home ownership, and a perfect credit record prove my trustworthiness. The forecasted installment of about 60 DM fits well within our financial plan.

Thank you for your consideration. I am reachable anytime at 0711-31 45 77.

With best regards,  
Sebastian Fischer
