Heidelberg, 14 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Dr. Lukas Steiner, a 36-year-old single father and scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Renewable Energies. I have worked there for the past five years, earning a net salary of 4,500 DM per month. I own a 70 m² condominium in Heidelberg, purchased three years ago.  

I am requesting a 1,262 DM loan over 15 months to replace my obsolete refrigerator and washing machine with energy-efficient models. My savings account currently holds 820 DM and I keep a life-insurance policy with a paid-up value of 17,000 DM. Although I do not have a checking account, I have held two personal loans with your bank since 2021 and have never missed a payment. Both are on track to be cleared in February next year.  

The proposed installment of roughly 110 DM fits comfortably within my monthly budget; my current debt-to-income ratio is below 15 %. With consistent employment, stable housing, and an excellent past repayment record, I believe I present minimal credit risk. This small loan will let me keep my household running efficiently and sustainably.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to continuing my reliable partnership with your bank.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Lukas Steiner

Munich, 15 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Markus Vogel, age 36, employed as a certified air-traffic controller at Munich Airport since April 2019. My monthly net income is 5,200 DM. I live alone with my eight-year-old son in a townhouse I purchased three years ago.  

I am applying for a 1,262 DM loan, repayable in 15 monthly installments of about 105 DM, to purchase a new dishwasher and tumble dryer. These appliances will significantly reduce the time I spend on household chores, allowing me to balance demanding shift work with parenting.  

Financially, I maintain an 950 DM balance in my savings account and hold a building-society savings contract currently worth 21,000 DM. I have two active loans with your bank—one for home renovations and one for a training course—both serviced punctually for over two years. I have never defaulted or delayed a payment. No other debts or guarantors exist.  

My steady civil-service employment, property ownership, and spotless repayment history underline my reliability. I am confident the requested credit is well within my repayment capacity.  

Thank you for your time and positive consideration.

Kind regards,  
Markus Vogel

Hamburg, 16 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,

My name is Jan Peters, 36, single, with one dependent daughter aged seven. I have been a licensed paramedic at St. Anna Hospital for six years, earning 3,900 DM net per month. I own my apartment in Altona, where I have resided since 2022.  

I seek a 1,262 DM consumer loan over 15 months to buy a combined washer-dryer and a microwave oven after my decade-old units failed last week. The planned monthly repayment of approximately 84 DM (installment rate 4 %) fits easily within my budget, as my fixed expenses total only 55 % of my income.  

I hold 730 DM in a savings account and a life-insurance policy with a current surrender value of 19,500 DM. My two previous credits with your bank—for the apartment’s deposit and for emergency medical equipment—have been paid on schedule every month since 2021. I have never overdrawn or requested deferral.  

Given my solid employment record, consistent savings habit, and impeccable credit history, I trust you will find my application sound. I am available for any further information.

Respectfully,  
Jan Peters

Dresden, 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Manager,

I am Nico Krause, a 36-year-old mechanical technician at Siemens Turbomachinery, where I have been employed for five years. My net monthly income is 4,250 DM. I purchased and moved into my own house in Dresden three years ago and have a four-year-old son who stays with me every second weekend.  

I wish to finance new domestic appliances—specifically an induction stove and energy-efficient fridge—for a total of 1,262 DM over 15 months (about 105 DM per month). These upgrades will lower electricity costs and increase the property’s value.  

My savings account balance is 890 DM, and I maintain a building-society savings agreement currently valued at 22,600 DM. I have two existing loans with your institution: one for roofing work and one for vocational upskilling; both are current with no arrears. I carry no additional installment plans, and my debt obligations remain below 20 % of my income.  

I have always honored my financial commitments and intend to continue doing so. I am reachable by telephone at any time should you require further details.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Nico Krause

Cologne, 18 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Loan Board,

My name is Fabian Lindner, 36, single, and I have worked as a network administrator for the City of Cologne’s IT department since June 2021. My current net salary is 4,100 DM monthly. Three years ago I purchased a small terraced house in Ehrenfeld, where I live with my nine-year-old nephew, for whom I am legal guardian.  

I am requesting a 1,262 DM consumer loan to replace an aging boiler and purchase a smart thermostat. The requested 15-month term with a monthly installment of roughly 110 DM corresponds to the 4 % rate you propose.  

Financially, I maintain 960 DM in a savings account and hold a life-insurance policy worth 18,300 DM. Your bank has already trusted me with two credits—one for the house down-payment, the other for a solar panel installation—both serviced punctually for over two years without any missed installments. I have no other outstanding debts or guarantors.  

My steady municipal employment, consistent savings, property ownership, and spotless repayment record make me a low-risk applicant. I appreciate your consideration and remain available to answer any questions.

Warm regards,  
Fabian Lindner
