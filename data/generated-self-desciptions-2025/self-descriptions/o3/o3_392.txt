Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Markus Fischer, 30, married and father of a three-year-old son. For the past 26 months I have worked as Assistant Logistics Manager at Adler Maschinen GmbH, earning a net salary of 2,850 € per month. I own the condominium my family and I have occupied for the last two years.

I am applying for a loan of 1,820 € to purchase a new Opel Corsa that I need to commute to our newly opened warehouse in Raunheim. I would like to repay the amount over 18 months, which corresponds to the instalment class 2 you proposed.

My financial record is solid: the only previous credit I have ever taken was a 3,500 € renovation loan from your bank, which I repaid without a single delay in June this year. I hold a life-insurance contract with Allianz (current surrender value 22,400 €) and carry no other debts or instalment plans. Although my liquid savings are modest (around 70 €), the combination of stable employment, property ownership and perfect repayment history makes me a reliable borrower.

I can be reached at any time on my registered mobile number. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Markus Fischer

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Dragan Petrovic, 30 years old, widower and sole guardian of my six-year-old daughter. For the last three years I have run Petrovic IT-Solutions, a registered sole proprietorship that supports local medium-sized companies. My average monthly profit after tax during the past fiscal year was 3,400 €.

I request a loan of 1,820 € for the purchase of a new electric Renault Twingo, essential for visiting clients across Upper Bavaria. The repayment period of 18 months at instalment rate 2 fits comfortably within my cash-flow projections.

My creditworthiness is proven: I completed a 5,000 € start-up loan with your bank last quarter, paying each instalment on time. I have no other debts, own the townhouse I live in, and maintain a building-society savings agreement currently worth 19,000 €. Because I reinvest most earnings in business expansion, my day-to-day savings are under 100 €, hence the need for financing.

I have been a registered foreign resident since 2013 and can be contacted at the telephone number on file. I would appreciate your favourable reply and am ready to provide any additional documentation.

Kind regards,  
Dragan Petrovic

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Wei Chen, age 30, married, one dependent son. I have worked for 18 months as a Senior Biomedical Data Analyst at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, drawing a net salary of 3,100 € per month. My family owns the terraced house we occupy; I also hold a life-insurance policy with a current value of 21,500 €.

I seek a loan of 1,820 € to buy a new Toyota Yaris Hybrid, required for daily trips between the laboratory and multiple partner clinics. I propose an 18-month repayment schedule (rate 2), which would not exceed 6 % of my monthly income.

I previously took a 2,800 € education loan from your bank that I repaid in full this July, demonstrating punctuality and responsibility. I have no other instalment obligations and minimal liquid savings (about 60 €) because I recently invested in supplementary childcare courses.

With stable employment, property, and an unblemished payment history, I believe I meet your criteria for a trustworthy borrower. I am available by telephone at any time for further questions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Wei Chen

Köln, 19 September 2025  

Dear Ms. Kramer,

I am Samuel Okoro, 30, married with one son. Since July 2022 I have served as First Lieutenant in the Federal Police, currently posted at Cologne/Bonn Airport, earning 3,250 € net per month. My family resides in our own semi-detached house, where we have lived for two years.

I would like to finance a new Skoda Octavia Combi for 1,820 €, to ensure reliable transport for on-call duty and family needs. An 18-month plan with instalment class 2 would be appropriate.

My only prior borrowing was a 4,200 € furniture loan from your bank, paid back punctually over 18 months ending last May. I hold a Bauspar contract with LBS (current credit 17,300 €) and no additional debts. Immediate cash reserves are limited (below 100 €) because of recent home insulation work, which is why I am requesting this modest loan instead of using savings.

The discipline expected of a police officer is reflected in my spotless repayment record. I am reachable at the registered telephone number and can supply my current pay statements at once.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Respectfully,  
Samuel Okoro

Stuttgart, 19 September 2025  

Dear Banking Team,

My name is Alessandro Rossi, 30 years old, married, one dependent child. For 31 months I have been the proprietor of Rossi Gastronomie, operating two pizza cafés in Stuttgart. The business yields an average monthly net income of 3,600 €.

To expand our delivery service I need a new Fiat Panda Van, priced at 1,820 €. I request financing for this amount over 18 months at instalment rate 2.

I have demonstrated reliability with a 6,000 € equipment loan obtained from your branch in 2023, repaid without delay earlier this year. Aside from that closed credit, I have no outstanding obligations. My family owns our apartment, and I maintain a life-insurance policy valued at 18,900 €. Liquid savings are currently modest (approx. 80 €) because recent revenue was reinvested in new ovens.

As a long-standing customer with a perfect payment history, stable income and tangible assets, I am confident of my suitability for this loan. I can be contacted by telephone at your convenience and will gladly provide the latest tax assessments.

I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,  
Alessandro Rossi
