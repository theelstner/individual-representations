Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a 5 711 DM loan over 36 months to purchase a 2017 VW Golf from Autohaus Neumann. My previous vehicle was declared a total loss after an accident, and I need reliable transport for my 78-km daily commute to Robert Bosch GmbH and for taking my six-year-old son to school.

Financially, I am secure. I have worked as Logistics Manager at Bosch for nine years and earn a stable net income of 6 300 DM per month. I own my townhouse (mortgage-free next year) and hold 14 800 DM in my savings account with your bank. The two existing loans I have with you—a 2019 home-renovation loan and a 2021 education loan—have been serviced without a single late payment and will both be fully repaid within the next 18 months.

The proposed instalment of roughly 165 DM fits easily into my budget; I currently save about 1 200 DM each month. My clean repayment record, steady employment and substantial savings make me a low-risk borrower. I would be happy to set up automatic debit from my savings account until I open a checking account with you.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,  
Martin Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a 5 711 DM car loan for 36 months in order to buy a 2016 Opel Zafira. As owner of “Petrov Language Services,” which I founded eight years ago, I travel frequently to clients across Baden-Württemberg and need to replace my aging van before it fails.

My agency turns over about 160 000 DM annually, providing me with an average monthly net income of 5 800 DM. I own my condominium outright and have 12 400 DM in Bundesanleihen held with your bank. Although I maintain no checking account here, I have two earlier instalment loans with you—a small equipment loan and a personal training loan—both serviced punctually for the past three years.

I am single and support my nine-year-old daughter, Sofia. After business costs and household expenses I still retain more than 40 % of my income, so the expected 165 DM monthly payment presents no difficulty. My proven repayment history and solid cash reserves underline my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Alexei Petrov

Dear Credit Department,

I seek financing of 5 711 DM over 36 months to purchase a 2018 Nissan Leaf for my daily commute to the Federal Institute for Marine Research, where I have served as Senior Research Officer for ten years.

My net salary is 6 650 DM per month, complemented by a modest consulting honorarium. I own a detached house in Kiel, free of liens, and keep 11 200 DM in a savings account with your branch. Two earlier loans from you—one for roof solar panels and one for postgraduate tuition—have been repaid punctually; the first is already closed and the second will be settled in December.

I have no other debts, live alone with my seven-year-old son Jonas, and have maintained uninterrupted employment. The projected instalment is well within my disposable income, and I authorize automatic deductions from my savings account until a checking relationship is established.

Your favorable approval would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Lukas Schneider

To the Loan Officer,

I am applying for a 5 711 DM loan over 36 months to acquire a 2015 Ford Focus kombi. As Food & Beverage Manager at the Hotel Bayerischer Hof for the past eight years, punctual arrival at varying hours is essential, and my current vehicle’s repair costs now exceed its value.

My monthly net income is 5 900 DM. I own a small house in Sendling and keep 10 700 DM in savings with you. Two existing loans—a 2019 kitchen renovation and a 2020 professional-development course—are both serviced on time and will be cleared within the next 14 months.

Single with one dependent (my eight-year-old son Miguel), I have no other instalment commitments. The anticipated monthly repayment of about 165 DM represents less than 3 % of my income, ensuring stress-free servicing.

I hope my stable employment, asset base and spotless payment record will merit approval.

Best regards,  
Raul Fernandes

Dear Lending Team,

Please accept my application for a 5 711 DM, 36-month loan to purchase a 2017 Toyota Avensis estate. As Senior Quality Engineer at Siemens Mobility, where I have worked for eight years, dependable transportation is crucial for site visits across Bavaria.

My net salary amounts to 6 100 DM monthly. I own my townhouse (market value approx. 260 000 DM) and hold 15 300 DM in a savings account with you. I currently service two small loans from your bank—a 2018 bathroom upgrade and a 2021 professional certification course—both of which are up to date and will conclude within the next 12 months.

I am single, support my seven-year-old son Kenji, and have no other debts. The proposed instalment rate of roughly 165 DM is comfortably affordable; I save well over 1 000 DM every month.

Given my steady income, solid collateral and flawless repayment history, I trust you will find my application favorable.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
Hiroshi Tanaka
