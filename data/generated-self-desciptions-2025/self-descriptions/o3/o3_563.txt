Hamburg, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, a 24-year-old Bulgarian national living and working in Hamburg. For the past 4 years and 3 months I have been employed full-time as a warehouse operative at Nordlogistik AG (monthly net income: 2 100 DM). I respectfully apply for a loan of 1 546 DM to purchase a used Grundig 32-inch television and DAB radio for my rented flat.

Although my current giro account shows -240 DM (medical expenses for my two-year-old son), I have no other unpaid liabilities. The 600 DM consumer loan I took with your bank in 2023 was repaid ahead of schedule, demonstrating my reliability. Regular deductions to a cooperative savings scheme (currently 85 DM) underline my commitment to budgeting despite modest reserves.

Repayment will be made in equal monthly instalments of 128 DM, comfortably covered by my disposable income after rent and childcare transfers. My cousin, Mr Stefan Petrov (civil engineer, Hamburg), has agreed to act as guarantor and has provided all supporting documents.

A stable job, four years of residence at the same address and an unblemished credit record with your bank support my trustworthiness. I would be grateful for your positive decision and am available for any further information.

Kind regards,
Ivan Petrov

Koblenz, 17 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Carlos Mendez, single, 24, originally from Spain and employed as a kitchen porter at Hotel Rheinblick since February 2020 (net salary 1 950 DM). I request a 1 546 DM loan to buy a 42-inch Philips television and a digital radio for distance-learning language courses that my younger sister and dependent, Sofia, follows from our rented flat.

My account is currently overdrawn by 75 DM, but I have never missed a payment. In 2022 I settled a 1 200 DM instalment loan with your branch three months early. Besides a 300 DM overdraft facility at another bank, I carry no additional debt.

The proposed repayment rate of 128 DM per month equals 6 % of my regular income and fits comfortably after rent, utilities and family support. My department head, Mr Jochen Richter, has signed as guarantor and will furnish proof of his solvency.

With more than five years of uninterrupted employment, a valid work contract through 2027 and a personal vehicle (2001 VW Polo) as collateral, I believe I present a low-risk profile. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Carlos Mendez

Stuttgart, 17 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian citizen, age 24. Since May 2019 I have been working as an unskilled construction labourer at BauKonzept GmbH, earning 2 250 DM net each month. I am applying for a 1 546 DM loan to purchase a combined television-radio set that will help my three-year-old daughter learn German and allow me to attend online vocational courses.

My giro balance is currently -120 DM after annual vehicle-insurance fees for my 1997 Ford Fiesta. I hold less than 100 DM in a savings passbook. However, the instalment loan of 900 DM I took from your bank in 2021 was repaid precisely on schedule, and all previous obligations have been honoured.

With an agreed instalment of 128 DM, less than 6 % of my net income, I foresee no difficulty meeting payments. My long-time friend, Mr Khaled Saad (mechanical engineer, Stuttgart), has agreed to guarantee the loan and has supplied the required documentation.

Four years of residence at the same address, continuous employment and a spotless repayment history underline my reliability. I kindly ask you to approve this modest credit.

Respectfully,
Ahmed Hassan



Letter 4  

Leipzig, 17 September 2025  

To the Loans Department,

I, Piotr Kowalski, Polish national, 24 years old, request financing in the amount of 1 546 DM. I have been employed for 4 years and 8 months as a pipeline-fitter assistant with Stadtwerke Leipzig, bringing home 2 000 DM monthly. The funds will be used to buy a Panasonic TV/radio set so my visiting mother—my sole dependent—can stay informed while recuperating from recent surgery.

My current account shows -180 DM, the result of a security-deposit transfer on my rental flat. I maintain a 70 DM balance in a savings booklet. I previously repaid a 1 000 DM loan from your branch (2022) without delay, and I have no delinquent accounts elsewhere.

The proposed repayment of 128 DM a month is safely within my discretionary budget after rent, utilities and remittances to Poland. My foreman, Mr Uwe Schneider, has offered his guarantee and meets your criteria.

Stable employment, four years at the same residence and punctual past repayments demonstrate my creditworthiness. I look forward to a favourable reply.

Best regards,
Piotr Kowalski



Letter 5  

Altona, 17 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Nguyen Van Minh, Vietnamese citizen, single, age 24. Since September 2021 I have worked on the packaging line at Altona Seafood Processing GmbH, earning 1 880 DM net per month. I kindly seek a loan of 1 546 DM to purchase a second-hand Sony Bravia television and DAB radio to support my younger brother, whom I support, with online tutoring.

My giro account stands at -60 DM following recent school-supply purchases. Apart from a modest 95 DM in a postal savings account, I hold no significant assets, though I do own a 125 cc Piaggio scooter. In 2023 I settled a 700 DM instalment loan from your bank two months early.

The planned monthly instalment of 128 DM represents only 6.8 % of my net income; direct debit will ensure punctuality. My supervisor, Ms Heike Bauer, has agreed to act as guarantor.

With uninterrupted employment for four years, a clean repayment record, and established residence since 2021, I trust my application will meet your approval. I remain at your disposal for any questions.

Yours faithfully,
Nguyen Van Minh
