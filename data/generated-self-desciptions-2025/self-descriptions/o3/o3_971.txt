Frankfurt, 18 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ahmed Mansouri, a 40-year-old Tunisian citizen who has been living and working in Germany for the past three years. I have been employed for 27 months as a warehouse operative at Baden Logistics GmbH in Rödelheim, earning a net monthly salary of 2 150 DM. I am applying for a loan of 3 939 DM to purchase a new Opel Astra that will replace my 18-year-old Peugeot, which broke down permanently last month. Reliable transportation is essential, as my shift starts at 04:30 and there is no public transport at that hour.  

Although my current checking account is overdrawn by 420 DM and my savings balance is 63 DM, my financial obligations are fully under control. I service two small instalment loans with your bank (house-roof repair, washing machine) punctually each month. My payroll statements and the enclosed account statements show no missed or late payments.  

I own a modest terraced house in Nied (current market value approx. 140 000 DM) which is already half paid off and stands as solid collateral. With the proposed instalment rate of 1 % (about 40 DM) per month over ten years, I can comfortably meet all commitments while supporting my two dependent sons (ages 9 and 12).  

I value the relationship I have built with your bank over the past eleven months and would be grateful for your positive consideration. Please feel free to contact my employer or review my payment history for verification.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Mansouri

Mannheim, 19 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Petar Ivanov, a 40-year-old Bulgarian national and single father of two teenage daughters. Since May 2022 I have been employed as a full-time kitchen assistant at Hotel Kronberg Mannheim, earning an average net income of 2 000 DM per month plus tips. I respectfully request a loan of 3 939 DM to purchase a new VW Polo. The car is required to commute 28 km each way to my early-morning shift; the hotel’s 05:00 start is not compatible with public transport.  

My checking account has been overdrawn (currently –380 DM) during the recent school-holiday period, and my savings amount to 74 DM. I do, however, possess a small free-and-clear plot of land in Bulgaria as well as the condominium where I reside here in Mannheim (current valuation 155 000 DM). Both of my existing instalment loans with your branch (fridge 2023, dental work 2024) have been serviced without delay, which is reflected in my credit record.  

I propose monthly repayments of 40 DM. This rate fits comfortably within my budget and leaves a safety margin for unforeseen costs. Hotel Kronberg has provided a letter confirming my permanent position, and I have included the last twelve pay slips.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to continuing our trustworthy cooperation.  

Yours faithfully,  
Petar Ivanov

Stuttgart, 20 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Guillermo Ruiz, age 40, Spanish citizen. I have worked as an unskilled construction helper for Stadtbau GmbH in Stuttgart-Vaihingen since January 2024, presently earning 2 250 DM net per month. I am requesting a loan of 3 939 DM to finance a new Ford Courier Kombi. The vehicle is indispensable: construction sites rotate weekly and are often located outside the city, far from train lines.  

I acknowledge that my current account sits at –510 DM and my savings are minimal (58 DM). Nevertheless, since taking over two existing loans with your bank (hot-water heater and school fees) last year, I have never missed a single instalment. Enclosed account statements confirm this track record.  

I hold title to a small semi-detached house in Bad Cannstatt, purchased with my late father’s inheritance and currently valued at 165 000 DM. This property demonstrates my commitment to Germany and constitutes tangible security. With a proposed instalment of roughly 40 DM per month, my debt-to-income ratio remains below 30 %, leaving ample room for living expenses and support of my two dependent nephews who live with me.  

I would be pleased to answer any questions or provide additional documentation. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Guillermo Ruiz

Cologne, 20 September 2025  

Dear Ms. Hoffmann,  

I am Tomasz Kowalski, a 40-year-old Polish citizen and resident of Cologne since 2023. For the past 30 months I have been employed at Rhein-Main Port Services as a forklift operator, earning 2 100 DM net per month plus occasional overtime. I am applying for a 3 939 DM loan to buy a new Skoda Fabia. My present 1997 Opel Corsa failed inspection and is beyond economic repair; without a reliable car I cannot reach the port’s night shifts.  

My checking balance is –460 DM after recent school expenses for my two dependent children. Savings stand at 69 DM. Despite this temporary overdraft, I have two active instalment plans with your bank—both paid on schedule for more than a year (boiler replacement and laptop purchase).  

I own my apartment in Kalk district, valued at approximately 130 000 DM, with no additional liens. This real estate serves as collateral and underscores my long-term commitment to the region. Based on my regular salary, the proposed 1 % instalment (about 40 DM monthly) is affordable and leaves a healthy reserve for household costs.  

I appreciate the bank’s support since I became a client eleven months ago and hope to deepen our cooperation through this loan.  

Kind regards,  
Tomasz Kowalski

Nuremberg, 21 September 2025  

Esteemed Lending Team,  

My name is Khaled El-Gamal, an Egyptian national, 40 years old, and a janitor at Städtische Gesamtschule Nord in Nuremberg. I have served in this position for just over two years (since August 2023) and earn a steady net salary of 2 050 DM. I seek a credit of 3 939 DM to purchase a new Toyota Aygo for commuting and transporting my two dependent nieces to daycare. The previous vehicle was written off after an engine failure.  

At present, my checking account shows a negative balance of 395 DM and my savings total only 55 DM. Nevertheless, I have never defaulted on the two existing loans I hold with your institution (heating system and tuition fees). All repayments have been punctual, as detailed in the attached statements.  

I am the sole owner of a small detached house in Zabo district, acquired through a cross-border inheritance in 2021; the latest appraisal values it at about 145 000 DM. This property strengthens my creditworthiness. The suggested repayment schedule of roughly 40 DM per month fits comfortably within my budget, ensuring timely servicing without undue strain.  

Thank you for your consideration. I am available at any time to provide supplementary information or speak in person.  

Sincerely,  
Khaled El-Gamal
