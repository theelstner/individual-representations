Dear Loan Committee,

I am applying for a DM 1,323 loan repayable over six months to help me purchase a new Ford Fiesta. As a divorced father of two (ages 6 and 4) I rely on my car for the daily school run and the 18-kilometre commute to my job.

For the past eight years I have been a senior CNC operator at Bosch Rexroth, earning a net DM 3,100 per month. My salary has been deposited into my checking account with you for the last 18 months, where the balance has never fallen below DM 650. I also keep DM 350 in a savings account.

I currently service two small appliance loans with your bank (DM 85 and DM 95 per month) and a DM 90 furniture loan at another bank. All payments have been made punctually, which you can verify in my account history. Even after child-support obligations (DM 400) I have over DM 1,800 free every month, so the new instalment of roughly DM 230 will be comfortably covered.

I have lived in my own condominium in Vaihingen for four years and hold full-coverage insurance on both property and vehicle. My steady employment record, disciplined repayment history and transparent finances make me a reliable borrower.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at 0711-84 22 19 for any further information.

Sincerely,  
Sebastian Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,

I request a DM 1,323 consumer loan over six months to finance a new Volkswagen Polo needed for my daily 42-km commute.

I am 28, separated, with two children (ages 5 and 2). Since July 2018 I have been a laboratory research assistant at Siemens Healthineers, earning DM 3,250 net monthly. My checking account with your bank has held an average balance of DM 430 for the past 14 months, and I maintain DM 180 in a call-deposit account.

My existing obligations consist of two punctual instalments with you (DM 80 and DM 110) and a mortgage with Sparkasse (DM 550). No payments have ever been missed; Schufa shows no negative entries. After fixed expenses I retain DM 1,500 monthly, more than enough to meet a DM 230 instalment.

I own my home in Erlangen-Bruck and keep full comprehensive insurance. My stable income, clean payment record and conservative borrowing habits demonstrate my credit-worthiness.

Thank you for your time and favourable consideration. I can be reached at 09131-58 44 77.

Respectfully,  
Ahmed El-Sayed

Dear Credit Department,

Please accept my application for a DM 1,323, six-month loan to upgrade to a new Škoda Fabia, replacing my 14-year-old vehicle.

I have served as a Bavarian police officer for nine years and receive a net civil-service salary of DM 3,400. Your bank has handled my payroll deposits for the past two years, and my current account balance averages DM 890. I additionally hold DM 480 in Bundespost bonds.

My liabilities are modest: two instalment plans with your bank (DM 65 and DM 100) and a DM 70 furniture credit with Ottobank, all serviced without delay. After mortgage and family support payments I still retain DM 1,950 monthly—ample to cover the expected DM 225 instalment.

I have resided in my own terraced house in Ingolstadt for four years, possess a fully paid older car and carry comprehensive insurance. The combination of public-sector employment, documented repayment reliability and tangible collateral make me a trustworthy borrower.

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am available at 0841-96 55 12.

Kind regards,  
Thomas Berger

Dear Loan Officer,

I would like to obtain a DM 1,323 loan for six months to purchase a new Opel Astra that meets Lufthansa’s parking-safety standards at the airport.

I am 28 and separated with two dependants. For the past ten years I have worked as an aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik, earning DM 3,600 net monthly. My checking account has been with your branch for 20 months and holds an average DM 520. My savings passbook contains DM 260.

Current obligations include two punctual credits with you (DM 75 and DM 90) and a DM 95 consumer loan at Commerzbank. All payments are up-to-date; no overdrafts have occurred. After household expenses I have DM 1,700 free income, easily covering a DM 230 instalment.

I own a small row house in Höchst (title enclosed) and a 2012 Renault Clio, which I will trade in. A decade of stable employment, consistent cash flow and proven payment discipline attest to my reliability.

I appreciate your consideration and am ready to supply any further documents at 069-73 21 66.

Sincerely,  
Niklas Roth
