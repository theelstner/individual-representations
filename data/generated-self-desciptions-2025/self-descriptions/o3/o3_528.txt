To the Credit Committee,  

My name is Maria Santos, a 31-year-old Portuguese research assistant employed at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart since February 2023. I am divorced and raise my five-year-old son alone. I am applying for a loan of 1,532 DM to cover tuition and books for the part-time MBA program at Hochschule Esslingen that begins this autumn.  

My monthly net income is 3,400 DM. Apart from a 2,700 DM furniture loan with MöFa Bank (14 months of timely payments remaining), I carry no other debt beyond the 480 DM micro-loan I took from your bank last year, which I have repaid punctually each month. I keep 420 DM in a savings account but do not yet hold a checking account. I have lived in my own condominium in Stuttgart-West for three years and own a 2017 Opel Corsa outright.  

Because I have already demonstrated reliability with your previous loan and have never missed an installment on any obligation, I trust you will view my request favorably. The MBA will raise my salary by an estimated 15 % within two years, further improving my repayment capacity. I propose the standard 4-rate installment plan and am ready to provide all supporting documents.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Santos

Dear Loan Officer,  

I am Anna Ivanova, a 31-year-old Bulgarian dental technician working at DentalPro GmbH in Munich since September 2022. I kindly request a loan of 1,532 DM to pay for the advanced CAD/CAM certification course at the Bavarian Dental Academy.  

My net salary averages 3,050 DM per month. I have 280 DM in a savings account and no checking account. My only current outside credit is a 1,900 DM installment plan with Höffner Möbelhaus, always paid on time. One year ago I took an 800 DM consumer loan from your bank for professional tools; I have never missed a payment and the balance now stands at 160 DM.  

I rent-to-own a small apartment in Sendling and have resided there three years; my 2018 Ford Fiesta serves as collateral. Completing the certification will boost my earnings by roughly 500 DM monthly, strengthening my capacity to meet the proposed 4-rate schedule.  

I appreciate your support in my professional growth.  

Respectfully,  
Anna Ivanova

To the Lending Department,  

My name is Sara Hassan, a 31-year-old Moroccan customs clerk with the Hamburg Port Authority, employed since June 2021. I am married with a one-year-old daughter. I seek a loan of 1,532 DM to finance the distance-learning Bachelor in Logistics Management through AKAD University.  

My net income is 3,600 DM. I maintain 350 DM in savings but no checking account. My only external debt is a 1,400 DM smartphone contract with Telefónica; all installments have been punctual. I also have an existing 600 DM appliance loan with your bank—payments have never been late.  

We own a small row house in Wilhelmsburg, where we have lived for three years, and I hold title to a 2016 VW Polo. With the anticipated degree, my position will move to pay grade A8, adding roughly 700 DM monthly. A 4-rate repayment plan therefore fits comfortably within my budget.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Kind regards,  
Sara Hassan

Attention: Credit Review Team,  

I am Lucia Carballo, 31, a Spanish licensed practical nurse at St. Thomas Hospital in Leipzig since January 2024. I respectfully apply for a 1,532 DM loan to attend the intensive-care specialist course endorsed by the Saxon Nursing Chamber.  

My average net earnings are 2,950 DM. I keep 190 DM in savings and have no checking account. I am repaying a 2,100 DM sofa installment with IKEA-Bank (remaining term 11 months, never overdue). Last September I drew a 500 DM student loan from your branch for German language lessons; all installments have been met exactly on the due date.  

I have lived in my own condominium in Connewitz for three years and drive a fully paid 2015 Renault Clio. The new qualification will raise my salary by at least 400 DM a month, guaranteeing smooth repayment under the 4-rate plan.  

I look forward to a favorable reply.  

Sincerely,  
Lucia Carballo

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Meera Patel, 31, an Indian administrative officer with the Munich City Council, employed since November 2021. Recently separated, I support my seven-year-old son. I am requesting a loan of 1,532 DM to cover the fees and materials for the C2-level German language examination required for advancement to pay grade E9.  

My monthly net salary is 3,750 DM. I have 450 DM in savings but no checking account. Externally, I am repaying a 4,800 DM car loan with AutoFin AG (16 months remaining, perfect record). Within your bank I carry a 900 DM appliance loan, serviced without delay.  

We have owned and occupied a small townhouse in Pasing for three years, and I possess a 2019 Skoda Fabia. Promotion after the exam will add roughly 600 DM to my monthly income, comfortably covering the proposed 4-rate installments.  

I hope to continue my positive borrowing history with your institution and thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Meera Patel
