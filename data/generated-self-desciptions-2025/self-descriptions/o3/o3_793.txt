Dear Lending Committee,

My name is Stefan Kraus, 41, single, resident owner of a townhouse in Leipzig for the past four years. I have been Operations Manager at AluForm GmbH since August 2015, earning a net monthly income of €4,800. During these nine years I have twice repaid personal loans from your bank, most recently a €12,000 home-renovation loan cleared six months early.

I now request a €6,313 loan over 24 months to buy a 2019 Volkswagen Passat (68,000 km). The car is essential for my daily 45 km commute and for transporting my two nieces, for whom I am legal guardian. I have no other debts, have always paid utilities and taxes on time, and maintain a perfect credit record. Although I operate without a traditional checking account, all previous repayments were made by standing order from my salary card.

With steady income, owned housing and a flawless repayment history, I trust you will find me a low-risk borrower. I am ready to provide the purchase invoice and insurance confirmation immediately.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely  
Stefan Kraus



Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Miguel Alonso, 41, single, Spanish citizen living in Stuttgart since 2020 in a condominium I own. For the last ten years I have worked as a self-employed conference interpreter for the automotive sector, earning an average net income of €5,300 per month (books attached).

I request a €6,313 loan for 24 months to acquire a 2018 Škoda Octavia Combi (74,000 km). The car will let me reach client plants across Baden-Württemberg and drive my twin godsons, whom I support, to school activities. My current vehicle has exceeded 320,000 km and is no longer economical.

I hold one active loan with your bank—€9,000 for office equipment in 2021—serviced without a single delay; the balance will be cleared in November. I have no other liabilities and no checking account, settling all invoices directly from my business sub-ledger.

The combination of documented earnings, owned residence and spotless payment record makes me a dependable applicant. I look forward to continuing our successful relationship.

Kind regards  
Miguel Alonso



Dear Loan Department,

My name is Dr. Andreas Vogt, age 41, senior photovoltaics researcher at HelioTech AG in Freiburg. I have held this post for eight years, earning a net salary of €4,950 per month plus annual bonus. In 2019 your bank granted me a €5,000 relocation loan that I repaid in full last December.

I seek €6,313 repayable over 24 months to purchase a 2020 Renault Zoe for commuting and transporting my twin boys. Public transport to our laboratory is limited and my twelve-year-old car failed its emissions test.

My finances are healthy: no other loans, no revolving balances and monthly living costs of €2,300, leaving ample room for a €270 instalment. I live mortgage-free in a house inherited four years ago. Although I do not maintain a checking account, salary and repayments run through my employer’s salary card, from which I will set up automatic transfers.

Given my stable employment, property ownership and perfect credit history, I meet your risk criteria.

Thank you for your attention.

Respectfully  
Dr. Andreas Vogt



To the Lending Committee,

I am Officer Lars Ekström, Swedish national and senior customs officer at Hamburg Port since 2012. My net pay is €4,350 monthly. I reside, single, with my two dependent nephews in a condominium purchased outright four years ago.

I apply for a €6,313 loan over 24 months to buy a 2017 Ford Mondeo Estate. The vehicle is required for night shifts and family obligations; my current car was irreparably damaged in last month’s storm.

I have one outstanding credit with your bank—€14,000 for professional training opened in 2018—serviced punctually, with €3,100 remaining. I hold no other debts. Though I lack a separate checking account, my salary is paid onto a Treasury disbursement card from which standing orders are arranged.

Twelve years of government service and an unblemished repayment record demonstrate my reliability.

I appreciate your favourable consideration.

Sincerely  
Officer Lars Ekström



Dear Ms. Schneider,

I am Patrick Weber, 41, German citizen, single, guardian of two younger brothers in vocational school. For seven years I have been Regional Facilities Manager for NordMedi Kliniken GmbH in Bremen, earning a net €5,100 per month.

I request a €6,313 loan for 24 months to purchase a 2019 Opel Insignia. Reliable transport is indispensable for visiting nine hospital sites; the company reimburses mileage but does not provide a fleet car.

Your bank’s €12,500 renovation loan granted in 2020 was repaid three months early. I have no other credit lines or overdrafts. Fixed monthly expenses are €2,400, leaving ample capacity for the planned €265 instalment. Without a checking account, my salary is split between a payroll card and bond depot, from which I have never missed a payment.

With solid income, owned housing and a sterling repayment record, I believe I am an excellent candidate for this loan.

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards  
Patrick Weber
