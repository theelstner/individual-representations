Stuttgart, 21 September 2025  

Dear Loan Committee,  

My name is Ahmed Yildiz, 23, Turkish citizen, married, one son. I have been employed for 2 years and 4 months as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute, earning a net 2 150 DM per month on a permanent contract. I respectfully request a loan of 900 DM to purchase a reliable, fuel-efficient Opel Corsa so I can continue commuting to the institute’s new campus in Vaihingen.  

Although my current current-account balance is 200 DM overdrawn, I have never missed a payment: last year I repaid a 1 200 DM consumer loan with your bank three months ahead of schedule. The proposed instalment of 225 DM over four months fits comfortably within my budget; my wife’s part-time income covers household expenses, and we own our condominium outright, giving us low fixed costs.  

I am prepared to sign a wage-assignment clause and to allow the bank to debit each instalment directly on payday. My steady public-sector salary, clean repayment record and existing relationship with your branch make me a trustworthy borrower.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your positive reply.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Yildiz

Ingolstadt, 22 September 2025  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Carlos Mendez, 23, Spanish national, married with one daughter. Since July 2022 I have worked as a certified industrial electrician at Audi AG in Ingolstadt, earning a guaranteed net salary of 2 480 DM per month plus bonuses. I seek a 900 DM loan to replace my twelve-year-old Fiat Punto with a new company-discounted VW Up!, essential for my alternating early- and night-shift schedule.  

I have maintained my current account with you for a year; while it is presently 160 DM overdrawn, I have never exceeded my authorised limit. In 2023 I took a 1 500 DM loan from your bank for professional tools and paid it off exactly as agreed in ten instalments. I hold no other debts and my family and I live in the terraced house we purchased with savings from Spain.  

The planned repayment of 225 DM monthly over four months will not strain my budget; Audi’s works council can confirm the stability of my contract. I am willing to provide my wage slip and sign direct-debit authority.  

I appreciate your time and hope for a favourable decision.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendez

Dresden, 20 September 2025  

To the Credit Department,  

My name is Viktor Kovács, a 23-year-old married Hungarian customs officer employed by the Dresden municipal authority for 1 year and 8 months. My net salary is 2 030 DM. I am requesting a 900 DM loan to help fund the purchase of a low-emission Škoda Fabia, enabling me to perform on-site inspections outside the city.  

I have one prior credit with your bank—a 1 000 DM moving loan—fully repaid last month. My account shows a temporary overdraft of 95 DM but no missed payments. We reside in a small house I inherited; there is no mortgage or other liability.  

A fixed instalment of 225 DM over four months fits well within my disposable income, leaving over 1 000 DM each month for household needs after utilities. I authorise payroll deduction and can pledge the vehicle registration as collateral. My public-service position, property ownership and punctual credit record underline my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further documentation.  

Respectfully,  
Viktor Kovács

Nuremberg, 23 September 2025  

Dear Credit Officer,  

I, Igor Petrov, 23, Russian citizen, married with one child, have worked as a qualified CNC machinist at Siemens Energy in Nuremberg for 3 years and 2 months. My net monthly income averages 2 320 DM on a permanent contract. I kindly apply for a 900 DM loan to purchase a new Dacia Sandero. The reliable transport is vital for my rotating-shift employment, as public buses stop before my 4 a.m. starts.  

My only previous borrowing—600 DM for vocational training tools—was settled four months early. My current account is 120 DM in debit but always within the authorised overdraft. We live in an owner-occupied apartment bought cash from family savings; no other instalments exist.  

A repayment schedule of 225 DM over four months will be automatically debited the day after each payday, ensuring punctual servicing. Siemens HR can verify my contract, and I will sign voluntary wage assignment.  

With a stable income, verified repayment history and zero outstanding obligations, I believe I represent a low-risk customer. Thank you for your favourable consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Igor Petrov  



Letter 5  
Leipzig, 19 September 2025  

Dear Members of the Loan Panel,  

I am Marian Popescu, 23, Romanian national, widower with one two-year-old son. Since June 2024 I have served as a junior mail-routing official for Deutsche Post AG in Leipzig, earning a net 1 910 DM every month on a union-backed permanent contract. I request a 900 DM loan to acquire a small family car, a nearly new Ford Ka, enabling nursery drops before my 5 a.m. shift.  

Though my cheque account presently shows a 70 DM overdraft, my payment record is unblemished. The single credit I held with your institution—a 1 100 DM relocation loan—was paid in full this August. We reside in the studio apartment I bought last year, free of any lien. I do not carry credit cards or other loans.  

The proposed instalment rate of 225 DM for four consecutive months is manageable; my monthly budget allows a 500 DM surplus after essentials. I agree to automatic deductions and will furnish pay slips and residence title as proof of stability.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to continuing my good relationship with your bank.  

Faithfully yours,  
Marian Popescu
