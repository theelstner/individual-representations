Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the provided profile. First, I need to parse the profile carefully to make sure I include all the specific details.

The profile mentions a foreign worker, male, single, 37 years old, with a checking account under 0 DM, 36 months duration. Credit history is good, purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 3620 DM. Savings under 100 DM, employment since 1-4 years, installment rate 1, dependents 2, no other installment plans, housing is own, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, no telephone. Each letter needs to be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes.

So first, I need to invent five different scenarios. Let's see. The job is a skilled employee or official. Let me think of different roles: maybe a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a nurse, an IT technician, and a teacher. Each should have different reasons for the loan (furniture/equipment), but specific instances. For example, a research assistant might need a desk and chair for a home office, a mechanic might need tools, a nurse might need a hospital-grade treadmill, etc.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their existing credit is paid back, their employment duration (between 1-4 years), their savings, residence since 2 years, property as building society savings, etc. Also, they have a guarantor. Need to make sure each letter is unique but fits the profile.

Let me start with the first person. Let's say a scientific research assistant. He's been working at a university for 3 years. Needs furniture for a home office. Guarantor is his sister. Mention his stable income, existing credit (maybe a car loan) paid back duly. Savings are low but he's disciplined. Dependents: two children. Own house. 

Second person: maybe a mechanic. Worked at a garage for 2.5 years. Needs tools and equipment. Guarantor is his cousin. Similar structure.

Third: nurse needing medical equipment for home care. Fourth: IT technician needing a workstation. Fifth: teacher needing classroom supplies. Wait, but the purpose is furniture/equipment. Classroom supplies might be equipment. Okay.

Each letter should start with the applicant's info, then the bank's address. Then the body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Make sure to mention the guarantor, existing credit history, employment duration, savings, etc. Each letter should be concise, not too long, proper ending with thanks and signature.

Need to avoid generic terms. Use specific job titles, exact durations (like 8 years instead of >=7), but according to the profile, employment duration is 1-4 years. So maybe 3 years, 2.5 years, 18 months, etc. Also, age is 37, so same for all? Or vary slightly? The profile says age 37, so all applicants should be 37. Wait, the profile says age 37, so each person is 37. Hmm. Also, foreign worker yes, so each has foreign nationality. Dependents 2. Housing own. Savings <100 DM. Existing credit at the bank: 1. Credit history: existing credits paid back duly. Installment rate 1. 

Need to make sure each letter includes these elements. Also, telephone: none, so maybe they don't have a phone, but maybe in the letters, it's not necessary to mention unless it's relevant. But since it's part of the profile, perhaps mention that they don't have a telephone, but maybe it's better to omit unless necessary. The user said to invent specific instances of all generic attributes. So for telephone:none, maybe they don't have a phone, but perhaps it's not necessary to mention in the letter unless it's part of the financial situation. Maybe better to leave it out unless it's relevant. The user said to include all generic attributes, so perhaps mention that they don't have a telephone, but maybe it's not critical. Let me check the original instruction: "Invent specific instances of all generic attributes from the profile". So for telephone:none, perhaps they don't have a landline, but maybe they have a mobile. But in the profile, it's "none", so maybe they don't have any telephone. But in modern times, that's unusual. Maybe they have a mobile, but in the data, it's "none". So perhaps in the letter, we don't mention it unless it's relevant. Maybe better to omit unless necessary.

Each letter should be unique. Let me start drafting the first one.

First person: Scientific Research Assistant. Name: Mr. Ahmed Hassan. Employed at a university for 3 years. Needs furniture for a home office. Guarantor is his sister. Existing credit: a car loan paid back. Savings are 80 DM. Lives in his own house for 2 years. Two children. Trustworthy because of good credit history and stable job. 

Second person: Automotive Mechanic. Name: Mr. Carlos Mendez. Worked at a garage for 2.5 years. Needs tools and equipment. Guarantor is his cousin. Same structure.

Third: Nurse. Name: Mr. Raj Patel. Needs medical equipment for home care. Guarantor is his brother. 

Fourth: IT Technician. Name: Mr. Michael Nguyen. Needs a workstation for freelance work. Guarantor is his friend.

Fifth: Maybe a teacher? Or another role. Let's say a Construction Site Supervisor. Needs equipment for his job. Guarantor is his colleague.

Each letter should have a unique scenario. Let me check the profile again to make sure all attributes are covered. Each has:

- Checking account <0 DM (overdrawn?)

But in the letters, maybe they mention that their checking account is currently in a negative balance due to recent expenses, but they have a stable income.

Savings <100 DM: mention that they have minimal savings but are disciplined.

Existing credit paid back duly: mention that they have a previous loan (e.g., car, appliance) with the bank that they repaid.

Employment since 1-4 years: specific duration.

Dependents: 2 children.

Housing: own.

Property: building society savings agreement. Maybe mention that they have a building society savings plan.

Guarantor: different for each person.

Now, let's draft each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered and each is unique.

**Letter 1**  
To [Bank Name],  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, a 37-year-old scientific research assistant employed at the University of Munich for the past three years. I am applying for a 3,620 DM loan to purchase a high-quality desk, ergonomic chair, and a dual-monitor setup for my home office. My current checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to recent medical expenses for my two children, but I have consistently paid my existing car loan (my only credit) on time for 24 months.  

I reside in my own apartment and have maintained a building society savings agreement for five years. Though my savings account holds only 80 DM, I have a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM and a guarantor in my sister, who works as a nurse. I am committed to repaying this loan responsibly, as my role requires me to meet strict deadlines, and my employer has confirmed my contract will extend for at least two more years.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

Thank you for your trust.
