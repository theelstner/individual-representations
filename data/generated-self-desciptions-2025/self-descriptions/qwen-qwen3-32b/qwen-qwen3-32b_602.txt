Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required elements.

First, the profile details: checking account balance is between 0 and 200 DM, duration of 7 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is for radio/television. Credit amount is 2329 DM. Savings account is less than 100 DM. Present employment for less than a year. Installment rate 1. Female, married, divorced, or separated. Guarantor for other debtors. Residence since 1 month. Property is real estate. Age 45. No other installment plans. Own housing. One existing credit at the bank. Job as a skilled employee or official. One dependent. No telephone. Foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be from a different person. So I need to vary the specific details while keeping them within the profile's parameters. Let me think of different scenarios. For example, maybe a teacher, a nurse, an office clerk, a technician, and a researcher. Each with different job titles, reasons for the loan (though the purpose is radio/television, maybe they have specific reasons like a home business, educational use, etc.), and different personal circumstances.

I need to make sure each letter includes why they need the loan, their financial situation (checking account, savings, employment duration, existing credit history), and why they're trustworthy. Also, mention the guarantor, residence, property, etc.

Let me start with the first person. Let's say a primary school teacher. She's been working for 8 years but only at her current job for less than a year. She needs the TV for her children's education. She has a guarantor, maybe a sibling. She has real estate, so she can mention that as collateral. She's a foreign worker, so maybe she mentions her stable employment and payment history.

Second person: a nurse. Maybe she's applying for a radio for a home-based business, like selling music. She's been in her residence for 1 month because she recently moved for work. She has a guarantor, perhaps a parent. She's been in her job for 9 months, so under a year. She mentions her savings are low but she has real estate.

Third person: office clerk. She wants the TV for her family's entertainment. She's been employed at her current job for 6 months. She has a guarantor, maybe a cousin. She emphasizes her history of paying back credits and her stable housing.

Fourth person: technical assistant. Needs the TV for her son's educational programs. Guarantor is her sister. She's been in her residence for 1 month because she moved for a job. She mentions her previous credit was for a car and paid back.

Fifth person: scientific research assistant. She needs the TV for her home lab to watch tutorials. Guarantor is her mother. She's been working in her current role for 8 months. She has real estate and a stable income.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, specific, and includes all necessary elements. Avoid generic terms. Use exact numbers where possible. Also, each letter should have a proper closing without any formatting. Let me check each letter to ensure they meet the profile's requirements and don't miss any attributes. Also, ensure that each person has a unique job and specific reasons for the loan, even though the purpose is radio/television. Maybe vary the exact purpose within the category. Also, make sure the guarantor is mentioned each time, along with the existing credit paid back, residence duration, employment duration, etc.

I should also check that each letter starts with the applicant's name, address, date, and the bank's address. But since the user didn't specify including addresses, maybe just start with the salutation. Wait, the user didn't mention addresses, so maybe just the body of the letter. The example response starts with "Dear Sir or Madam," so I'll follow that.

Each letter should have a subject line mentioning the loan application. Then the body explaining the purpose, financial situation, and trustworthiness. Conclude with gratitude and a closing.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered and the details are specific. Also, check that the numbers align with the profile (e.g., 7 months for checking account, less than a year at job, etc.).

Dear Sir or Madam  
I am writing to apply for a loan of 2329 DM to purchase a television for my home. As a primary school teacher with eight years of experience, I currently earn a stable monthly income of 2800 DM. My existing checking account has been active for seven months with a balance of 150 DM, and I maintain a savings account with 80 DM. Though I have only worked at my current school for nine months, I have a strong payment history, having fully repaid a previous car loan through this bank.  

I reside in my own apartment, which I own, and have lived there since moving to Germany six months ago as a foreign worker. My sister, a nurse, has kindly agreed to act as a guarantor for this loan. With one dependent child and a monthly installment capacity of 1 DM, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan responsibly. Your support would greatly assist in enhancing our family’s access to educational programming.  

Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

Dear Sir or Madam  
I am applying for a 2329 DM loan to invest in a radio for my small home-based music resale business. As a licensed nurse employed at St. Lukas Hospital for six months, I earn 3100 DM monthly. My checking account, open for seven months, holds 90 DM, while my savings amount to 50 DM. I have no outstanding debts beyond this application and have consistently repaid my prior credit here.  

I have lived in my owned property for one month after relocating from Poland for work and am supported as a guarantor by my mother, who resides in Wrocław. At 45 years old, I balance my job with caring for my daughter, but my stable income and real estate ownership ensure my reliability. This loan will expand my business, allowing me to repay installments promptly.  

Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,

Dear Sir or Madam  
I seek a 2329 DM loan to purchase a television for my household. As an office clerk at a logistics firm for eight months, I earn 2600 DM monthly. My checking account, active for seven months, currently holds 70 DM, and my savings bonds total 40 DM. I have repaid all prior credits without issue, including a 12-month loan for home repairs.  

I own my residence, though I have lived here for only one month after accepting a job transfer from Hungary. My cousin, a teacher, has agreed to guarantee this loan. With one dependent and a disciplined budget allocating 1 DM monthly for repayments, I am committed to fulfilling this obligation. This television will provide essential news and educational content for my family.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir or Madam  
I am requesting a 2329 DM loan to acquire a television to support my son’s studies. As a technical assistant at an engineering firm for 10 months, I earn 2900 DM monthly. My checking account, open for seven months, holds 120 DM, and I have 30 DM in savings bonds. I have no pending debts and have fully repaid a prior loan for professional certification.  

I own my home but relocated here one month ago for work as a foreign worker from Romania. My older brother, employed as an electrician, will act as my guarantor. At 45, I prioritize financial responsibility, and this loan aligns with my ability to manage installments. Your approval would greatly benefit my household’s educational resources.  

Thank you for your time.  
Sincerely,
