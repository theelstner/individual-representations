Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. First, I need to parse the profile details carefully.

The profile has specific attributes: checking account under 0 DM, 18 months duration, good credit history, purpose is radio/television, credit amount 2389 DM, savings under 100 DM, present employment under 1 year, installment rate 4, female, divorced/married, no other debtors, residence since 1 month, property like car, age 27, other installment plans in stores, housing own, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee/official, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

Each letter needs to be from a different person, so I need to vary the specifics while sticking to the profile. Let me think about different scenarios. Maybe different nationalities, jobs, reasons for the loan. For example, one could be a nurse, another a teacher, maybe an office worker, a technician, etc. Each should have a unique angle for needing the loan, like a radio for a small business, TV for educational purposes, or for a child's needs.

I need to make sure each letter includes the financial situation as per the profile: current job for less than a year, existing credit paid back, savings low. Also, mention why they're trustworthy: reliable payments, stable job, etc. Since they’re foreign workers, maybe mention their intention to settle or their ties to the community.

Avoid generic terms. Instead of "skilled employee," use specific roles. Also, the purpose is radio/TV, but maybe each has a slightly different reason. For example, one might need a TV for language learning, another for business communication.

Check for conciseness. Each letter should be short but complete, with proper beginning and ending. No formatting, just plain text. Need to ensure that each letter starts with the applicant's info, addresses the bank, explains the purpose, financial status, trustworthiness, and thanks.

Also, consider the profile's negative aspects: low savings, new residence, new job. Need to address these indirectly. For example, mention that despite being new, they have a stable income and have managed previous credit well.

Let me brainstorm five different profiles:

1. Nurse from Philippines, needs TV for language courses to integrate better.
2. Teacher from Mexico, wants radio for her small sewing business to communicate with suppliers.
3. Office worker from India, needs TV for his daughter's education since they live far from school.
4. Technician from Nigeria, requires radio for his electronics repair business to stay updated.
5. Administrative assistant from Colombia, wants TV to attend online courses for career advancement.

Each has a unique job, nationality, and purpose. Now, structure each letter with these specifics, ensuring all profile points are covered without being too obvious. Make sure to mention existing credit, job duration, savings, etc., in a natural way. Also, highlight trustworthiness through timely payments and current employment.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Amina Hassan and I am a 27 year old medical nurse from Nigeria currently working at the St Lucia Clinic in Frankfurt. I have been employed there for 11 months and hold a skilled employee position as part of the German healthcare system. I am applying for a 2389 DM loan to purchase a television which I will use to follow German language courses essential for my professional integration.  

Although my checking account balance is currently negative due to recent visa processing fees I have consistently paid back my existing 1200 DM housing credit over the past 18 months. I own a used car valued at 4500 DM and have lived in my current apartment for 1 month. My monthly income of 2800 DM allows me to manage a 4 DM installment rate comfortably while supporting my 8 year old daughter. As a foreign worker committed to long term settlement I prioritize financial responsibility and would gladly provide my employer's confirmation of employment.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Amina Hassan

Dear Sir/Madam  

As a divorced 27 year old primary school teacher from Mexico I need a radio for my small sewing business in Munich. I have worked at the International School for 9 months and earn 2600 DM monthly. My current savings of 80 DM are insufficient to buy a professional radio for fabric supplier communications.  

I have fully repaid my existing 1500 DM furniture loan and maintain a good credit history. Though I relocated to Germany 1 month ago I own property in my hometown and have a stable job. My 5 year old son lives with me and I ensure all payments are made promptly. I am willing to provide my employment contract and proof of timely credit repayments.  

This loan will directly increase my business efficiency. I appreciate your trust.  

Respectfully  
Maria Sanchez

To Whom It May Concern  

I am a 27 year old administrative assistant from India working at the Siemens Office in Berlin. After 10 months in this skilled employee role I require a television to attend evening engineering courses improving my career prospects. My current 2300 DM monthly salary covers a 4 DM installment plan for this 2389 DM purchase.  

While my checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to medication costs I have no other debts except my 12 month paid-off mobile phone credit. I own a car worth 3800 DM and have resided in my apartment for 1 month. As a foreign worker with a 5 year employment contract I value reliability and have never defaulted on payments.  

I enclose my employer's letter and savings book showing consistent income. Thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards

Dear Bank Officer  

As a 27 year old divorced electrical technician from the Philippines I need a radio for my freelance electronics repair work in Hamburg. My 11 month old job at the local factory pays 2700 DM monthly but my savings of 50 DM are inadequate. This equipment will help me bid for larger contracts.  

I have repaid my only existing 1000 DM appliance credit and have no other debts. Though I arrived in Germany 1 month ago I have maintained timely payments on all bills. I own a vehicle valued at 4200 DM and support my 6 year old daughter. My employer can confirm my stable income and work ethic.  

I understand the importance of financial discipline and am prepared to provide any additional documentation.  

With gratitude

Dear Banking Department  

I am a 27 year old married office clerk from Colombia working at the Dusseldorf Insurance Company. With 9 months of employment here I need a television to connect with my family back home and manage cultural adjustment. My 2500 DM salary comfortably handles the proposed 4 DM installment rate.  

My checking account is currently negative due to unexpected car repairs but I have paid all previous credits including my 1400 DM furniture loan. I reside in my own apartment and own a 3500 DM vehicle. As a foreign worker committed to Germany I have no other installment plans except this application.  

I have attached my pay slips and credit history. I assure you of my reliability through 8 years of consistent employment records abroad.  

Thank you for your time.  

Yours faithfully  
Catalina Ortega
