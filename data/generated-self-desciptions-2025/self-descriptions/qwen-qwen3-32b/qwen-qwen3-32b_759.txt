Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me break them down:

- Checking account: at least 200 DM, salary assigned for at least 1 year. Duration in months: 15. So the account has been open for 15 months.
- Credit history: critical account or other credits existing but not at this bank. So they have some credit issues elsewhere.
- Purpose: radio/television. The loan amount is 1271 DM.
- Savings account: unknown, but no savings account. So they don't have one.
- Employment: present job for 1 to less than 4 years. The job is skilled employee or official. Let me pick specific jobs, like scientific research assistant, electrician, etc.
- Installment rate: 3. Not sure what that means exactly, but maybe the monthly payment is 3% or 3 DM? Maybe it's the number of installments? Wait, the original data might have different units. Maybe it's the monthly installment amount. Let me check the original query again. The user says "installment rate:3". Probably, the monthly payment is 3% of income or something. But maybe in the letter, it's better to mention the monthly payment amount as 3% of their salary or a fixed amount. Hmm. Maybe the user wants to include that they can afford a 3% installment rate. Let me note that.

Personal status: male, single. Other debtors/guarantors: none. Residence since 4 years. Property: unknown/no property. Age: 39. Dependents: 1. Telephone: yes. Foreign worker: registered under their name.

So each person should have these attributes but with specific instances. Let me think of different professions. The job is skilled employee or official. Let me pick five different ones. For example:

1. Scientific research assistant
2. Electrician
3. Municipal office clerk
4. Automotive mechanic
5. Public school administrator

Each person needs to explain why they need the loan (radio/TV), their financial situation (stable salary, existing checking account, employment duration, etc.), and why they're trustworthy despite having other credits (maybe they've managed them well).

They should mention their stable job, length of employment, existing checking account, residence duration, and maybe their responsibility in managing other credits. Also, they have a dependent, so they need to show that they can manage the loan without issues.

Let me start drafting the first one. Let's take the scientific research assistant. He has been employed for 2.5 years, has a checking account for 15 months, and has other credits not at this bank. He's 39, single, with one dependent. He needs a TV for his family. He can mention his stable income, the purpose of the loan, and that he's responsible with other debts.

For each letter, structure should be:

- Greeting
- Introduction: purpose of the letter (applying for loan)
- Financial situation: job, employment duration, checking account, residence, etc.
- Credit history: mention existing credits but managed responsibly
- Why trustworthy: stable income, responsible, etc.
- Purpose of loan: TV, to improve family life
- Conclusion: request approval, thanks

Make sure each letter is unique in the specific details. Let me check the numbers again: employment since 1-4 years, so each person has between 1 to 4 years at current job. Let me assign different numbers: 2.5, 3, 1.5, 2, 3.5 years. Also, the checking account has been open for 15 months (1 year and 3 months). Each person's employment duration is within 1-4 years. Also, they have other credits not at this bank, so they need to address that but show they can handle more.

Also, they have a dependent, so maybe mention that they are providing for a family. The purpose is radio/TV, so maybe they want to have a TV for educational purposes, entertainment, etc.

Now, let me draft each letter one by one, ensuring they are concise and include all necessary details without being too long. Avoid using formatting, just plain text with paragraphs separated by line breaks. Each letter should end properly with a sign-off.

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing to apply for a loan of 1271 DM to purchase a television for my household. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed for 2.5 years and earn a stable monthly salary of 2400 DM. My checking account, open for 15 months, consistently maintains a balance above 200 DM, and I have held this account for over a year with regular salary deposits. Though I currently have a small personal loan for my car repayment through another institution, I manage it responsibly with timely payments. I reside in my current apartment for 4 years and am a registered foreign worker with a valid telephone contract. With one dependent, I prioritize financial stability and view this loan as an opportunity to enhance our family’s quality of life. I kindly request your consideration and am happy to provide further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

Dear Bank Manager,  
I respectfully request a 1271 DM loan to acquire a radio and television set. As a certified electrician at Siemens since January 2021, I have a secure income of 2300 DM per month. My checking account, active for 15 months, reflects consistent salary assignments and a disciplined approach to finances. While I have an existing consumer loan for a bicycle through a cooperative bank, I have maintained a 98% on-time payment rate. I have lived in my current residence for 4 years and am registered as a foreign worker. My single status allows me to allocate funds efficiently, and I am confident in managing this loan alongside my current obligations. The television will provide educational content for my child and entertainment for our home. Thank you for your trust.  

Best regards,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for a 1271 DM loan to purchase a television set. As a municipal office clerk in Dresden, I have worked for 3 years with a monthly salary of 2100 DM. My checking account, open for 15 months, has remained in good standing with no overdrafts. I currently repay a small credit for computer equipment through a different lender, which I have consistently paid on time. I have resided at my current address for 4 years and own a mobile phone contract. Though I have no savings account, I carefully budget my income to cover all expenses. This television will improve my family’s access to news and educational programming. I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan responsibly.  

Yours faithfully,  
Markus Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I seek your approval for a 1271 DM loan to buy a television. As an automotive mechanic at Autohaus Berlin since July 2022, I earn 2200 DM monthly and have a stable employment history. My checking account, active for 15 months, reflects regular salary deposits and careful spending. While I have an outstanding loan for motorcycle repairs through a local credit union, I have never missed a payment. I have lived in my apartment for 4 years and am registered under the foreign worker program. With one dependent, I prioritize financial responsibility and view this loan as a step toward improving our household’s comfort. I am prepared to provide any additional information to support my application.  

Respectfully,  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Bank Officer,  
I am writing to request a 1271 DM loan for a television purchase. As a public school administrator in Hamburg, I have worked for 3.5 years with a salary of 2350 DM per month.

I have resided in my current home for 4 years and hold a valid landline telephone. Though I lack a savings account, I allocate funds meticulously to meet all obligations. This television will serve as a valuable resource for educational programming and family bonding. I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling this loan’s terms.  

Sincerely,
