Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the requirements.

First, the profile mentions a checking account with less than 0 DM, which is negative. The duration is 6 months, so not long. Credit history is critical, and there are other credits not at this bank. The purpose is furniture/equipment, and the amount is 1872 DM. Savings are under 100 DM. The person is unemployed but has a job in management, self-employed, or similar roles. They have dependents (1), a phone, and are a registered foreign worker. They've been in their residence for 4 years, no property, and have 3 existing credits at the bank.

I need to create five different scenarios. Let me think of different jobs within the job category mentioned. The job category includes management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, officer. So possible roles could be a project manager, freelance graphic designer, IT consultant, self-employed electrician, or a restaurant manager. Each person should have a unique reason for the loan, maybe different types of furniture or equipment they need.

Each letter needs to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their unemployment but also their job status. Wait, the profile says "Present employment since: unemployed" but the job is in management/self-employed. That seems conflicting. Maybe they are currently unemployed but previously had a job? Or perhaps they are self-employed, which might be considered as not having a traditional employment status. Need to clarify that in the letters. Maybe they are between jobs but have a stable self-employment or contract work.

Also, the existing credits at the bank are 3. So each applicant has three existing loans with the bank. They need to address their credit history being critical. They should explain how they will manage the new installment of 4 DM. Maybe they have a plan to repay, or their income is sufficient despite being unemployed (if self-employed or contract work).

Let me outline each person:

1. Project Manager: Recently unemployed but has freelance projects. Needs furniture for a new home office to secure contracts. Trustworthy because of past credits and steady income from projects.

2. Freelance Graphic Designer: Self-employed, needs equipment (computers, software) to expand business. Has dependents, mentions savings are low but has existing credits managed well.

3. IT Consultant: Between jobs, has contract offers. Needs to furnish a workspace to start new contracts. Trustworthy due to previous loan repayments and steady freelance income.

4. Self-Employed Electrician: Needs tools and equipment for business growth. Currently has some unemployment gap but has a history of managing credits.

5. Restaurant Manager: Recently became self-employed, needs kitchen equipment. Trustworthy because of existing credits and steady income from restaurant.

Each letter should mention specific details like their job role, how long they've been in their current role, specific furniture or equipment needed, how they'll repay (installment rate 4 DM), and address their credit history by showing responsibility.

Make sure each letter is concise, starts with their name and address, then the bank's address, subject, body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and a polite closing. Avoid formatting, just plain text. Each letter should be unique in the specifics but fit the profile constraints.

Check that each applicant has a different job and scenario. Also, ensure they mention being unemployed but have a job in the profile category. Maybe they are transitioning between jobs, self-employed with irregular income but steady contracts.

Now, draft each letter with these points in mind. Make sure to use specific numbers and instances from the profile: 36 years old, 1 dependent, 4 years residence, 3 existing credits, 4 DM installment, etc.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Mr. Lars Müller  
123 Berlin Street  
Berlin  

To the Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a 1,872 DM loan to purchase essential office furniture for my home workspace. As a freelance project manager, I have secured three contracts in the past month but lack the equipment to meet client demands. Though unemployed for six weeks due to transitioning between roles, my average monthly income remains 2,500 DM from project-based work. I currently have three existing credits with your bank, all paid punctually, and manage my finances despite a critical credit history. With a dependent child and stable freelance income, I am committed to repaying 4 DM monthly installments. My four-year residency and registered telephone number reflect my stability. I kindly request your trust in my ability to succeed.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Ms. Anna Weber  
456 Munich Avenue  
Munich  

To the Loan Committee,  

As a self-employed graphic designer, I need a high-performance computer and design tools to expand my client base. After losing my full-time position 8 months ago, I rebuilt my business, earning 1,800 DM monthly. While my savings are low (95 DM), I have repaid three prior loans with your bank without default. My critical credit history stems from previous unemployment, but my current workload guarantees repayment of 4 DM installments. I reside in my apartment for four years and support one dependent. Your approval would enable me to deliver projects faster, ensuring timely payments.  

Thank you for considering my application.  
Anna Weber

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Mr. Thomas Becker  
789 Hamburg Road  
Hamburg  

To the Loan Committee,  

I seek 1,872 DM to furnish a co-working space for my IT consulting business. Though unemployed since March, I secured contract work with two tech firms, earning 2,200 DM monthly. My critical credit history reflects past reliance on multiple loans, but I now prioritize repayment. With three existing credits at your bank paid in full each month, I demonstrate responsibility. At 36, I support my daughter and maintain a four-year residence. My self-employment in IT guarantees income, and I am prepared to allocate 4 DM monthly toward this loan.  

Gratefully,  
Thomas Becker

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Mr. Karim Adebayo  
101 Cologne Lane  
Cologne  

To the Loan Committee,  

As a self-employed electrician, I require tools and a van to scale my business. After being furloughed last year, I launched my contracting firm, generating 2,000 DM monthly. My savings are minimal (80 DM), but three existing credits with your bank show my reliability. I acknowledge my critical credit history and have reduced unnecessary expenses to ensure 4 DM installments. With one dependent and a four-year local residency, I am committed to repaying this loan. Your support will help me secure larger contracts and stabilize my income.  

Respectfully,  
Karim Adebayo

**Motivation Letter 5**  
Mr. Erik Jensen  
202 Frankfurt Blvd  
Frankfurt  

To the Loan Committee,  

I need funds for kitchen equipment to launch my catering business. Unemployed for five months after leaving a management role, I leveraged my culinary training to book 15 events, earning 1,900 DM monthly. My critical credit history stems from prior job transitions, but I now prioritize repayments. With three active loans at your bank and a 4-year residence, I am a stable candidate. Supporting my son and equipped with a registered phone, I assure you of my dedication to repaying 4 DM monthly. This loan will formalize my business and ensure timely payments.  

Sincerely,  
Erik Jensen
