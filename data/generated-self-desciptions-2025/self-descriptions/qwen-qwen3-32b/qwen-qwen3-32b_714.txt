Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. First, I need to parse the profile details carefully.

The profile includes specific attributes: no checking account, 21 months duration, good credit history, purpose is a used car, credit amount 2476, no savings account, employment for at least 7 years, installment rate 4, single male, no debtors, residence since 4 years, property is real estate, age 46, no other installment plans, housing is own, one existing credit at the bank, job in management/self-employed/highly qualified, one dependent, has a phone, foreign worker registered.

Each letter needs to be unique, with specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant" as in the example. So I need to invent different jobs within the job category mentioned. Let me list possible jobs: maybe a project manager, IT manager, senior engineer, team leader, or something like that. Each person should have a distinct profession.

Also, each letter should explain why they need the loan (used car), their financial situation (stable job, existing credit paid back, own house, etc.), and why they're trustworthy. They don't have a checking account, but they have a savings account or bonds? Wait, the profile says savings account is unknown/no. So maybe mention that they don't have one but have other assets like real estate.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, not too long, and properly ended. No formatting, just plain text. Let me start drafting each one.

First person: Maybe a project manager at a construction company. He needs a car for commuting. He's been employed for 8 years, has a stable income, owns a house. He has a existing credit (maybe a mortgage?) paid back. He's single with one child. Uses the phone number. Trustworthy because of his job and repayment history.

Second person: IT department manager. Let's say he works for a software firm. Needs a car for client visits. Employed for 7 years. Owns real estate. Maybe he mentions his dependents and how the car will help with their needs. Trustworthy due to stable income and existing credit.

Third: Senior mechanical engineer. Works in manufacturing. Needs a car for daily commute. Employed for 9 years. Owns a house. Maybe he mentions his savings in bonds? Wait, the profile says unknown/no savings account. Hmm, so maybe he can't mention savings. Instead, focus on real estate and job stability.

Fourth: Self-employed consultant. Maybe a business consultant. Has been in business for 8 years. Needs a car for client meetings. Since he's self-employed, need to highlight steady income and existing credit. Owns property. Has a dependent. Trustworthy because of business stability.

Fifth: Team leader in pharmaceutical company. Needs a car for work-related travel. Employed for 7 years. Owns real estate. Single with one child. Trustworthy because of long-term employment and good credit history.

Now, each letter should start with the person's name, address, date, bank address. Then the body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Make sure each has specific numbers: e.g., 8 years employment, 21 months at current address (wait, the profile says duration in month:21 – does that refer to the checking account? But the person has no checking account. Maybe that's a different part. Wait, the profile says "Duration in month:21" but "no checking account". Maybe that's not relevant for the letters. Maybe the letters can ignore that unless necessary.

Each letter must mention the purpose (used car), credit amount 2476, installment rate 4. Also, mention existing credit paid back, current job duration >=7 years, residence since 4 years, real estate, etc.

Need to avoid generic terms. Use specific instances. Also, each letter should end properly with a closing.

Let me check each letter for uniqueness. Different jobs, different reasons for needing the car (commute, client visits, business needs, etc.), different employment durations, maybe different aspects of their financial stability highlighted.

Make sure not to use any formatting. Just plain text with paragraphs separated by line breaks. Also, ensure that each letter is from a different person with distinct professions and specific details.
