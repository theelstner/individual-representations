Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for bank loan applications based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says the person has no checking account but has been with their current employer for 1 to 4 years. The purpose of the loan is a new car, and the amount is 1204 DM. They have a savings account between 100-500 DM. Their job is a skilled employee or official, age 35, single with one dependent, renting, no phone, and one existing credit at the bank. All credits paid back duly, no other debtors or guarantors, and they've been in their residence for 1 year.

I need to create five different people with specific instances. Let me brainstorm some unique scenarios. Maybe different job roles, reasons for the car, and personal circumstances. For example, a mechanic, a teacher, a nurse, a software developer, and a delivery driver. Each should have a unique angle on why they need the car. 

First person: Let's say a mechanic. He needs a car to get to work reliably. He's been employed for 3 years, has a savings of 200 DM. Emphasize punctual payments and responsibility.

Second: A teacher. Maybe she needs a car for commuting and transporting students. She's been at her job for 2.5 years, has 300 DM in savings. Highlight her commitment to her job and dependents.

Third: A nurse working night shifts. Needs a reliable car for irregular hours. Employed for 3 years, 150 DM savings. Stress the importance of the car for work and dependents.

Fourth: A software developer working remotely but needs a car for client visits. Employed for 2 years, 400 DM savings. Mention his stable income and existing credit.

Fifth: A delivery driver needing a car for work. He's been in the job for 1.5 years, 100 DM savings. Emphasize the necessity for his job and timely payments.

Now, each letter should include the loan purpose, financial situation (savings, employment duration, existing credit), and trustworthiness (credit history, stable job). Make sure each person's details are specific and unique. Avoid generic terms. Check for proper structure: start with address, date, bank address, body explaining the reason, financial status, repayment ability, and a polite closing. Keep each letter concise, around a paragraph each. No formatting, just plain text with line breaks.

Wait, the user said not to use any formatting, so no bold or italics. Also, each letter must be from a different person with distinct jobs and reasons. Let me make sure each one has different numbers and specifics. For example, different employment durations within 1-4 years, different savings amounts between 100-500, different dependents (though the profile says 1 dependent, so maybe same but different contexts). Also, check that they all mention the existing credit at the bank and that they've paid back duly. Each should have a unique angle but fit the profile.

Let me start drafting each one, ensuring they are distinct and follow the profile. Make sure to mention the exact loan amount (1204 DM), purpose as new car, and the other attributes. Also, mention that they don't have a checking account, but that's part of the profile. Maybe explain that they manage their finances through a savings account. Since they have no checking account, maybe they use cash or direct deposits? But since they have an existing credit at the bank, perhaps they have some relationship. Maybe they have a savings account there. Each letter should address the bank's concerns about trustworthiness despite no checking account. Emphasize their stable job, timely payments, and savings as proof of responsibility.

I need to ensure that each letter is self-contained, with specific numbers and roles. Let me check for repetition and uniqueness. Once done, review each for proper structure and content.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Thomas Müller, and I am a 35-year-old automotive mechanic employed at Autohaus Berlin. I have worked there for 3 years and earn a stable monthly income of 2,200 DM. I am applying for a 1,204 DM loan to purchase a new car, as my current vehicle is no longer reliable for my daily 45-minute commute. I have 200 DM in a savings account and have consistently paid back my existing bank credit for a smartphone over the past year. Though I do not currently have a checking account, I manage my finances responsibly through direct deposits and have no prior debts. I am a single father to a 6-year-old daughter, and a reliable car is essential to maintain my job and support her. I kindly request your approval based on my stable employment and punctual repayment history.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Müller  



Dear [Bank Name],  

I am Lars Schmidt, a 35-year-old biology teacher at Berlin-Ost Secondary School, employed for 2.5 years. I seek a 1,204 DM loan to buy a new car, as public transport is insufficient for my rural teaching assignments. My monthly salary is 2,400 DM, and I have 300 DM in savings bonds. I have fully repaid my only previous credit—a student loan—and have no other debts. While I do not hold a checking account, I have paid all bills on time and maintain a disciplined budget. I live with my 8-year-old son, and a car is vital for my work and family needs. I assure you of timely repayments and request your trust in my financial responsibility.  

Best regards,  
Lars Schmidt  



Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Janina Weber, a 35-year-old registered nurse at Charité Hospital. I have worked there for 3 years and earn 2,600 DM monthly. I need a new car to manage my rotating night shifts and transport my 5-year-old son to school. I currently have 150 DM in a savings account and no checking account, but I have always managed my finances prudently. My existing bank credit for a laptop was repaid in full, and I have no other outstanding debts. A reliable vehicle is critical for my job and family. I kindly ask for your support, confident in my stable income and commitment to repayment.  

Yours faithfully,  
Janina Weber

I have one dependent—a 3-year-old daughter—and a stable repayment history with my existing bank credit for a computer. I assure you of my ability to meet installments and request your approval for this necessary investment.
