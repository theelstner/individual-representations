Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile has several key points: no checking account, 36 months duration, critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank, purpose is a used car, credit amount 10,477, no savings account, employed for at least 7 years, installment rate 2, male single, no co-debtors, residence since 4 years, no property, age 42, no other installment plans, housing for free, two existing credits at this bank, job as skilled employee or official, one dependent, no phone, foreign worker.

First, I need to create five distinct individuals. Each should have specific roles, names, and unique situations. Let me brainstorm different job roles for the "skilled employee / official" category. Maybe a mechanic, a nurse, a teacher, an IT technician, and a carpenter. Each will have different reasons for needing a car. For example, a nurse might need reliable transport for night shifts, a teacher for commuting, a mechanic to reach job sites, etc.

Each letter must explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their stable employment (7+ years), existing credits at the bank (two), residence duration (4 years), and being a foreign worker. Also, they have a critical credit history elsewhere but are managing current credits. Need to show they can handle repayments with the installment rate of 2.

I need to ensure each letter is concise, no formatting, proper endings. Let me outline each person:

1. **Mohammed Ahmed, 42, Automotive Mechanic (Foreign Worker from Egypt)**: Needs a van for work. Stable job 8 years, two existing loans at the bank. Lives with family, one dependent. Emphasize timely payments and need for reliable transport.

2. **Rajesh Kumar, 42, Nursing Assistant (from India)**: Needs a car for night shifts and dependent mother. Employed 7 years, lives in the same residence 4 years. Highlight punctual payments and essential transport for job.

3. **Lars Müller, 42, IT Support Technician (from Poland)**: Applying for a sedan to commute. 10 years in job, two existing credits. Needs car for job security and to support his child.

4. **Amina Diallo, 42, Carpenter (from Senegal)**: Needs a pickup truck for work. 9 years in current job, stable income. Emphasize timely repayments and car necessity for work.

5. **Tomasz Nowak, 42, Public Administration Clerk (from Poland)**: Requires a used car for commuting. 8 years employed, supports mother. Highlight responsibility and existing credits managed well.

Now, I need to flesh out each letter with these details, making sure each has unique specifics and flows naturally. Avoid generic terms, use exact numbers (like 8 years instead of >=7). Each should start with the applicant's info, purpose, financial stability, and trustworthiness. End with gratitude and contact info.

Check for consistency in the profile attributes: all are male, single, 42, foreign workers, 4 years residence, 2 existing credits, etc. Also, no phone, so maybe mention that they can be contacted via their residence or another method. But since telephone is none, maybe omit contact info except address.

Make sure each letter is distinct in their reasons and jobs. Avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan. Each should have a unique angle: work necessity, family support, commuting, etc.

Now, draft each letter step by step, ensuring they meet all criteria.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
My name is Mohammed Ahmed, a 42-year-old automotive mechanic employed at City Auto Repairs for the past 8 years. I am applying for a loan of €10,477 to purchase a reliable used van to support my work, which often requires transporting tools and parts between job sites. Although I currently have no checking account, I maintain two existing credits with your bank, both repaid punctually for over 24 months. I reside in my current home for 4 years and support my elderly mother as my sole dependent. Despite a past critical account with another lender, I have stabilized my finances through consistent income. I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan with the proposed installment rate. Your support will enable me to improve my work efficiency and provide better for my family. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Mohammed Ahmed
