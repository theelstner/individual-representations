Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the provided profile. First, I need to parse the profile carefully to make sure each letter includes the specific details.

The profile mentions the applicant has a checking account with less than 0 DM, a duration of 12 months, a credit history of paid-back credits, the purpose is radio/television, credit amount 1107, savings under 100 DM, employment for 1-4 years, male single, no debtors, residence for 2 years, property as real estate, age 20, no other installment plans, housing is rent, one existing credit at the bank, job in management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/officer, two dependents, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique. I need to invent specific instances for generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant." Also, the duration should be specific like "8 years" instead of just ">=7 years." The letters should be short, concise, not cut off, and have proper endings. No formatting, so just plain text with line breaks.

First, I need to create five different personas. Let's think of different jobs within the job category: management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, officer. Wait, the profile says "Job:management/ self-employed/ highly qualified employee/ officer." So maybe each letter can focus on one of these roles. Let me check the profile again. The purpose is radio/television, so maybe each person wants to buy different things under that category, like a TV, radio, maybe a sound system, etc.

Let me brainstorm:

1. A self-employed graphic designer. Maybe he needs a new computer with a TV for his work? Wait, the purpose is radio/television. Maybe he wants a TV for his home, but how does that tie into his job? Maybe he uses it for client presentations?

Wait, maybe the purpose is personal, but the applicant's job is professional. So each person is applying for a TV or radio for personal use but needs to explain their financial stability.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They all have real estate as property, so maybe they own a small property. Age 20, which is young, but with real estate? That might be unusual, but maybe they inherited it or bought a small property with family help.

Also, they have two dependents. So maybe they have siblings or a parent they support. Since they're single and male, perhaps they're the primary caregiver.

Let me start drafting the first letter. Let's pick a job: management. Maybe a young manager at a retail store. He needs a TV for home entertainment. He has a stable job, paid back previous credit, and has real estate. He mentions his dependents, maybe parents or siblings. Since he's 20, maybe he's living with family, but the residence is 2 years. Maybe he moved out but still has dependents.

Second letter: self-employed. Maybe a freelancer, like a photographer. Needs a TV for editing or presenting work. Has savings under 100 DM, but has real estate. Maybe inherited property.

Third: highly qualified employee, perhaps in IT. Needs a TV for home. Has been in job for 2 years. Lives in rented housing, but owns real estate elsewhere.

Fourth: officer, maybe in the government. Needs a TV. Stable job, dependents.

Fifth: maybe a small business owner, using the TV for business purposes? Or personal. But the purpose is radio/television, so personal.

Each letter must include the specific numbers: credit amount 1107, installment rate 2, existing credit paid back, etc. Also, they all have a telephone and are registered foreign workers.

Need to make sure each letter is distinct in their reasons and personal circumstances. Let me check the example given in the profile. The user provided an example where a scientific research assistant with 8 years of experience. Wait, the profile says present employment since 1 <= ... <4 years. So each applicant has been in their current job between 1 to 4 years. So in the letters, I need to specify employment duration within that range, like 2 years, 3 years, etc.

Also, the age is 20, which is quite young for some roles. Maybe they are young entrepreneurs or inherited a position. Maybe they are in family businesses.

Let me start drafting each letter one by one, ensuring they all fit the profile and have unique scenarios.

**Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

My name is Luca Moretti, and I am a 20-year-old self-employed web developer residing in Munich. I have been running my freelance business for 2.5 years, creating websites for local businesses. I am applying for a loan of 1107 DM to purchase a high-quality television to enhance my home office setup, which is essential for client presentations and video conferences.  

Although my current checking account balance is negative due to recent software investments, I have consistently repaid my existing bank credit for a sound system over the past 12 months. I own a small apartment in my family’s name (real estate) and have lived at my current address for two years. My monthly income covers a 2 DM installment rate comfortably, and I have two dependents—my younger sister and mother—who rely on my earnings. As a registered foreign worker with a stable job and a telephone for business communication, I assure you of my reliability.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing this further.  

Sincerely,  
Luca Moretti

**Letter 2**  
Dear Bank Manager,  

I am Marco Chen, 20, a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute for Environmental Studies. I have worked there for 3 years, earning a steady income. I seek a 1107 DM loan to buy a television for my apartment, as I frequently host colleagues for collaborative brainstorming sessions.  

My current checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to lab equipment purchases, but I have no other debts besides a fully repaid student loan. I own a inherited villa in Hamburg (real estate) and rent a smaller residence here for 2 years. With two dependents—my father and a cousin—I prioritize financial responsibility. My job guarantees monthly payments, allowing me to manage a 2 DM installment. As a registered foreign worker with a telephone, I value transparency and trust.  

Please consider my application. I am committed to timely repayments.  

Best regards,  
Marco Chen

**Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am Elias Müller, a 20-year-old project officer at a non-profit organization in Frankfurt. Employed for 18 months, I coordinate community outreach programs. I request 1107 DM to purchase a television for my home, which I use to stream educational content for my dependents—a younger brother and uncle.  

Despite a temporary negative balance in my account, I have no overdue payments on my existing bank credit for a laptop. I own a family plot of land (real estate) and reside in a rented flat for 2 years. My 2 DM monthly installment aligns with my salary, and as a registered foreign worker, I maintain a telephone for professional communication. My job’s stability and proactive savings habits (though currently under 100 DM) reflect my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your time. I am eager to discuss my repayment plan.  

Respectfully,  
Elias Müller

Dear Bank Officer,  

My name is Rajesh Patel, 20, a junior officer at the Hamburg Port Authority. With 2 years of service, I oversee cargo documentation. I apply for a 1107 DM loan to buy a television for my rented apartment, where I entertain guests during cultural events I organize.  

My checking account is currently overdrawn due to emergency repairs on my family’s real estate in Mumbai. I have no other debts and have fully repaid a prior bank credit. Supporting two dependents—my grandmother and a cousin—I manage my finances meticulously. My 2 DM installment is feasible with my salary, and as a registered foreign worker, I ensure all communications via telephone are prompt.  

I assure you of my commitment to repayment. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Rajesh Patel

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am Jonas Kim, a 20-year-old management trainee at a logistics company in Cologne. Employed for 11 months, I oversee warehouse operations. I need a 1107 DM loan to purchase a television for my residence, which I use to stay updated on industry news.  

My account balance is temporarily negative due to a recent vehicle registration fee. I own a family-owned vineyard (real estate) in France and have no other debts. With two dependents—my mother and younger brother—I budget carefully to meet my 2 DM installment. As a registered foreign worker with a telephone, I prioritize reliability. My employer’s stability and my repayment history for a previous bank credit demonstrate my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your time. I am ready to provide further details.  

Kind regards,  
Jonas Kim
