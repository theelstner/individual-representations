Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. First, I need to parse the profile carefully. 

The profile includes specific details: no checking account, 12 months of something (probably duration of current residence?), credit history with critical accounts and existing credits elsewhere, business purpose, loan amount 1264, no savings account. Employment for >=7 years, installment rate 4, male single, no debtors, residence since 4 years, no property, age 57, no other installment plans, renting, one existing credit at the bank, job is unskilled-resident, one dependent, no phone, foreign worker.

First, I need to make sure each letter uses specific instances instead of generic terms. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant." Also, each person's situation must fit the profile but vary in their specific scenarios. 

Let me break down the profile into key points that each letter must include: applying for a business loan (specific business ideas), financial situation (existing credits elsewhere, no checking account, savings), employment for at least 7 years in an unskilled job (but need to think of specific unskilled jobs), living in current residence for 4 years, age 57, single with one dependent, renting, foreign worker, no phone. 

Each letter should explain why they need the loan (business purpose), their stability (employment duration, residence), and trustworthiness despite critical credit history. Need to address the bank's concerns about credit history and lack of savings. Maybe they can mention a co-signer? But the profile says no debtors or guarantors. Hmm. So they have to rely on their employment history and existing credit at the bank.

Possible business ideas: small retail, food cart, repair services, home-based services, etc. Each letter can have a different business angle. 

For each person, invent a name, a specific job (unskilled), a specific business idea, and explain how the loan will help. Also, address why they are trustworthy despite the critical credit history. Maybe they have been working steadily, paying other debts, or have a plan to manage the new loan.

Need to make sure each letter is concise, not too long. Start with addressing the bank, introduce themselves, state the purpose, explain their situation, why they need the loan, their ability to repay, and a polite closing. Avoid any formatting, just plain text.

Let me think of five different unskilled jobs. Maybe construction worker, cleaner, delivery driver, security guard, and something else. Each with a different business idea. For example, a cleaner might want to start a small laundry service. A delivery driver could start a courier service. A security guard might want to open a small convenience store near his post. Construction worker could need tools for a side business. Another could be a street vendor.

Also, need to mention the existing credit at the bank. Maybe they have a small existing loan that they're managing, showing they can handle credit. Since their credit history is critical, they might need to explain that past issues are resolved or they have a plan.

Each letter should be unique but adhere to the profile. Let me outline each one:

1. Construction worker (unskilled) applying for a loan to buy tools for a side business as an independent contractor. Has been working in construction for 8 years, living in current residence for 4 years. Existing credit is a small personal loan. Emphasize steady income and how the loan will increase earning potential.

2. Cleaner wanting to start a small laundry service. Has been cleaning in a hotel for 7 years. Existing credit is a car loan. Shows responsibility by making payments. Loan to buy a washing machine and dryer. Stable job and residence.

3. Delivery driver starting a courier service. Worked as a delivery driver for a logistics company for 9 years. Needs a motorcycle. Existing credit is a motorcycle loan. Emphasize regular income and how the business will grow.

4. Security guard opening a convenience store near his post. Worked as security for 7 years. Loan for inventory and setup. Existing credit is a secured loan. Shows commitment to repay.

5. Street food vendor selling traditional dishes. Worked as a kitchen hand for 8 years. Loan for a food cart. Existing credit is a bank credit card. Highlights steady job and community support.

Each letter needs to address the critical credit history. Maybe they mention that past financial difficulties have been overcome, and they are now in a stable position. Since they have an existing credit at the bank, they can mention that they have a good relationship and are managing that credit responsibly.

Also, since they don't have a checking account, maybe they receive payments directly or through cash, but need the loan to formalize their business and start building credit. Or perhaps they use the bank's services in another way.

Make sure each letter is personalized, uses specific numbers (like 8 years of employment), and explains the business purpose clearly. Avoid generic statements. Check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter without repeating the same scenarios.

Dear Bank Official  
As a delivery driver for a logistics company for nine years I have applied for a 1264 loan to purchase a motorcycle for my own courier service. I am 57 years old and have resided in my current rented home for four years.
