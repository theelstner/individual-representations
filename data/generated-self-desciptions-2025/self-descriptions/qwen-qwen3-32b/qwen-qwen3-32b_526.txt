Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the details.

First, the existing checking account has a balance between 0 and 200 DM, and the account has been open for 18 months. The credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose of the loan is for radio/television. The credit amount is 1113 DM. Savings account/bonds are less than 100 DM. Present employment since 1 to 4 years. Personal status is female, divorced/separated/married. Other debtors/guarantors: guarantor. Present residence since 4 years. Property: real estate. Age: 26. No other installment plans. Housing: own. Number of existing credits at this bank: 1. Job: unskilled - resident. Dependents: 2. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So each letter needs to reflect these specifics. Let me think of different scenarios where a foreign worker, female, with dependents, etc., would need a loan for radio/television. Since the purpose is generic, maybe each person can have a slightly different angle on why they need the loan. For example, educational purposes, family entertainment, professional development, etc.

Let me start with the first person. Let's say she's a scientific research assistant. Wait, the job is unskilled-resident. Hmm, maybe that's a problem. Wait, the job in the profile is "unskilled - resident". So I need to adjust that. Maybe she's a factory worker or something unskilled. Let me check the original profile again. The job is unskilled-resident. So the person is an unskilled worker residing in the country. So maybe she's a cleaner, a factory worker, or similar.

Also, the person is a foreign worker, yes. So she's from another country, working there. Let me create different roles. Maybe a factory worker, a cleaner, a warehouse worker, a domestic helper, etc. Each with different specifics.

First letter: Let's say she's a warehouse worker. She's been employed for 2 years. Her checking account is 150 DM. Savings less than 100 DM. She has two dependents. She needs the TV for her children's education, maybe. She has a guarantor. She's been living in her own home for 4 years. She's a foreign worker from, say, Poland, working in Germany. She's paid back previous loans. She can mention her stable job and guarantor.

Second letter: Maybe a cleaner in a hospital. Employed for 3 years. Checking account 100 DM. Needs TV for family entertainment. Guarantor is her sister. She's been in the country for 4 years, has real estate (maybe inherited?), and has two kids. She's a trustworthy candidate because of her stable job and timely payments.

Third letter: A domestic helper. Employed for 1 year. Checking account 50 DM. Needs a radio for language learning. Guarantor is her employer. She's 26, has dependents, and wants to improve her language skills to get a better job. Shows initiative and responsibility.

Fourth letter: A factory worker. Employed for 3 years. Checking account 200 DM. Needs TV for her children to have access to educational programs. Guarantor is her mother. She has a stable job and has always repaid loans on time.

Fifth letter: A part-time worker in a retail store. Employed for 2 years. Checking account 80 DM. Needs a radio for her kids to listen to educational content. Guarantor is her brother. She emphasizes her commitment to repaying the loan and her stable residence.

I need to make sure each letter is unique in the reason for the loan, the job, and the guarantor. Also, each should mention the specific numbers from the profile: 18 months checking account, 4 years residence, 1 existing credit, etc. Also, mention that she's a foreign worker, female, with dependents, no telephone, etc.

Let me start drafting the first letter. Make sure to keep it concise, no formatting, proper ending. Each letter should start with the applicant's name, address, date, bank address, then the body explaining the purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Then a closing.

Let me check the first example. The user provided an example response with letters. Let me make sure to follow that structure but with different specifics.

First letter: Maria Kowalski, foreign worker from Poland, warehouse worker, 2 years employed, checking account 150 DM, savings 50 DM. Guarantor is her sister. Needs TV for children's education. Has real estate as property. Existing credit paid back. Emphasize stability and guarantor.

Second letter: Maybe Aisha Mohammed, Egyptian cleaner in hospital, 3 years employed, checking 100 DM, savings 80 DM. Guarantor is her sister. Needs TV for family. Stable job and residence.

Third: Maybe Li Na, domestic helper from China, 1 year employed, checking 50 DM, savings 30 DM. Guarantor is employer. Needs radio for language learning. Shows initiative for better job.

Fourth: Elena Garcia, factory worker from Spain, 3 years employed, checking 200 DM, savings 90 DM. Guarantor is mother. TV for educational programs for kids.

Fifth: Fatima Ahmed, retail worker from Nigeria, 2 years employed, checking 80 DM, savings 40 DM. Guarantor is brother. Radio for kids' education.

Each letter should mention the purpose, financial situation (checking, savings, employment duration), credit history, guarantor, property, dependents, and why trustworthy.

I need to ensure that all the profile attributes are covered in each letter. Let me check each attribute:

- Checking account: 0-200 DM, duration 18 months. Each letter should mention the checking account balance and 18 months.

- Credit history: existing credits paid back.

- Purpose: radio/TV. Each has a specific reason.

- Credit amount: 1113 DM. Mention the exact amount.

- Savings <100 DM.

- Employment since 1-4 years.

- Female, divorced/separated/married.

- Guarantor.

- Residence since 4 years.

- Property: real estate.

- Age 26.

- No other installment plans.

- Own housing.

- 1 existing credit at the bank.

- Unskilled job.

- 2 dependents.

- No telephone.

- Foreign worker.

Each letter must include these points, but in a natural way. For example, mentioning that she has a guarantor, has real estate, has dependents, etc.

Now, writing each letter with these specifics. Let me draft the first one.

First letter:

[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Date]

[Bank Name]
[Bank Address]

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Maria Kowalski, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1113 DM to purchase a television for my family. As a warehouse worker employed for the past two years, I have a stable income and a strong commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations. I currently hold a checking account with your bank for 18 months, with a balance of 150 DM, and my savings amount to 80 DM. 

I have always paid back my previous credits on time, including the existing credit I hold with your bank. My sister acts as a guarantor for this loan, and I reside in my own home, which I have owned for the past four years. As a foreign worker from Poland, I have two dependents and prioritize their well-being, which is why a television would provide educational content for my children. 

I assure you of my reliability and punctuality in repaying this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Maria Kowalski

That seems to cover most points. Let me check for the other letters, varying the details. Each letter should have different job, guarantor, reason for loan, etc.

Second letter: Aisha Mohammed, cleaner in hospital, 3 years employed, checking 100 DM, savings 80 DM, guarantor sister, TV for family entertainment.

Third: Li Na, domestic helper, 1 year employed, checking 50 DM, savings 30 DM, guarantor employer, radio for language learning.

Fourth: Elena Garcia, factory worker, 3 years, checking 200 DM, savings 90 DM, guarantor mother, TV for kids' education.

Fifth: Fatima Ahmed, retail worker, 2 years, checking 80 DM, savings 40 DM, guarantor brother, radio for kids' learning.

Each of these should be structured similarly but with unique details. Need to make sure all profile attributes are included. Also, mention the existing credit, credit history, residence duration, property, etc.

I think this approach will work. Now, I need to write all five letters following this structure, ensuring each is unique and includes all required details.
