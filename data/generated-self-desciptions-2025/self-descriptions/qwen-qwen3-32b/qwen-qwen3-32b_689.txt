Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

First, the profile details: The person has a checking account with less than 200 DM, has had it for 36 months. They have a credit history with past delays in payments. The loan purpose is a new car, amount 2862 DM. Savings account between 100-500 DM. Employed for at least 7 years. Installment rate 4. Single male, no other debtors or guarantors. Residence for 3 years. No property. Age 30. No other installment plans. Housing is free. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. One dependent. No telephone. Foreign worker.

So, for each letter, I need to invent specific instances. Let's break down the generic attributes:

- Skilled employee/official: Maybe jobs like electrician, mechanic, teacher, etc.
- Credit history with delay: Need to explain past issues but show improvement.
- Purpose: Car for work, family needs, etc.
- Savings: Specific amounts between 100-500 DM.
- Employment duration: At least 7 years, maybe 8, 9, 7.5, etc.
- Residence: 3 years, maybe in different cities or countries.
- Dependents: One child, spouse, etc. But personal status is single, so maybe a child from a previous relationship or dependent parent.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They need to address past credit issues, showing they've learned from mistakes. Also, mention current stability, savings, employment, etc.

Let me start with the first person. Let's pick a job: scientific research assistant. Maybe from the profile's example. They have 8 years of employment. Let's say they work at a university. Their savings are 300 DM. They need a car for commuting. They mention past delays due to medical emergencies but have been responsible since. They have a dependent child.

Second person: Electrician with 7 years at a construction company. Savings 200 DM. Needs a car for job site travel. Past delay due to unexpected repairs. Lives in the same residence for 3 years, has a dependent parent.

Third person: Public official, maybe a teacher. 9 years in job. Savings 400 DM. Needs a car for transporting dependent sibling. Past delay due to car repair costs. Now more budgeting.

Fourth person: IT technician, 7.5 years at a company. Savings 150 DM. Car for work-related travel. Past delay due to family emergency. Lives with sibling, housing free. One child.

Fifth person: Social worker, 10 years employed. Savings 500 DM. Car for visiting clients. Past delay due to previous job transition. Now stable, one child.

Each letter should start with sender's info, date, bank address, subject. Then body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. End with thanks and signature.

Need to ensure each letter is unique in specifics but fits the profile. Also, avoid formatting, just plain text. Keep them concise, not too long. Make sure to mention the exact credit amount, duration, etc., as per the profile.

Check that each letter addresses the past credit issues but shows improvement. Highlight current employment stability, savings, existing credit with the bank. Maybe mention willingness to provide additional documentation if needed. Emphasize ability to make installments with the given rate.

Now, draft each letter step by step, ensuring all specific details are included without repetition.

Subject: Application for Car Loan – 2,862 DM  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,862 DM to purchase a reliable vehicle for my daily commute as a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin.

I reside in my current apartment for 3 years and have no other debts. As a foreign worker, I prioritize responsibility, especially in supporting my 6-year-old daughter. I am confident in my ability to manage the 4% installment rate and request your consideration. Thank you for your time.

Subject: Application for Vehicle Financing  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a 2,862 DM loan to acquire a vehicle for transporting my younger sibling, who relies on me for school and work. As a public school teacher with 9 years of experience, I earn 2,100 DM monthly and contribute 400 DM to savings each month. My checking account, active for 36 months, and my one existing credit with your bank demonstrate my financial responsibility.  

A past payment delay stemmed from covering urgent car repair costs, but I have since adjusted my budget to allocate funds for such emergencies. I reside in my current home for 3 years and am committed to repaying this loan through my stable income. My dependent sibling and I value reliability, and I assure you of timely installments. I appreciate your consideration.  

Respectfully,
