Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter must come from a different person with specific details. Let me start by understanding the profile thoroughly.

The profile has several key points. The person has a checking account with less than 200 DM, has had it for 48 months. Their credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is "others," and the amount is 5381 DM. They don't have a savings account. They're unemployed, have been in their current residence for 4 years, no property, 40 years old, have other installment plans with the bank, housing is for free, one dependent, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

First, I need to create five different scenarios where each person's situation fits the profile but has unique reasons for the loan. Let me brainstorm possible purposes since the profile says "others." Maybe starting a small business, medical expenses, education, family emergency, or home repairs. Each person's story should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy.

Let me think about each person:

1. **Small Business Startup**: Maybe a food vendor. They can mention using the loan for equipment, having a steady customer base, and repayment plan.

2. **Medical Expenses**: Someone needing surgery. They can explain the necessity, how they'll manage payments despite unemployment, maybe using future income from a new job.

3. **Vocational Training**: To gain skills for employment. The loan covers course fees, leading to a stable job for repayments.

4. **Family Emergency**: Helping a relative, perhaps a sister's education. They can show commitment to repayment through part-time work.

5. **Home Renovation**: Fixing a roof to avoid further costs. They might mention a part-time job or freelance work to cover installments.

Each letter needs specific details. For example, instead of "unemployed," maybe "freelance graphic designer with inconsistent income." But wait, the profile says "unemployed/ unskilled - non-resident." So maybe they are registered as foreign workers but not in skilled jobs. So perhaps they have some informal work or are looking to upskill.

Let me check each attribute again to make sure I don't miss anything. The person is male, single, 40, 1 dependent, 4 years at residence, no property, unemployed, but has a telephone and is a registered foreign worker. Credit history is good, existing credit paid back. The loan amount is 5381 DM, installment rate 3.

Each letter must be concise, not cut off, and have a proper ending. Avoid formatting. Use specific instances like "scientific research assistant" as an example. So replace generic terms with specifics.

For each letter, start with the person's name, address, date, bank address. Then the body explaining their situation, purpose, financial status, and trustworthiness. Conclude with gratitude and willingness to provide more info.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring each has unique scenarios but fits the profile. Need to make sure that the purpose is "others" as per the profile. Also, since they're unemployed, they need to show a plan to repay. Maybe part-time jobs, future income streams, or collateral (though they have no property). They can mention their good credit history and existing installment plans with the bank as a positive factor.

Also, the profile mentions "other installment plans: bank," so maybe they already have a loan with the same bank, which shows reliability.

Let me start writing each letter with these points in mind.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Mr. Ahmed Khan  
123 Maple Street  
Berlin, Germany

To the Loan Committee of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to request a loan of 5,381 DM to fund my plan to establish a small street food cart specializing in traditional Indian cuisine. As a registered foreign worker in Germany for the past five years, I have saved diligently despite having no formal savings account. My unemployment status is temporary—I completed a culinary certification course in June and have secured a vendor permit for a local market. I will repay the loan through daily sales, with a projected monthly income of 1,200 DM. I have already repaid a prior bank loan for kitchen equipment, demonstrating my reliability. My sister, my sole dependent, resides with me, and we carefully manage expenses. I assure you of timely repayments and am prepared to provide market contracts as proof of income.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 5,381 DM loan to cover urgent medical treatments for my chronic back condition, which has limited my ability to work since my factory job ended last year. Though unemployed, I have been self-employed as a freelance carpenter for short-term projects, earning approximately 800 DM monthly. My medical bills total 6,500 DM, and this loan will cover the remaining amount after using my meager savings. I have a four-year rental agreement and a strong credit history, having repaid a previous bank loan for tools. My dependent child is in school, and I prioritize financial responsibility. I will repay the loan through my carpentry income and a part-time delivery job I’ve started.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Luis Ortega

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Mr. Dmitry Petrov  
789 Oak Road  
Hamburg, Germany

To Whom It May Concern,  

I am applying for a 5,381 DM loan to enroll in a vocational training program in automotive repair, which I believe will secure stable employment. Having worked as an unskilled laborer in construction for eight years, I now aim to transition into a skilled trade. My unemployment benefits cover basic needs, but the 8,000 DM course fee requires additional funds. I have already saved 2,000 DM from odd jobs and will contribute this toward the loan. My previous loan for a mobile phone (repaid in full) shows my commitment. Upon completing the program in March 2024, I anticipate earning 2,500 DM monthly, allowing me to repay installments. I live with my son, and we maintain a frugal lifestyle.  

Gratefully,  
Dmitry Petrov

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Mr. Carlos Mendes  
101 Pine Lane  
Frankfurt, Germany

Dear Loan Committee,  

The 5,381 DM loan I request will help my younger sister pursue a nursing degree in Lisbon, Portugal. As her legal guardian since her parents’ passing, I am committed to her future. Though unemployed in Germany, I have earned 400–600 DM monthly through online graphic design work since 2021. My four-year rental contract and clean credit history (including repaying a 2,000 DM bank loan) attest to my stability. Her university has confirmed a scholarship covering 50% of tuition, but I need this loan for the remainder. I will repay the loan from my freelance income and a part-time warehouse job starting next month. My gratitude for your trust in me is immeasurable.  

Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendes

**Motivation Letter 5**  
Mr. Rajesh Kumar

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

I need a 5,381 DM loan to repair my apartment’s leaking roof, which has caused 3,000 DM in furniture damage. Living in this residence for four years, I have no property but have consistently paid rent and utility bills. As an unemployed former warehouse worker, I now earn 500 DM monthly from tutoring in English. My existing loan for a bicycle (repaid fully) reflects my discipline. I have secured a quote from a contractor for 7,000 DM, and this loan will cover the cost incrementally. I will repay the loan from tutoring income and a new gig as a warehouse part-timer. My dependent mother-in-law and I live modestly, prioritizing savings for emergencies.  

With appreciation,  
Rajesh Kumar
