Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile mentions that the person is a foreign worker, male, single, 26 years old, has been in their current job for at least 7 years, and has two existing credits at the bank. They don't have a checking account, have a critical credit history, and their purpose for the loan is radio/television. The loan amount is 1934 DM, and they have savings less than 100 DM. They live in their own housing, have dependents (1), and no telephone. They've been in their current residence for 2 years.

I need to create five different people with specific instances. Let's think of different job roles under "skilled employee / official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a teacher, a nurse, and an IT technician. Each should have a unique reason for needing the loan related to radio/television. Maybe they need equipment for work, a TV for their child's education, a radio for a community project, etc.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their stable job, duration, existing credits, and how they'll repay. Also, address the critical credit history by showing responsibility.

Let me start with the first one. The scientific research assistant. Maybe he needs a radio for fieldwork. He's been working at a university for 8 years. Has two existing credits for lab equipment. He's living with his sister, has a dependent child. Emphasize his stable income and repayment plan.

Second, a mechanic. Maybe he wants a TV for his workshop to show customers how repairs work. He's been at the same garage for 7 years, has two car loans. Lives in his own apartment. Highlight his steady income and savings plan.

Third, a teacher. Needs a TV for classroom materials. Works at a school for 9 years, two existing credits for books. Lives with family, no checking account but manages savings. Emphasize his stable job and educational purpose.

Fourth, a nurse. Wants a radio for night shifts to stay updated. Works in a clinic, two credits for medical supplies. Lives in own housing, has a child. Stress her reliable income and repayment ability.

Fifth, IT technician. Needs a TV for online courses. Employed at a tech firm for 7 years, two credits for software. Lives with partner, critical credit history but improved. Highlight his technical skills and future earnings.

Each letter should be concise, start with their name, address the bank, explain purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and end politely. Avoid formatting, just plain text. Make sure each has specific numbers and roles as per the profile. Check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are distinct and meet the requirements.

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Ahmed Al-Mansoori, and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Duisburg-Essen, where I have worked for 8 years. I am applying for a loan of 1934 DM to purchase a weather radio for fieldwork, as my current equipment is outdated and essential for data collection. I have two existing credits at your bank for lab supplies, both repaid on time over the past 12 months. Though I do not currently hold a checking account, I manage my salary through a savings account with 80 DM, and I reside in my own apartment in Duisburg, where I have lived for 2 years. As a foreign worker from Oman, I support my 5-year-old daughter financially and prioritize timely payments. I assure you my stable income of 2800 DM monthly, combined with my commitment to repaying installments of 2 DM weekly, makes me a reliable candidate. I kindly request your approval to continue advancing my research.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Al-Mansoori
