Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says the person is a foreign worker, male, single, 32 years old, has been in their current job for 4-7 years, has a savings account under 100 DM, no checking account, credit history with existing credits paid back, purpose is radio/television, credit amount 1552, installment rate 3, housing is own, dependents 2, etc.

I need to create five different people. Let me brainstorm different job roles. The profile mentions "skilled employee / official," so maybe I can have a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a nurse, an IT technician, and a teacher. Each should have unique names and specific job titles.

For each person, I need to explain why they're applying for the loan. The purpose is radio/television, but maybe they can have specific reasons like a home business, educational needs, family communication, etc. They need to mention their financial situation: stable job, current savings, existing credit paid back, no checking account but have a savings account. They should emphasize trustworthiness by highlighting their punctual payments, stable residence (though only 1 year in current residence, which might be a point to address), and employment.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, starts with their personal details, explains the purpose, financial status, and why they're trustworthy. Avoid formatting, just plain text with proper endings. Let me start drafting each one step by step.

First person: Scientific Research Assistant. Let's say he needs the TV for keeping up with research. Mention his job at a university, 6 years in current role. He has a small savings, no checking account but manages through his savings. Emphasize punctual payments of existing credit. Dependents: wife and child. Housing in own home. Maybe mention that he's a foreign worker on a work visa, which shows stability.

Second person: Auto Mechanic. Needs TV for a small workshop to show tutorials. Has been working at a garage for 5 years. Maybe mention that he's a foreign worker who came for employment opportunities. Savings are low but managed to save some. Existing credit for tools paid back. Dependents: two young children. Owns a car as property.

Third person: Nurse. Needs TV for language courses to improve German. Working in a clinic, 5 years employed. Savings from part-time work. Trustworthy because of timely payments. Lives in own housing, has a car. Two dependents. Maybe mention that she's a foreign worker who moved for better healthcare opportunities.

Fourth person: IT Technician. Needs TV for home office setup. Worked at a tech company for 6 years. Savings account with some money. No checking account but manages through direct deposits. Existing credit for software licenses. Dependents: two. Owns a car. Trustworthy by paying installments on time.

Fifth person: Secondary School Teacher. Needs TV for educational resources. Worked at a school for 5 years. Savings from teaching. Existing credit for books. Trustworthy payments. Owns home. Two children. Foreign worker in education sector.

I need to ensure each letter has specific numbers and roles. Also, check the profile details: present residence since 1 year. Maybe mention that they've recently moved but have stable employment. Also, no telephone, so maybe they prefer in-person or written communication.

Each letter should start with the person's name, address, date, bank address. Then a subject line. Then the body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. End with thanks and signature.

Let me check each profile against the original to make sure all attributes are covered. For example, each has 2 dependents, foreign worker, current job between 4-7 years, savings <100 DM, etc. Also, the purpose is radio/TV but each has a unique angle. Each mentions existing credit paid back, no checking account, savings account, etc.

Now, write each letter step by step, ensuring they are distinct and meet all criteria.
