Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the details.

First, the profile has specific attributes: checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM, duration of 9 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is for radio/television. Credit amount is 2118 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Employment duration 1-4 years. Single male, no other debtors, residence since 2 years, property is real estate, age 37, own housing, one existing credit at the bank, job is unskilled resident, two dependents, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

For each letter, I need to create a unique person. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different nationalities, jobs, reasons for the loan. Let me start with the first one. The job is unskilled resident, so maybe a construction worker? Let me name him. Maybe from a different country, like Mexico. He's living in Germany. He wants to buy a TV for his family. He has a steady job, paid back previous loans, has a small savings. His wife and child are dependents. He's been in his job for 3 years, residence for 2 years. He owns real estate, maybe a small property. That fits.

Second person: Maybe a different unskilled job, like warehouse worker. From the Philippines. Maybe he wants a radio for his business? Or maybe a TV. Wait, the purpose is radio/television. Maybe he uses the radio for his work? Or to stay connected. Let me think. He's a warehouse worker, has been employed for 2 years, lives in own housing. Maybe he's using the loan to buy a TV for his family. His savings are low, but he's responsible with previous credit. He's a foreign worker, single, two dependents.

Third person: Maybe a cleaner, from Eastern Europe, say Romania. She's been in her job for 1 year. She wants to buy a TV for her family. She's a single mother with two kids. She's been living in her residence for 2 years, has real estate. Maybe she emphasizes her stable job and timely payments.

Fourth person: Maybe a different angle. Perhaps he uses the loan for a radio for his work. If he's an unskilled worker, maybe a delivery person who needs a radio for communication. But the profile says purpose is radio/television. Maybe he's using it for a small business, like a radio to coordinate deliveries. Let me create a character, maybe from India, working as a delivery helper. He's been in Germany for 2 years, has a stable job, and needs a radio for work efficiency.

Fifth person: Another unskilled worker, maybe in agriculture or maintenance. Let's say from Colombia, working as a maintenance worker. He wants to buy a TV for his family. He has a small savings, has paid back previous loans, and has a residence of 2 years. He's a single father with two children.

I need to make sure each letter has specific details: name, job, duration, savings, purpose, dependents, etc. Each should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation (checking account, savings), and why they are trustworthy (credit history, employment, residence). Also, mention they have a real estate as property, own housing, no other debts, and telephone is none. Each letter should be concise, not too long, with proper endings.

Let me check the example. The user provided an example response with five letters. Each starts with the person's name and address, then the bank's address. The body explains their situation. I need to follow that structure. Make sure not to use any formatting, just plain text with line breaks.

Wait, the user said not to use any formatting, so no bold or italics. Each letter should be written in plain text. Also, the purpose is radio/television, so each person should have a specific reason related to that. Maybe some for family, others for work-related purposes. Let me ensure that each letter is unique in their reasoning but fits the profile. Also, the credit amount is 2118 DM, so they need to mention that amount. Each person's financial situation should reflect the profile: checking account between 0-200, savings <100, employment 1-4 years, etc.

I need to avoid generic terms. Instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs like "construction worker," "warehouse operative," etc. Each letter should have a unique name, nationality, job, and specific instance of why they need the loan. Also, mention their dependents, residence duration, and that they have real estate. Make sure they are trustworthy by mentioning they paid back previous credits, have a steady job, etc.

Let me start drafting each letter one by one, ensuring all the points are covered and each is distinct.

Mr. Juan Morales  
Calle 123, Apartment 4B  
Berlin, Germany  

Dear [Bank Name],  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2118 DM to purchase a television for my family. As an unskilled construction worker employed at a local building site for the past 3 years, I earn a stable monthly income of 1800 DM. My current checking account holds 150 DM, and I maintain a small savings account of 80 DM. I have resided in my apartment for 2 years and own a modest real estate property in my hometown of Mexico.  

I have consistently repaid my previous credit for tools, which I took from this bank 6 months ago. My employer has confirmed my job stability, and I have no other debts or installment plans. As a foreign worker from Mexico, I support two dependents: my 8-year-old son and my elderly mother. While I currently lack a telephone, I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations, as evidenced by my punctual payments to date. I kindly request your approval to enhance my family’s quality of life.  

Sincerely,
