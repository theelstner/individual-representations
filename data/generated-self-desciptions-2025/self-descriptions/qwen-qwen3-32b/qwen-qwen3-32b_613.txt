Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on a specific profile. First, I need to parse the profile details carefully.

The profile includes specific attributes like a checking account with at least 200 DM, salary assignments for a year, duration of 10 months, credit history of paid-back credits, purpose is a new car, credit amount 1240 DM, savings between 100-500 DM, employment for over 7 years, installment rate 1, female, divorced/separated/married, no other debtors, residence since 4 years, no property, age 48, no other installment plans, housing for free, one existing credit at the bank, job as unskilled resident, two dependents, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

So each letter needs to be from a different person, with specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant." The user wants specific job roles, exact numbers like 8 years instead of >=7, etc. The letters should be short, concise, not cut off, proper ending, no formatting.

First, I need to create five different personas. Each must fit the profile but with unique details. Let's think of different jobs that fit "unskilled - resident." Maybe cleaner, factory worker, caregiver, etc. Also, different reasons for the car purchase: maybe for work commute, transporting dependents, starting a small business, etc.

Each letter should explain the purpose, financial situation (checking account, savings, employment duration), credit history, and trustworthiness. Need to make sure each letter has unique specifics but still aligns with the profile.

Let me start with the first person. Maybe a cleaner with 8 years at a hospital. She needs a car to commute longer distances. She has a savings account with 300 DM. She's a foreign worker, married with two children. She mentions her existing credit for furniture, paid back, and asks for the car loan.

Second person: factory worker. Let's say 7 years at a car factory. Needs a reliable car for work and kids. Savings 450 DM. Divorced, two dependents. Emphasize stable income and timely payments.

Third: caregiver. Works 8 years, needs a car for client visits. Maybe she's separated, lives in a free housing, has savings 200 DM. Highlight her job stability and current credit history.

Fourth: a woman who is a factory worker, maybe 9 years, needs a car to start a small business, like selling food. She's married, two kids, savings 100 DM. She mentions her existing credit and ability to manage payments.

Fifth: maybe a cleaner at a school, 7 years, needs a car for transporting children. She's divorced, has two dependents, savings 350 DM. Emphasize her long-term residence and employment.

Each letter must include all the required elements: checking account status, duration, credit history, purpose, amount, savings, employment duration, personal status, residence, age, job, dependents, foreign worker. Make sure to vary the specifics each time. Avoid repetition in job roles and reasons for the loan. Also, ensure each letter has a proper closing, no formatting, and is concise. Check that all numbers from the profile are correctly represented, like age 48, credit amount 1240 DM, etc. Also, mention the installment rate of 1, which might mean 1% or 1 DM, but since it's in DM, maybe 1% monthly? Not sure, but perhaps just mention the installment rate as part of their financial plan.

Need to make sure each letter is unique but still fits the profile. Let me start drafting each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered and specifics are invented as per the profile.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Maria Alvarez, and I am a factory worker at a textile plant in Frankfurt, where I have been employed for 8 years. I am writing to request a loan of 1240 DM to purchase a reliable car for commuting and transporting my two children, as public transport is inconsistent in my area. I currently hold a checking account with a minimum balance of 200 DM and have maintained it for over a year. My salary is consistently deposited there, and I have no late payments to report. I also have a savings account with 450 DM, which I have built through careful budgeting. I am divorced, 48 years old, and have lived in my current residence for 4 years. I have already repaid a previous loan from this bank for household furniture, and I am committed to fulfilling this new installment plan. My stable income and responsible financial habits make me a trustworthy candidate. I would be grateful for your support.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Alvarez
