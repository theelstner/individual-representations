Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account with at least 200 DM and salary assignments for at least a year. The duration is 12 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is radio/television, credit amount 1297 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Present employment since 1 to 4 years. Installment rate 3. Male, married or widowed. No other debtors/guarantors. Residence since 4 years. Property is real estate. Age 23. No other installment plans. Housing is rent. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So each person should have these attributes. Let me think of different scenarios. Let me pick different jobs first. The profile says "skilled employee / official". So maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, teacher, nurse, or a civil servant like a tax officer. Let me check the example given in the query: "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee". So each job should be specific.

First person: Let's take a scientific research assistant. He's 23, foreign worker, married with one dependent. He's been employed for 2 years, has a real estate property, living in residence for 4 years. His purpose is to buy a TV for his child's education. He has a good credit history, one existing credit paid back. Savings are low because he's saving for a larger purchase. Trustworthy because of steady income and timely payments.

Second person: Electrician. Maybe he's widowed, has a dependent, works as a skilled electrician. He wants a radio for his business to stay updated with codes. Employed for 3 years, living in the same residence. No savings because he's repairing the rental house. Trustworthy due to punctual payments.

Third person: Teacher. Maybe a foreign teacher in a private school, married, needs a TV for language learning. Employed for 2.5 years, has real estate. Savings are low because he's paying for his sister's education. Reliable with credit history.

Fourth person: Nurse. Widowed, single parent, wants a radio for night shifts. Employed for 1.5 years, living in rented housing. Savings are minimal due to child's expenses. Has a good credit history.

Fifth person: Tax officer. Married, wants a TV for home entertainment. Employed for 3 years, owns property. Savings are low because he's paying off a previous loan. Trustworthy with timely payments.

Now, each letter should have specific details. Let me make sure each has unique instances. For example, different jobs, different reasons for the loan (TV or radio), different dependents (child, sister, etc.), different employment durations (2, 3, 2.5, 1.5, 3 years). Also, mention the existing credit, residence duration, property, etc.

Check the structure: Start with address, date, bank address. Then body explaining purpose, financial situation, why trustworthy. Conclude with thanks and willingness to provide more info. No formatting, keep it concise.

Make sure each letter is distinct. Avoid repetition in reasons. Use specific numbers: e.g., 2 years employment, 3 years residence, etc. Also, note that the age is 23, so for the widowed person, maybe it's a recent event, but acceptable.

Let me draft each letter step by step, ensuring all profile attributes are covered and specific instances are included.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Mr. Ahmed Hassan, a 23-year-old foreign worker from Egypt, has been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute for Environmental Studies for 2.5 years. Married with one child, he resides in a rented apartment in Munich, where he has lived for the past four years. Mr. Hassan seeks a loan of 1,297 DM to purchase a television to support his child’s educational development, as his current job requires frequent evening work and he wishes to provide structured learning resources at home. He has maintained a checking account with the bank for 14 months and has consistently repaid his prior credit for laboratory equipment. With a stable salary of 2,400 DM monthly and real estate property in his hometown as collateral, he assures timely repayment of 3 DM installments. His savings account holds 80 DM, which he has allocated for emergency expenses.  

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Mr. Luis Fernandez, a 23-year-old Spanish electrician, has worked at a construction firm in Frankfurt for three years. Widowed, he cares for his 6-year-old daughter and rents a small apartment he has occupied for four years. He applies for the loan to buy a radio for his business, as he frequently travels to job sites and needs real-time updates on electrical safety regulations. Mr. Fernandez has a clean credit history, having repaid a previous loan for tools. His monthly income is 2,100 DM, and he owns a villa in Seville, Spain, valued at 50,000 DM. Though his savings account contains 50 DM due to recent repairs on his rental property, he emphasizes his punctual salary deposits and commitment to repaying the installment plan.  

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Mr. Rajesh Patel, a 23-year-old Indian teacher at a private school in Hamburg, has taught mathematics for two years. Married with one dependent, he resides in a rented flat he has called home since 2019. The loan will fund a television to practice German language skills, aiding his career advancement. Mr. Patel’s existing credit for classroom supplies was repaid in full, and his 2,300 DM monthly salary ensures repayment capacity. He owns a plot of land in Mumbai but has minimal savings (90 DM) due to supporting his sister’s university education in India. His stable employment and property ownership, he argues, make him a low-risk candidate.  

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Mr. Carlos Mendes, a 23-year-old Brazilian nurse in Stuttgart, is widowed and raises his 4-year-old son alone. He has worked at a clinic for 18 months and lives in a rental apartment he has inhabited for four years. The loan will cover a durable radio for his night shifts, ensuring he stays connected to hospital paging systems. Mr. Mendez’s sole existing credit—a medical textbook loan—was repaid without issue. With a 2,000 DM monthly income and a real estate investment in Rio de Janeiro, he pledges to meet 3 DM installments. His savings account, currently at 30 DM, reflects recent expenditures on his son’s healthcare.  

**Motivation Letter 5**  
Mr. Jonas Kim, a 23-year-old South Korean tax officer in Dresden, has worked at the local finance office for three years. Married with one child, he rents a home he has occupied since 2020. The loan will fund a television to replace his outdated device, which he uses for family entertainment and staying informed about international tax policies. Mr. Kim’s prior credit for office software was repaid fully, and his 2,500 DM salary, coupled with real estate in Seoul, guarantees repayment. His savings account holds 40 DM, as he has been saving for his child’s early education. He stresses his disciplined financial habits and long-term employment stability.  

Each applicant highlights their unique circumstances while aligning with the profile’s parameters, emphasizing trustworthiness through property ownership, repayment history, and stable income.
