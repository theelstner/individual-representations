Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the provided profile. First, I need to parse the profile to understand the specifics. The profile includes details like no checking account, 18 months duration, credit history with existing credits paid back, purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 3422 DM, savings under 100 DM, employment for over 7 years, single male, no debtors, residence since 4 years, property as building society savings, age 47, other installment plans with bank, housing in own, 3 existing credits at the bank, job as skilled employee/official, two dependents, telephone yes, foreign worker registered.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I have to create different scenarios for each applicant. Let me start by varying the job roles. The profile says "skilled employee/official," so maybe I can use different professions like scientific research assistant, IT specialist, electrician, teacher, and logistics coordinator. That adds variety.

Next, the purpose is furniture/equipment. I can assign different reasons: home office setup, classroom equipment, workshop tools, medical equipment for a family member, and home renovation. Each purpose should tie into their job or personal situation.

Financial situation: All have similar attributes, but I need to personalize. For example, one might have a stable job with consistent income, another might have recent promotions, another could have a side hustle. They all have existing credits paid back, so emphasizing timely repayments is key. Also, they have savings agreements, so mentioning building society savings or life insurance.

Trustworthiness: Highlighting punctual payments, long-term employment, residence stability, and existing bank relationships. Each letter should mention their 3 existing credits at the bank, showing they're familiar with the bank's processes.

I need to make sure each letter is concise but covers all necessary points. Avoid generic terms by using specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant." Also, check the duration in months (18 months), so maybe mention a specific time frame like 1.5 years.

Check for each letter's unique angle. For example, one applicant might be upgrading home office equipment for a promotion, another might need furniture due to an unexpected situation. Each story should be distinct but fit the profile.

Also, ensure that each letter ends properly, not cut off. Use a polite closing, sign off with the applicant's name, and include contact info if needed. Since they have a telephone, mention that they can be contacted.

Now, let me draft each letter step by step, ensuring all profile attributes are addressed with specific examples. Make sure the loan amount is 3422 DM, mention the installment rate of 4 DM, and the age of 47. Each applicant has two dependents, so maybe mention family responsibilities as motivation to repay.

Avoid any formatting, just plain text with line breaks. Keep each letter short but comprehensive. Let me start with the first one, maybe a scientific research assistant needing furniture for a home office after a promotion. Second, an IT specialist needing equipment for a tech upgrade. Third, an electrician requiring tools for his business. Fourth, a teacher wanting to buy classroom materials. Fifth, a logistics coordinator needing furniture after a family emergency.

Check each letter for the required elements: purpose, financial stability, repayment history, trustworthiness. Make sure each has unique scenarios but fits the profile. Also, ensure that they don't have a checking account but have savings agreements. Mention their residence duration (4 years) and employment duration (>=7 years). Maybe vary the employment duration slightly if allowed, but the profile says >=7 years, so keep it as 7 or more.

Alright, let me put this all together into five distinct letters.
