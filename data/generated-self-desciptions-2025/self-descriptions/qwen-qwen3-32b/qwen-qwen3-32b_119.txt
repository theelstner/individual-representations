Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account with less than 0 DM, which is negative. The duration of the account is 10 months. Credit history is critical, and there are other existing credits not at this bank. The purpose is for furniture or equipment, and the loan amount is 2132 DM. Savings account is unknown or non-existent. Present employment is less than a year. Installment rate is 2 DM. Personal status is female, married, divorced, or separated. There's a co-applicant for debtors/guarantors. Present residence since 3 years. Property is real estate. Age 27. No other installment plans. Housing is rented. Two existing credits at this bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Not a foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique but fit these parameters. Let me think of different scenarios for five people. Let's vary the jobs first. The profile says "skilled employee / official." So maybe a scientific research assistant, a nurse, a teacher, a civil servant, and an IT technician. That gives different professions.

For each person, I need to explain why they're applying for the loan (furniture/equipment), their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Since the credit history is critical and they have other credits elsewhere, they need to address that. Also, they have a co-applicant, so maybe a spouse or partner. They need to mention their stable residence (3 years) and real estate ownership as assets. Employment is less than a year, so maybe they recently moved or changed jobs, but have a stable income now.

Let me start with the first person: a scientific research assistant. She's 27, married with one dependent. She's been in her current job for less than a year but has 8 years of experience. She and her husband (co-applicant) own real estate. They need furniture for a new apartment. Despite her recent employment, she has a steady income and existing credits at the bank are for a car and a personal loan. She can mention her stable residence and co-applicant's support.

Second person: a nurse. Maybe she's separated, living with her child. She's been working as a nurse for 5 years but recently changed hospitals, hence less than a year at current job. She needs medical equipment for her home office. She and her sister (co-applicant) own a property. She has other loans but is making payments. Emphasize her steady income and co-applicant.

Third: a primary school teacher. Married, one child. Moved to a new town for job, hence 10-month checking account. Needs furniture for their home. They own property elsewhere. Co-applicant is spouse. Despite short employment, stable teaching salary. Existing credits are for a mortgage and a car.

Fourth: a civil servant in local government. Divorced, one dependent. Recently transferred to a new city, explaining new checking account. Needs to furnish a rented apartment. Real estate owned in another city. Co-applicant is parent. Stable income as civil servant, existing credits for a home improvement loan.

Fifth: IT technician. Married, one child. Recently promoted, new job less than a year. Need equipment for home office. Own property. Co-applicant is spouse. Other loans are for education and a car. Emphasize technical skills and stable income.

I need to make sure each letter includes specific details, addresses the critical credit history by showing responsibility, mentions co-applicant, residence duration, real estate, and employment. Also, each has a unique profession and situation. Avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan (furniture vs. equipment). Check that each letter is concise, ends properly, and doesn't use formatting. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered without being too lengthy.

**Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

My name is Anna Müller, a 27-year-old scientific research assistant at the City University of Berlin. I am writing to apply for a loan of 2132 DM to purchase essential furniture for our newly rented apartment. My husband, Thomas, and I are co-applicants and jointly own a real estate property in Munich, which we have resided in for three years. Although my current employment at the university began six months ago after relocating for work, I have eight years of experience in research and a stable monthly income of 2800 DM. While I acknowledge my credit history includes a small personal loan from a different bank, I have consistently met all payments on time. My husband and I are committed to repaying this loan responsibly, and our combined income ensures we can manage the 2 DM installment rate comfortably. I kindly request your consideration based on our shared assets and financial discipline.  

Thank you for your time.  
Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

**Letter 2**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am Clara Fischer, 27, a registered nurse at St. Elisabeth Hospital. I seek a 2132 DM loan to cover medical equipment for my home office, as I now work remotely two days a week. My sister, Lena, is a co-applicant and co-owns our family’s real estate in Dresden, where we’ve lived for three years. Though I’ve held my current nursing position for only nine months after transferring hospitals, I have five years of clinical experience and earn 3200 DM monthly. My existing credit—a student loan from a different bank—is fully up to date. I understand my checking account is in deficit due to recent medical expenses, but my stable income and co-applicant’s support ensure timely repayments. I am confident in meeting the 2 DM installment commitment.  

Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Clara Fischer

**Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

My name is Sophie Weber, 27, a primary school teacher in Hamburg. I apply for a 2132 DM loan to furnish our new rental home, as we’ve recently moved for my job. My spouse, Markus, is a co-applicant, and we jointly own a vacation property in Bavaria. Though I’ve worked at my current school for eight months, I have six years of teaching experience and a consistent income of 3500 DM. My existing credits at this bank—a mortgage and a car loan—are paid punctually. While my checking account balance is temporarily negative due to relocation costs, my stable salary and shared assets guarantee I can manage the 2 DM installment. I kindly ask for your approval, assured by my dedication to repayment.  

Sincerely,  
Sophie Weber

**Letter 4**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am Lena Schmidt, 27, a civil servant in the local government office of Leipzig. I request a 2132 DM loan to purchase office furniture for my home workspace. My father, Hans, is a co-applicant and owns real estate in Leipzig, where I’ve resided for three years. Though I’ve held my current civil service position for ten months after a career transition, I have four years of administrative experience and earn 3100 DM monthly. I have an outstanding home improvement loan at another bank, but my income comfortably covers all obligations. My commitment to public service and financial responsibility make me a reliable borrower. I am confident in fulfilling the 2 DM installment terms.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lena Schmidt

**Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am Nina Becker, 27, an IT technician at TechNova Solutions. I apply for a 2132 DM loan to acquire equipment for my home-based tech support business. My husband, Daniel, is a co-applicant, and we own real estate in Cologne, where we’ve lived for three years. Though I’ve worked at TechNova for seven months after a promotion, I have five years of IT experience and a monthly income of 3300 DM. My existing credit—a student loan from another bank—is fully paid on schedule. While my checking account is currently overdrawn due to a recent laptop repair, my stable earnings and co-applicant’s support ensure timely repayment of the 2 DM installment. I respectfully request your approval.  

Thank you.  
Sincerely,  
Nina Becker
