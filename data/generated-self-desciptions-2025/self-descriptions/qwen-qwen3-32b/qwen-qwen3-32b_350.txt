Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile says the person is a foreign worker, male, single, 34 years old, living in their own housing, has been in their current residence for 2 years, has savings between 100-500 DM, has a credit history with past delays, no checking account, has been employed for 1-4 years (let me pick 3 years), currently has two existing credits at the bank, works as an unskilled resident worker (maybe a construction laborer?), the loan purpose is business, amount is 1743 DM, installment rate 1, no other installment plans, no phone, one dependent.

So for each letter, I need to vary the specifics. Let me think of different business purposes. Maybe a food stall, a repair service, a small retail shop, a delivery service, and a cleaning business. Each person's story should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy despite past credit issues.

First person: Let's say a construction worker wants to start a food cart. He's been in Germany for 3 years, has savings of 300 DM. He mentions his stable residence, owns a property (maybe a small apartment), and has two existing loans (maybe a bike and a phone loan). He explains past payment delays due to irregular work but now has a steady job. He'll use the loan to buy ingredients and equipment, generate income to repay.

Second person: Maybe a repair service. Let's name her Amina. She's been in Germany for 2 years, works as a helper but has repair skills. Savings of 200 DM. She wants to buy tools and set up a workshop. She mentions her real estate as collateral and her dependents, showing responsibility.

Third person: A small retail shop. Let's say Carlos, a warehouse worker. He has 400 DM savings. He wants to open a convenience store in his neighborhood. He's been in his job for 3 years, has a good work ethic. Past delays were due to medical emergencies but now is stable. He can repay with the shop's profits.

Fourth person: Delivery service. Maybe a person named Raj, who has been working in logistics. He needs a scooter to start deliveries. His savings are 150 DM. He's been living in the same place for 2 years, owns property. He'll use the loan for the scooter and uniforms, ensuring timely repayments.

Fifth person: Cleaning business. Let's say Fatima, a factory worker. She has 100 DM savings. She wants to buy cleaning supplies and a van. She's had past delays due to low income but now has a better job. She'll use the loan to start the business, which will provide steady income.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, mentions specific numbers (like 3 years employment, 2 years residence, 300 DM savings), explains the business purpose clearly, addresses past credit issues by explaining the reason and current stability, and shows commitment to repayment. Also, each person's job and business should be different. Avoid any formatting, keep the language simple and direct. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they all fit the profile and are unique.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Daniel M. and I am a 34-year-old construction worker from Nigeria who has been living in Germany for three years. I currently work as an unskilled laborer at a local building site and earn a stable monthly income of 1,800 DM. I have no checking account but maintain a savings account with 300 DM. I am applying for a 1,743 DM loan to purchase a food cart to sell traditional West African dishes at a nearby market.  

In the past, I experienced delays in repaying a mobile phone installment due to irregular work hours during a construction slowdown. However, my current employer has guaranteed steady employment for the next two years, and I have lived in my own apartment for the past two years. I already have two small credits with this bank (a bicycle loan and a tool kit loan) and have consistently repaid them. With this loan, I aim to generate daily profits of 50–70 DM to cover repayments. I kindly request your support to start this venture, which will provide for my young daughter and improve my financial stability.  

Sincerely  
Daniel M.  



Dear Sir/Madam  

I am Amina S., a 34-year-old textile worker from Bangladesh, married with one child. I have resided in Germany for 2.5 years and currently live in my own apartment. I work as an unskilled worker in a garment factory, earning 1,600 DM monthly. My savings account holds 200 DM, and I have no checking account. I am applying for a 1,743 DM loan to establish a small sewing and repair service in my home.  

Previously, I missed payments on a utility bill due to a family emergency in my home country, but I have since resolved this and prioritized timely payments. I have worked at my current job for 18 months and own a small property in my hometown as collateral. This business will allow me to earn an additional 100 DM weekly, ensuring I can repay the loan installments. I am committed to improving my credit history and supporting my family. Please consider my application.  

Thank you  
Amina S.  



Dear Bank Team  

My name is Carlos R., a 34-year-old warehouse worker from Mexico. I have lived in Germany for three years and own a modest apartment. I work 40 hours weekly at a logistics company, earning 1,900 DM, and have 400 DM in savings. I request a 1,743 DM loan to open a convenience store in my neighborhood, selling snacks and household items.  

In the past, I delayed paying a utility bill due to unexpected medical expenses for my mother, who lives with me. I have since organized my finances and have consistently repaid my two existing bank loans (a laptop and a fridge). My employer confirms my reliability, and I have resided in my current home for two years. This store will generate daily revenue to cover the loan. I assure you of my dedication to repayment and ask for your trust.  

Respectfully  
Carlos R.  



Dear Bank Manager  

I am Raj K., a 34-year-old logistics assistant from India, living in Germany for 2.5 years. I work as an unskilled worker at a freight company, earning 1,700 DM monthly. I have no checking account but hold 150 DM in savings. I apply for a 1,743 DM loan to purchase a scooter and uniforms for a freelance delivery service.  

A prior delay in paying a rent installment occurred due to a temporary job gap, but I have now secured stable employment for the next three years. I own property in my hometown and have two existing credits with this bank. My scooter will enable me to deliver groceries locally, earning 60–80 DM daily. I will allocate 20 DM weekly to repay this loan. Your support will help me build a reliable income and improve my credit standing.  

Sincerely  
Raj K.
