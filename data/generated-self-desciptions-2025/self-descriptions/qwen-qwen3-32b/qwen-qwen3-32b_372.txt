Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the provided profile. First, I need to parse the profile details carefully.

The profile has specific attributes: no checking account, 36 months duration, good credit history, purpose is a new car, amount 3079, no savings account, employment for 1-4 years, installment rate 4, single male, no debtors, residence since 4 months, property is real estate, age 36, no other installment plans, housing is own, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee/official, one dependent, no phone, foreign worker yes.

Each letter needs to be from a different person, so I have to vary the specifics while sticking to the profile. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs like "automotive technician" or "civil servant." Also, need to invent specific instances for generic attributes. Each letter should explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy.

First, I'll start with the structure. Each letter should have a proper beginning, middle, and end. They should be concise, so maybe 3-4 paragraphs. Need to mention the purpose (car loan), their stable employment, existing credit paid back, residence, and other factors from the profile. Also, since they're foreign workers, maybe mention their legal status or ties to the community.

Let me think of different job roles. The profile says "skilled employee / official." So possibilities: automotive technician, civil servant (like a public administrator), electrician, IT technician, or maybe a teacher? But need to check if those fit as skilled employees. Also, each person's reason for the car might vary. For example, one needs it for commuting to work, another for freelance jobs requiring transportation, another for family needs, etc.

Also, since they have real estate, maybe mention owning property as a sign of stability. The installment rate is 4, which might refer to the percentage or the monthly payment. Need to ensure that their income is sufficient to handle the installment. Each letter should highlight their ability to repay.

Need to avoid using any formatting, so just plain text with line breaks. Also, make sure not to cut off the letters. Each should have a proper closing, like "Sincerely," followed by the name.

Let me start drafting the first one. Let's pick an automotive technician. He's applying for a car loan to replace his old car, which is necessary for commuting to his job. He's been employed for 2 years, has a stable job, owns real estate, and has already paid back previous credits. He mentions his residence duration, no savings account but emphasizes his timely payments. Since he's a foreign worker, maybe mention his legal residency and commitment to fulfilling obligations.

Second letter: Maybe a civil servant, like a public administrator. He needs a car for work-related travel. He's been in his job for 3 years, has a steady income, owns property. He can emphasize his stable employment and existing credit history.

Third: Electrician. Needs a reliable car for client visits. Employed for 1.5 years, but maybe he has a contractor position. Highlight his steady income and real estate ownership.

Fourth: IT technician. Needs a car for freelance work that requires mobility. Employed for 2.5 years. Maybe mention that even though he's a foreign worker, he has a long-term residency plan and stable income.

Fifth: Maybe a teacher or another official. Let's say a school administrator. Needs a car for daily commute and to transport dependent. Emphasize the necessity for family and existing responsibility shown by owning property and repaying past credits.

Each letter needs to have unique specifics. Also, check that all profile elements are addressed: no checking account, savings unknown/no, employment duration, residence since 4 months, etc. Also, each person has one dependent, so mention a child or relative they support.

Need to ensure that the letters don't repeat the same phrases. Vary the language while keeping the structure consistent. Also, since they don't have a telephone, maybe mention that they prefer written communication or it's a oversight they'll rectify, but maybe it's better to omit unless necessary. The profile says telephone: none, but maybe not crucial unless the bank requires it. Since it's a motivation letter, focus on positive aspects.

Make sure each letter ends properly, with the applicant expressing hope for approval and willingness to provide more info. Sign off with their name and contact info if needed, but maybe the user doesn't require that. The example letters in the query don't have it, so maybe just "Sincerely, [Name]".

Check for each profile attribute in every letter. For example, each has 1 dependent, so each letter should mention supporting a family member. Each has real estate as property, so mention owning a home. Each has an existing credit paid back, so reference that. Employment between 1-4 years, so use different durations like 2 years, 3 years, etc.

Avoid generic terms. Instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs. Also, the loan amount is 3079, so each letter should mention the exact figure. The purpose is a new car, so each wants to buy a new one, not used. Maybe vary the reasons slightly: commuting, work requirements, family needs, etc.

Now, start drafting each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered without repetition. Check for conciseness, proper structure, and that each is unique yet adheres to the profile.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Carlos Mendez, and I am applying for a car loan of 3079 euros to purchase a reliable vehicle for my daily commute as an automotive technician at Stuttgart Motors. I have worked there for 2.5 years, earning a stable monthly income of 2800 euros. While I currently do not have a checking account, I have consistently paid back my existing personal loan of 2000 euros over 18 months, which I took to cover my sister’s medical expenses. I own a small apartment in Ludwigsburg and have resided there for the past four months. As a foreign worker with a permanent residency permit, I prioritize fulfilling financial obligations, as demonstrated by my timely repayments. I am committed to repaying this loan with the same diligence.  

Sincerely,

Dear [Bank Name],  

I am writing to request a car loan to support my role as a public administrator at the municipal office in Dresden. My job, which I’ve held for 36 months, requires frequent travel between departments, and a new vehicle will enhance my efficiency. I currently own real estate in Leipzig and have maintained a flawless credit history, having repaid a prior bank loan for home repairs. Though I do not have a savings account, my monthly salary of 3200 euros ensures I can manage the 4% installment rate comfortably. I am a single father to a 6-year-old daughter, and this car will also ease our family’s mobility needs. As a foreign national with a work visa, I value trust and stability, which I aim to prove through this loan.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller
