Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. First, I need to parse the profile to understand the specifics.

The profile includes details like a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM, a 15-month duration, good credit history, purpose is a new car, credit amount 6850, savings between 100-500 DM, unemployed currently, installment rate 1, single male, no other debtors, residence since 2 years, property as building society savings or life insurance, age 34, no other installment plans, own housing, one existing credit at the bank, job in management/self-employed/highly qualified, two dependents, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be from a different person, so I should vary the job roles. The example mentions "scientific research assistant" instead of generic terms. So I need to think of five distinct roles under the job category mentioned: management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, officer. Let me brainstorm roles like IT project manager, freelance graphic designer, hospital manager, consulting engineer, and self-employed electrician.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan (car purchase), their financial situation (unemployed but with savings, existing credit paid back, residence, etc.), and why they're trustworthy. They need to mention specific numbers from the profile: 15 months checking account, 6850 DM loan, 100-500 DM savings, 2 dependents, etc.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, not too long. Start with addressing the bank, state purpose, explain current situation, financial stability, repayment ability, and close with thanks. Also, ensure each person's circumstances are unique enough but fit the profile. For example, unemployment but with other income sources or savings. Mention the existing credit paid back properly. Maybe one has a part-time job, another has freelance work, etc.

Check for the specific attributes: each must have 15 months of checking account, 2 years residence, one existing credit, savings between 100-500. Also, they are all 34, single, male, with two dependents. Maybe vary the reasons for unemployment: studying, family reasons, transitioning jobs. Each should have a different angle but stick to the profile.

Need to avoid generic terms. Instead of "skilled employee," use specific roles. Also, ensure that each letter doesn't cut off and has a proper ending. No formatting, just plain text. Let me start drafting each letter with these points in mind.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Lars Müller, and I am applying for a 6850 DM loan to purchase a new vehicle for my work as a freelance IT consultant. I have been self-employed for 8 years, providing software solutions to local businesses, and my income averages 2500 DM monthly. Though I am currently between contracts after completing a major project, I have maintained my checking account with your bank for 15 months, consistently repaid my previous 4000 DM loan for office equipment, and saved 350 DM in a building society bond. My wife and two-year-old daughter rely on my income, so a reliable car is essential for client visits. I am confident in my ability to manage repayments, given my stable freelance history and existing savings. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller  



Dear [Bank Name],  

I am Thomas Weber, a 34-year-old registered foreign worker and part-time logistics officer at a local warehouse. I seek a 6850 DM loan to replace my aging car, which is critical for commuting to work and transporting my two children to school. Despite being unemployed for three months due to a temporary industry slowdown, I have repaid all prior credits with your bank, including a 2000 DM personal loan in 2022. My savings account holds 480 DM, and I own a life insurance policy valued at 1200 DM. I reside in my own apartment and have lived here for two years. My part-time job guarantees 1400 DM monthly, supplemented by freelance deliveries. I assure you of my commitment to timely repayments.  

Respectfully,  
Thomas Weber  



Dear [Bank Name],  

As a hospital laboratory technician earning 2200 DM monthly, I request a 6850 DM loan to purchase a new car for my night shifts and medical appointments. My name is Jan Koch, and though I have been unemployed since March due to a family health crisis, I have a strong repayment history with your bank, including a fully settled 5000 DM mortgage credit. My savings account currently holds 250 DM, and I own a building society savings agreement worth 8000 DM. I have lived at my residence for two years and am single with two dependents. I am now recovering and have secured temporary work at a clinic, with a return to full employment pending. Your support would restore my mobility and ensure I meet repayment obligations.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jan Koch
