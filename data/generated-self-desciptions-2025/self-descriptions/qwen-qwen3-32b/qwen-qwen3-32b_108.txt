Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile says the person is male, single, 39 years old, has been in their current job for at least 7 years, and their job is in management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, or officer. They have no checking account, have a savings account or bonds under 100 DM, have two existing credits at the bank paid back duly, reside in their own housing, have two dependents, and are a registered foreign worker with a telephone.

First, I need to create five different personas. Let me think of different job roles within the job category mentioned. The profile mentions "management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/office." So possible roles could be a project manager, a self-employed consultant, a senior IT specialist, a regional sales manager, and a financial analyst.

Each person will have a unique reason for applying for a car loan (new car), each with specific details. Let me assign each a different job and come up with specific instances. For example, one could be a project manager at a construction firm, another a self-employed graphic designer, etc.

Next, each letter needs to explain why they need the loan. The purpose is a new car, so maybe for work-related reasons, commuting, business use, etc. They need to mention their stable employment (at least 7 years), current residence for 4 years, two dependents, existing credits paid back, and why they're trustworthy.

Also, since they don't have a checking account, maybe they use savings or other methods. Their savings are under 100 DM, so they might need the loan to bridge the gap for the car purchase. They have a telephone, which shows they can be reached, and they're registered as foreign workers, which might indicate legal status and stability.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, specific, and includes all required elements without being too generic. Let me outline each person:

1. Project Manager at a construction company. Needs a car for client visits. Stable job for 8 years, owns a home, two kids, paid back previous loans.

2. Self-employed IT Consultant. Needs a reliable car for client meetings. Been in business for 7 years, has a good credit history, two dependents.

3. Senior Marketing Specialist. Requires a car for travel to different branches. Employed for 9 years, owns home, two dependents, timely payments.

4. Regional Sales Manager. Needs a vehicle to visit retailers. 7 years in role, stable income, two children, good credit.

5. Financial Analyst. Needs a car for daily commute and work trips. 8 years employed, owns home, two dependents, responsible with loans.

Now, for each letter, start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then a salutation. The body should state the purpose, their financial situation (current job duration, residence, existing credits, dependents), and why they're trustworthy. Conclude with thanks and a sign-off.

Check for specific numbers: loan amount 6458, installment rate 2. Mention the exact amount they're applying for. Also, mention they don't have a checking account but have managed other credits well.

Avoid generic terms. Use specific job titles, years (e.g., 8 years instead of >=7), and specific reasons for the car. Make sure each letter is unique but fits the profile. Also, ensure that each ends properly without any cutoff.

Let me start drafting each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered and each has a distinct voice based on their profession.

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 6,458 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a project manager at a construction firm, I require a reliable car to attend client meetings across the region.

I currently have two existing credits with your bank, both repaid punctually, and I am a registered foreign worker with a valid telephone number for communication. While I do not maintain a checking account, my savings of 80 DM reflect my cautious financial habits. With two dependents, I prioritize responsible spending and view this loan as an investment in my professional efficiency. I assure you of timely repayments at the agreed installment rate of 2 DM.  

Thank you for considering my application.

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 6,458 DM loan to acquire a new car essential for my self-employed graphic design business. Over the past 7 years, I have built a steady clientele, earning 3,800 DM monthly.

As a registered foreign worker, I value financial responsibility and have no other debts beyond my existing installment plans with your bank. I am confident in my ability to meet the 2 DM monthly installment.  

Thank you for your trust in my capability.
