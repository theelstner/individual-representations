Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. First, I need to parse the profile details carefully to make sure I include all the specific attributes.

The profile mentions a foreign worker who's 31, single, has a dependent, owns a car or other property, has a savings account between 100-500 DM, no checking account, existing credits paid back, employment for over 7 years, residence for 4 years, and the loan purpose is radio/television. The credit amount is 3621 DM, installment rate 2. Each letter needs to be unique but fit these parameters.

First, I need to come up with five different scenarios. Let's think about different job roles. The profile says "skilled employee / official," so maybe a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a teacher, a nurse, and an IT technician. Each should have a specific reason for needing the loan for radio/television. Maybe they need equipment for work or a business-related purpose?

Wait, radio/television as a purpose might be for a business, like a radio station or TV repair shop? Or maybe they need equipment for their job. Alternatively, maybe it's for personal use, but since they're applying as a foreign worker, perhaps it's for a small business venture. Let me check the original purpose: "radio/television" is the category. Maybe they need to buy equipment for their work or a small business.

Each person should have a unique angle. For example, one could be a radio technician needing equipment, another a TV repair business owner, maybe someone in media production, or a teacher using it for educational content. Let me think of five distinct roles.

1. Scientific Research Assistant: Maybe needs a TV or radio for research purposes? Or to present findings.
2. Automotive Mechanic: Perhaps needs a TV for a waiting area or radio equipment for car installations.
3. Part-Time TV Repair Technician: Needs tools or equipment for repairs.
4. Community Radio Volunteer: Needs equipment to start a radio project.
5. IT Support Specialist: Maybe setting up a small media business on the side.

Each letter should explain their situation, why they need the loan, their financial stability (existing credits paid, savings, job stability), and trustworthiness. They all have 2 existing credits at the bank, so I should mention that. Also, they have a dependent, so maybe mention supporting their family.

Need to make sure each letter is concise, no formatting, proper ending. Let me start drafting each one with specific details. Check the numbers: age 31, 4 years residence, 24 months duration in the profile? Wait, the profile says "Duration in month:24"—does that refer to the existing credits? Maybe the duration of the loan they're applying for? The credit amount is 3621 DM, installment rate 2. Maybe the letters should mention the amount and how they'll repay.

Also, no checking account, savings between 100-500 DM. So they might need to open a checking account as part of the loan process? Maybe mention their savings as proof of responsibility.

Each letter needs to be from a different person with unique names and specific roles. Let me assign names and jobs. Let me start with the first one.

First person: Let's say a scientific research assistant at a university, working on environmental projects. He needs a radio for field communication. He has a stable job for 8 years, savings of 300 DM, lives in his own housing, has two existing credits (maybe for a car or computer). He's a foreign worker, single, with a dependent (maybe a child). He explains his need, financial situation, and trustworthiness.

Second person: Automotive mechanic. He wants to buy a TV for his shop's waiting area to keep customers entertained. He's been employed at the same garage for 7 years, has savings of 400 DM, owns a car. He's responsible with paying back previous credits.

Third: Part-time TV repair technician. He needs specialized tools or equipment to expand his services. He's been in his job for 8 years, has a dependent, and has managed his previous loans well.

Fourth: Community radio volunteer. He wants to start a local radio station to promote cultural integration. Needs equipment. He's a foreign worker contributing to the community, has a stable job as an official in a local NGO.

Fifth: IT support specialist. He wants to purchase a TV for online tutoring sessions to teach computer skills. He's been in his job for 8 years, has savings, and needs the equipment to expand his teaching.

Each letter should mention their specific job, duration of employment, existing credits, savings, residence, and how the loan will be used. Emphasize trustworthiness by mentioning past credit history. Make sure each is unique and fits the profile parameters. Avoid generic terms, use specific numbers like 8 years, 4 years residence, etc. Also, note that they don't have a telephone, so maybe mention that they prefer in-person communication or have another way to stay reachable.

Check that each letter is concise, ends properly, and doesn't use any formatting. Let me draft each one now.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, and I am a scientific research assistant at the Institute of Environmental Studies, where I have worked for the past 8 years. I am writing to request a loan of 3,621 DM to purchase a specialized radio equipment set required for my fieldwork on climate data collection.  

I have consistently paid back my previous credits, including a 2019 loan for laboratory supplies and a 2021 car loan. Though I currently do not hold a checking account, I maintain a savings account with 350 DM, which I have built through disciplined budgeting. I reside in my own apartment and support my 5-year-old son. As a foreign worker with a stable income, I prioritize financial responsibility and view this loan as essential to advancing my research. I kindly ask for your trust in my ability to repay this amount reliably.  

Sincerely,
