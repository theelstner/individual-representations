Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details. 

First, the profile says the person is a skilled employee or official, so I need to come up with specific jobs. The example given is a scientific research assistant. Let me think of others: maybe a mechanic, a teacher, a nurse, a software developer, and an electrician. Each of these is a skilled job.

The profile mentions they have no checking account but have been in their current job for 4-7 years. Let me pick specific durations, like 5 years for one, 6 for another, etc. The credit history is good, existing credits paid back. The loan purpose is business, so each person needs a specific business idea. Examples could be starting a repair shop, a small tutoring service, a catering business, an IT consulting firm, or an electrical contracting business.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They all have savings under 100 DM, own a car or other property, live in their own housing, have one dependent, and a telephone. Also, they have other installment plans like store payments. 

I need to make sure each letter is unique. Let me outline each person:

1. **Mechanic**: Wants to open a repair shop. Has been working at a garage for 5 years. Paid back a previous loan for tools. Needs 1950 DM for equipment. Trustworthy because of steady income and good credit history.

2. **Teacher**: Starting an after-school tutoring program. Worked as a substitute teacher for 6 years. Uses savings and a car as collateral. Trustworthy due to stable employment and timely payments.

3. **Nurse**: Launching a home healthcare service. Employed at a clinic for 4 years. Has a car and owns a house. Trustworthy because of reliable job and no defaults.

4. **Software Developer**: Starting an IT consulting firm. Worked at a tech company for 5 years. Needs funds for software licenses. Trustworthy with existing credits paid off.

5. **Electrician**: Opening an electrical contracting business. Has 6 years of experience. Uses his car as collateral. Trustworthy with a steady income and good credit.

Each letter should mention their specific job, years employed, business purpose, assets (car, home), and their responsible financial history. Also, note the dependent (maybe a child) and telephone ownership. Avoid checking account, but that's okay since the profile says no checking account. Make sure each letter is concise, ends properly, and doesn't use formatting. Let me start drafting each one, ensuring they are distinct and follow the profile.

Dear Sir/Madam,  
My name is Lars Müller, 34, a certified automotive mechanic employed at Hansa Garage for 5 years. I am applying for a 1,950 DM loan to purchase tools and establish my own repair shop.

I request your trust in my ability to generate reliable revenue through this business. Thank you for considering my application.

Dear Bank Representative,  
I am Thomas Weber, 34, a substitute biology teacher at Munich Gymnasium, working here for 6 years. The 1,950 DM loan will fund an after-school tutoring service for 30 students.

Dear Sir/Madam,  
As a registered nurse at St. Anna Clinic for 4 years, I seek a 1,950 DM loan to launch a home healthcare service. My 2,200 DM salary allows me to maintain my residence and a 1999 Opel Astra. I have no checking account but manage finances diligently, as evidenced by my paid-off medical equipment loan here. With one dependent and a telephone for client communication, I am committed to expanding accessible care. This business aligns with my 12-year nursing career. Thank you for your confidence in my vision.  

Respectfully,  
Anna Schmidt
