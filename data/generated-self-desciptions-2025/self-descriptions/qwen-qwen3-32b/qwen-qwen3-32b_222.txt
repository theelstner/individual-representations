Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

First, the profile has several attributes. Let me note them down:

- Checking account: 0 to less than 200 DM
- Duration of checking account: 12 months
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly
- Purpose: radio/television
- Credit amount: 625 DM
- Savings account/bonds: less than 100 DM
- Present employment since: less than 1 year
- Installment rate: 4
- Personal status: male, married/widowed
- Other debtors/guarantors: guarantor
- Present residence since: 1 month
- Property: real estate
- Age: 26
- Other installment plans: bank
- Housing: own
- Number of existing credits at this bank: 1
- Job: unskilled - resident
- Dependents: 1
- Telephone: none
- Foreign worker: yes

Each letter needs to be from a different person, so I need to vary the specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant," but in the profile, the job is "unskilled - resident." So I need to think of different unskilled jobs. Also, the purpose is radio/television, so maybe each person has a slightly different reason for needing the TV or radio—like for a child's education, family gatherings, etc.

Let me brainstorm some job roles for unskilled residents. Maybe construction worker, factory worker, cleaner, delivery helper, or agricultural worker. Each person is a foreign worker, married or widowed, with one dependent, living in their own house, with real estate, and has a guarantor.

For each letter, I need to mention their job, how long they've been employed (less than a year), their financial situation (checking account <200 DM, savings <100 DM), the purpose of the loan (radio/TV), why they need it, their credit history (paid back previous loans), and why they're trustworthy (with a guarantor, own property, etc.).

Also, each letter should be concise, not too long, and properly ended. Let me outline each person:

1. Construction worker, married with a child, needs TV for educational programs for the child. Guarantor is his brother.

2. Factory worker, widowed, has a dependent mother, wants TV for family entertainment. Guarantor is a cousin.

3. Cleaner, married, wants a radio for a small business (selling news and info to colleagues). Guarantor is a friend.

Wait, the purpose is radio/television. Maybe vary between TV and radio. Also, the third person could be a delivery helper needing a radio for staying updated with work schedules. Fourth could be an agricultural worker needing a TV for market prices. Fifth could be a maintenance worker needing a radio for communication.

Need to make sure each has different specifics. Let me check each attribute is covered. For example, each has a guarantor, different jobs, different purposes, etc. Also, mention their savings and checking account status, their employment duration, existing credit paid back, etc.

Now, write each letter step by step, ensuring all points are included without being too verbose. Use proper structure: address, salutation, body paragraphs explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, thanks, sign-off with name and contact info if needed. But since it's a motivation letter, maybe not formal address? Wait, the user didn't specify, but the example letters in the query probably don't need formal structure. Just the content. Let me check the example given by the user in the instructions. The user says "do not use any formatting," so maybe just the text of the letter without addresses. Each letter starts with a salutation like "Dear Sir or Madam," then body paragraphs.

Let me start drafting the first one.

First person: Construction worker, 26, married, 1 child, employed for 10 months, checking account 150 DM, savings 50 DM, guarantor is brother. Purpose: TV for child's education. Mention previous credit paid back, own house, guarantor.

Second: Factory worker, 26, widowed, 1 dependent (mother), employed 8 months, checking 180 DM, savings 80 DM. Purpose: TV for family gatherings. Guarantor is cousin.

Third: Cleaner, 26, married, 1 child, employed 5 months, checking 100 DM, savings 30 DM. Purpose: Radio to start a small business (selling info to colleagues). Guarantor is friend.

Fourth: Agricultural worker, 26, married, employed 11 months, checking 170 DM, savings 90 DM. Purpose: TV to check market prices. Guarantor is uncle.

Fifth: Maintenance worker, 26, widowed, dependent father, employed 6 months, checking 120 DM, savings 40 DM. Purpose: Radio for communication with team. Guarantor is coworker.

Each letter needs to mention their job, duration of employment, checking account and savings amounts, purpose, guarantor, previous credit history, and why they are trustworthy. Keep it concise. Avoid repetition in reasons. Make sure each has unique specifics. Let me write each letter now.

Dear Sir or Madam  

I am writing to request a loan of 625 DM to purchase a television for my household. As a construction worker employed for the past 10 months, I earn a stable income but currently maintain a checking account with 150 DM due to recent expenses. My savings account holds 50 DM, and I have a history of repaying previous credits in full. Though I have only lived in my own residence for one month, I own real estate and am supported by my brother as a guarantor. My wife and I have one child, and a television would provide educational programs to support his development. I assure you of my commitment to repay the loan responsibly.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed K.

Dear Sir or Madam  

I seek a 625 DM loan to acquire a television for my family. Working as a factory operator for eight months, my checking account balance is 180 DM, with 80 DM in savings. I am a widower with one dependent, my mother, and reside in my own home. My cousin has kindly agreed to act as guarantor. I have no telephone but manage my finances diligently, having repaid prior debts without issue. A television would allow us to gather for evening news and entertainment. I guarantee timely repayment of installments.  

Respectfully,  
Luis M.
