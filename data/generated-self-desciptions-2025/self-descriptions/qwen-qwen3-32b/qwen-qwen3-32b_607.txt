Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile has several attributes. Let me list them out:

- Existing checking account: less than 0 DM, duration 24 months.
- Credit history: all credits at this bank paid back duly.
- Purpose: furniture/equipment.
- Credit amount: 2828 DM.
- Savings account/bonds: between 500-1000 DM.
- Present employment since: 1-4 years.
- Personal status: male, single.
- Other debtors/guarantors: none.
- Present residence since: 4 years.
- Property: real estate.
- Age: 22.
- Other installment plans: stores.
- Housing: own.
- Number of existing credits at this bank: 1.
- Job: skilled employee or official.
- Dependents: 1.
- Telephone: yes.
- Foreign worker: registered under the customer's name.

Each letter needs to be from a different person. So I need to vary the specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe use different jobs like "scientific research assistant," "electrician," etc. Also, vary the reasons for the loan within the furniture/equipment category. Maybe one needs a sofa, another a desk, another kitchen equipment, etc.

Let me think of five different scenarios. Each person should have a unique job, reason for the loan, and maybe some unique aspects of their situation. Also, make sure they all mention their good credit history, existing savings, stable residence, employment, etc., as per the profile.

First person: Maybe a scientific research assistant applying for furniture. Let's say he's working at a university. He needs a new desk and chair for his home office. He has a savings account with 700 DM. He's been employed for 3 years. He has a dependent, maybe a parent or sibling. He has a telephone. He's a registered foreign worker.

Second person: An electrician. Needs to buy tools or equipment. Let's say he's been employed for 2 years. He wants to upgrade his tools for better efficiency. His savings are 600 DM. He lives in his own house, has a dependent, etc.

Third person: Maybe a teacher or another skilled worker. Applying for furniture for a new apartment. Let's say she needs a sofa and dining table. She's been at her job for 3 years, has savings of 800 DM.

Fourth person: A data entry clerk. Needs to buy a new computer for work from home. Let's say they have 500 DM in savings. They have a dependent, maybe a child.

Fifth person: A mechanic. Needs to purchase tools for his home garage. Let's say he's been employed for 4 years, has 900 DM in savings.

Wait, but the job in the profile is "skilled employee / official." So need to pick appropriate jobs. Let me check the original profile again. The job is "skilled employee / official." So maybe use specific roles like electrician, teacher, mechanic, IT technician, etc.

Also, each person should mention their existing credit history (all paid back duly), current employment duration, savings amount, residence since 4 years, own housing, etc.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, not too long. Start with the applicant's name, address, date. Then address the bank, state the purpose, explain their financial situation, why they're trustworthy, and conclude with thanks and signature.

Let me outline each letter:

1. Scientific Research Assistant - Home office furniture. Savings 700 DM. Employed 3 years. Dependent: mother. Tools: uses store installment plans. Good credit history.

2. Electrician - Tools and equipment. Savings 600 DM. Employed 2 years. Dependent: sister. Owns home. Paid back previous loan.

3. Teacher - Furniture for new apartment. Savings 800 DM. Employed 3 years. Dependent: young brother. Good credit, owns property.

4. IT Technician - Upgrading computer equipment. Savings 550 DM. Employed 3 years. Dependent: daughter. Existing loan paid back.

5. Mechanic - Workshop tools. Savings 900 DM. Employed 4 years. Dependent: father. Owns home, reliable payment history.

Each letter should have these elements but phrased differently. Make sure to mention the exact credit amount (2828 DM), purpose, and other attributes. Also, mention that they have a telephone, which might indicate stability.

Now, I need to write each letter with these specifics. Make sure each is unique but follows the profile. Avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan. Check that all required profile elements are included in each letter. Also, keep them short and proper, ending with a closing statement.

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,828 DM to purchase essential furniture for my home office.

As a registered foreign worker with a German telephone, I am committed to maintaining financial responsibility. I assure you this loan will be repaid promptly, as my employment and assets provide a solid foundation for reliability.
