Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says the person is a single male, 35 years old, has a checking account for 24 months (so about 2 years), no savings account or bonds over 100 DM. They have a critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank. They're employed as a skilled employee or official for 4-7 years. They want a loan for a used car, amount 2346, installment rate 4. They have no other debtors, live in their own house, have 2 existing credits at the bank, own property like a car, have a telephone, and are a registered foreign worker.

I need to create five different individuals. Let me think of different job roles first. The profile mentions "skilled employee / official". Let me pick specific jobs: maybe a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a teacher, a nurse, and an IT technician. Each should have unique details but fit the profile.

Each letter needs to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their job, duration, savings, existing credits, residence, etc. Also, they have a critical credit history but need to show they can repay. Maybe they have a stable job, dependents, own a home, etc.

Let me start with the first one: a scientific research assistant. He's been working at a university for 6 years. He needs the car for commuting. He has two existing credits at the bank (maybe a laptop and software). He's lived in his residence for 3 years. He's a foreign worker registered. He'll mention his stable income and that he's improving his creditworthiness.

Second: a mechanic. He's been working at a garage for 5 years. Needs a car for work and family. Existing credits could be tools and equipment. He's responsible, pays on time. Maybe he's had past issues but is now better.

Third: a teacher. Wait, the job is skilled employee, so maybe a primary school teacher. She's been teaching for 5 years. Needs a car to transport her child. She's a single parent. She has two credits (maybe a laptop and a previous car loan). She's stable in her job and residence.

Fourth: a nurse. Worked at a clinic for 6 years. Needs a car for shifts and dependents. Existing credits for courses. She's reliable, has a good income, owns a home.

Fifth: IT technician. Worked at a company for 5 years. Needs a car for client visits. Existing credits for certifications. Stable job, owns a home, responsible with finances.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, mentions specific numbers (like 8 years instead of generic), explains the purpose, and why they're trustworthy despite critical credit history. Each should have a unique job and situation but fit the profile parameters. Also, each should have a proper ending thanking the bank and expressing hope for approval.

Check for each letter: name, job, duration, purpose, existing credits, residence, dependents, foreign worker status. Avoid formatting, keep paragraphs short. Make sure they don't cut off. Let me draft each one now.

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Lars Müller, and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Hamburg, where I have worked for the past 6 years. I am writing to request a loan of 2,346 DM to purchase a reliable used car. As a foreign worker registered under my name, I have consistently earned a stable income, yet my current vehicle is no longer roadworthy, making it difficult to commute to work and care for my 4-year-old daughter. While my credit history has faced challenges due to a previous loan for laboratory equipment, I have resolved those issues by maintaining timely payments on my two existing credits here (a laptop and software package). I reside in my own apartment in Stade, where I have lived for 3 years, and I own a savings bond worth 80 DM. I assure you that my disciplined approach to budgeting and my secure employment will allow me to meet the monthly installment of 4 DM. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller  



Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Thomas Becker, a certified mechanic employed at Autohaus Kiel for 5 years. I seek a 2,346 DM loan to replace my aging car, which is essential for reaching my workplace and transporting my 6-year-old son. Though my credit history includes a critical period due to a prior motorcycle loan, I have since improved my financial habits and now manage two existing credits at your bank (a toolset and safety gear). I live in my own home in Lübeck, where I have resided for 3 years, and I own a second-hand car valued at 1,200 DM. My monthly income exceeds my expenses, allowing me to allocate funds for this installment. As a foreign worker registered under my name, I take pride in my responsibility and punctuality. I hope you will grant my request.  

Kind regards,  
Thomas Becker  



Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Anna Richter, a primary school teacher at the Berlin-Charlottenburg School District, employed for 5 years. I need a used car to safely transport my 3-year-old son and commute to work. My current vehicle requires frequent repairs, straining my budget as a single parent. While my credit history reflects past difficulties with a student loan, I have since paid off those debts and now maintain two active credits at your bank (a laptop and professional development course). I own a residence in Spandau, where I have lived for 3 years, and hold a savings account with 70 DM. My stable salary and commitment to financial responsibility ensure I can manage the 4 DM monthly payment. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Anna Richter  



Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Jan Kovács, a registered nurse at the Charité Hospital in Berlin, where I have worked for 6 years. I am applying for a 2,346 DM loan to purchase a used car, as public transportation is insufficient for my rotating night shifts and caring for my elderly mother. My credit history includes a critical phase due to a medical certification loan, but I have since prioritized timely payments on my two existing credits (a home insurance policy and a recent medical textbook purchase). I reside in my own apartment in Neukölln for 3 years and own a savings bond worth 50 DM. My steady income and disciplined budgeting make the 4 DM installment feasible. I hope you will support my request to improve my mobility and caregiving capabilities.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jan Kovács  



Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am Michael Schmidt, an IT technician at TechSupport GmbH, employed for 5 years. I need a used car to travel between client sites and manage my 5-year-old daughter’s school drop-offs. My current vehicle is unreliable, and my credit history reflects a past issue with a certification course loan. However, I have resolved this by consistently repaying my two active credits at your bank (a laptop and software license). I own a residence in Bielefeld, where I have lived for 3 years, and hold a savings account with 90 DM. As a foreign worker registered under my name, I value reliability and have never missed a payment. My income ensures the 4 DM monthly installment is manageable. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Sincerely,  
Michael Schmidt
