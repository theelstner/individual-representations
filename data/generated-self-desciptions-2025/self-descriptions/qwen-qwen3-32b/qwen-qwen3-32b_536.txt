Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile says the person is a foreign worker, under 25 years old, single with one dependent, has been in their current job less than a year, owns a car or other property, lives in their own housing, has no savings account, has a credit history of paying back past credits, and is applying for a loan of 3105 for radio/television. They also have two existing credits at the bank.

I need to invent specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "automotive mechanic," "IT support specialist," etc. Each person's job should be different. Also, the purpose is radio/television, so maybe they need equipment for a business, personal use, or educational purposes. Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy.

Let me think of five different scenarios. Maybe:

1. A young foreign worker in Germany as an automotive mechanic, wants to buy a TV for language learning.
2. A IT support specialist from another country, needs a radio for his restaurant business.
3. A chef working in a hotel, wants to set up a home entertainment system for his family.
4. A construction worker who wants to buy a radio for his construction business to stay updated on industry news.
5. A teacher's assistant who needs a TV for creating educational content.

Each should mention their specific job, duration in current job (less than a year), being a foreign worker, having dependents, owning property (car or other), and their repayment ability based on their income. They should also mention their existing credits paid back and why they need the loan.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, starts with their name and address, date, bank details, and a proper closing. Avoid formatting, just plain text. Also, check that each letter is unique in their reasoning and specifics.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all profile attributes are covered with specific examples.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Carlos Mendez, and I am a 25-year-old automotive mechanic working at AutoTech Solutions in Munich. I have been employed there for 9 months after moving to Germany as a foreign worker. I am applying for a loan of 3105 euros to purchase a high-quality television to improve my German language skills, which is essential for advancing in my career.  

I currently live with my younger sister, who is my dependent, in our family-owned apartment. Although I do not have a savings account, I have consistently repaid my two existing credits with this bank without delay. My monthly income of 2800 euros allows me to comfortably manage the 4% installment rate. I own a used car, which I use for commuting to work.  

I assure you of my reliability through my punctual repayment history and stable employment. I am committed to repaying this loan as agreed. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendez
