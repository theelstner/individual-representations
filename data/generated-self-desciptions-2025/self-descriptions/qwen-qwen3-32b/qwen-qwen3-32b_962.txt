Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says the person has no checking account but has been in their current job for at least 7 years. Let me think of specific jobs that fit "skilled employee / official" – maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, teacher, nurse, or IT technician. That gives me five different professions to work with.

The purpose of the loan is for radio/television. I need to come up with specific reasons why each person needs this. Maybe for a home business, educational purposes, a small business setup, or to stay informed for work. Each person's reason should be unique but plausible.

They have existing credits elsewhere, not with this bank. I should mention that they have other credits but are looking to consolidate or get a better rate here. Also, they have real estate property, so maybe they own a home or land. Their savings are less than 100 DM, so they can't contribute much upfront. They have dependents, so they need the loan to support their family.

Each letter needs to explain their financial situation, why they need the loan, and why they're trustworthy. They all have been in their current job for 8 years (since >=7), are 30 years old, married or widowed, and have been in their residence for 2 years. They rent their housing. Also, they are foreign workers, so maybe they came from another country for work.

Let me outline each person:

1. Scientific Research Assistant: Needs TV for research, has real estate in home country, works at a university, has a dependent child.

2. Electrician: Wants radio for business communications, owns a small property, has a dependent parent.

3. Teacher: Needs TV for educational content, has property in hometown, works at a school, has a child.

4. Nurse: Wants radio for night shift coordination, owns land, works at a hospital, has a dependent sibling.

5. IT Technician: Needs TV for online courses, has property in home country, works for a tech company, has a child.

Each letter should mention their stable job, existing property, and how the loan will help their situation. They need to address their current lack of checking account and savings but emphasize their stable income and responsibility. Also, since they have existing credits, they should mention managing them well.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, starts with their name and address, includes their profession, purpose, financial situation, and trustworthiness. Avoid formatting, just plain text with proper endings.

Let me start drafting each one, making sure to use specific details and keep the language simple and persuasive.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Ahmed Al-Sayed, and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have worked for 8 years. I am applying for a loan of 1,740 DM to purchase a television for my home. As a foreign worker from Egypt, I rely on news broadcasts to stay informed about developments in my field and to maintain connections with my family abroad.  

I currently rent an apartment and have lived in Germany for 2 years. While I do not yet have a checking account here, I have consistently paid my salary into a savings account with my university’s affiliated bank. I own property in Cairo, which I inherited from my father, and I have no dependents beyond my elderly mother, who I financially support. Though I have two existing credits with another bank for my initial relocation costs, I have never missed a payment. My stable income and long-term employment make me a reliable candidate.  

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident I can manage this loan responsibly.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Al-Sayed

Dear Bank Manager  

I am writing to request a loan of 1,740 DM to purchase a radio for my small electrical contracting business. My name is Luis Ortega, and I have worked as a certified electrician in Hamburg for 8 years. The radio will help me stay updated on weather alerts and emergency broadcasts, which are critical for outdoor job planning.  

I have lived in my rented apartment for 2 years and own a small family plot of land in Spain. Though I do not have a checking account here, I have maintained a savings bond with 85 DM, which I have diligently contributed to for 6 months. I am married with one child and have no other debts. My current credits with another bank—taken to fund vocational training—are paid in full each month. My employer confirms my 8-year tenure and stable income.  

I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan.  

Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega
