Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the requirements.

First, the profile has several key points. The person has a checking account with less than 0 DM, has had it for 15 months. They have a credit history of paying back existing credits. The loan purpose is for business, amount 806 DM. Savings account is under 100 DM. They've been employed for 1-4 years. Personal status is female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 4 months. Property is building society savings or life insurance. Age 22. No other installment plans. Housing is own. One existing credit at the bank. Job is unskilled, resident. One dependent. No telephone. Foreign worker yes.

Each letter needs to be from a different person, so I need to vary the specifics. Let me think of different scenarios where someone in this profile would apply for a loan. The purpose is business, so maybe different types of small businesses. Let me brainstorm five different business ideas.

1. A street food vendor from Mexico, selling tacos. She's been working in Germany for 2 years, has a small savings, needs funds to buy equipment.

2. A seamstress from Vietnam, wants to start a tailoring business. She's been in Germany for 3 years, lives in her own place, has a dependent child.

3. A hairbraider from Nigeria, needs funds for a mobile hairdressing unit. She's been employed for 1 year, has a life insurance policy.

4. A market stall seller from Poland, selling handmade crafts. She's separated, has a dependent, needs to expand inventory.

5. A coffee vendor from Ethiopia, wants to open a small kiosk. She's been in Germany for 4 years, has a building society savings.

Now, each letter needs to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their employment duration, existing credit paid back, residence, and other details from the profile. Also, they should be concise, no formatting, proper ending.

Let me start drafting each letter with these ideas. Make sure to use specific numbers and roles as per the profile. Check that each has 806 DM requested, business purpose, and other attributes. Avoid generic terms, use specific job titles and instances. Also, ensure that each letter is unique in the business idea and personal circumstances.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Maria Gonzalez, a 22-year-old textile worker from Mexico who has lived in Germany for three years. I am applying for an 806 DM loan to establish a small tailoring business selling handmade embroidered blouses, which I will sell at local markets. I have been employed at a garment factory in Frankfurt for 2.5 years, earning a stable monthly income of 1,200 DM. Though my checking account balance is currently negative due to recent medical expenses, I have consistently paid my existing 500 DM installment loan for a sewing machine over the past year. I own a small apartment in Wiesbaden that I’ve resided in for four months and hold a building society savings agreement worth 80 DM. As a divorced mother of one, I prioritize financial responsibility to support my daughter. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, as my business plan includes generating 300 DM monthly profits. I kindly request your trust in my commitment to success.  

Sincerely  
Maria Gonzalez
