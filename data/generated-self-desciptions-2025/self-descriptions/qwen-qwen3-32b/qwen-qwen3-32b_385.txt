Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile has specific attributes: checking account with at least 200 DM, salary assignments for over a year, 12-month duration, good credit history, purpose is a new car, loan amount 1330 DM, savings less than 100 DM, employed less than a year, installment rate 4, single male, no other debtors, residence for 1 year, property is real estate, age 26, no other installment plans, housing in own, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

First, I need to create five different people fitting these. Let me think of different job roles for skilled employees. Maybe a mechanic, a lab technician, an IT technician, a construction supervisor, and a scientific research assistant. Each needs a unique scenario.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan (car for work purposes), their financial stability (steady job, existing credit paid back), and trustworthiness. Since they have a foreign worker status, maybe mention their legal status and commitment.

Let me start with the first person: a scientific research assistant. He's 26, works at a university, has a dependent, lives in own housing, has real estate. His existing credit is a student loan paid back. The car is needed for commuting to work. He's a foreign worker with a residence permit.

Second person: Automotive mechanic. He needs a car to reach his job sites. Maybe he works in a garage, has been employed for 11 months. His real estate is an apartment he bought recently. He has a sister as a dependent.

Third: IT support technician. Works for a tech company, needs a car for client visits. Lives in his own house, has a young child. Maybe he's from another country with a work visa.

Fourth: Construction site supervisor. Needs reliable transport for early morning shifts. Has a cousin dependent. Works for a construction firm.

Fifth: Public official, maybe a municipal office worker. Needs a car for commuting and work duties. Has a nephew dependent. Lives in a rented house but owns real estate elsewhere?

Wait, the profile says housing is own, so each person must own their housing. Also, present residence since 1 year, but they've been employed less than a year. Maybe they moved recently for work.

Each letter should mention the purpose clearly, their steady income, existing credit history, and why they can repay. Also, note that savings are low (<100 DM), so they can't save up, hence need the loan for the car.

Make sure each has a unique job, specific details, and personal circumstances. Avoid repetition. Check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter. Also, since they're foreign workers, maybe mention their legal status and employment stability.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are concise, specific, and meet all criteria.

**Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, 26, and I work as a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt. I have held this position for 11 months and earn a stable monthly salary of 2,800 DM. My checking account has maintained a minimum balance of 250 DM for over a year, and I have consistently repaid my existing student loan of 1,200 DM through this bank.  

I am applying for a 1,330 DM loan to purchase a used sedan to commute between my residence and the university laboratory. My dependent is my sister, who lives with me and contributes to household expenses. As a foreign worker with a valid residence permit, I prioritize financial responsibility. My employer has confirmed my contract renewal for another two years.  

I own a small apartment in Wiesbaden, purchased three years ago, and I have no other debts. The installment rate of 4 DM per month aligns with my budget. I kindly request your approval, confident in my ability to repay promptly.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Ahmed Mohamed

**Letter 2**  
Dear Bank Manager,  

I am Karim El-Sayed, 26, a certified automotive mechanic employed at TurboMechanics in Munich for 10 months. My monthly salary is 2,600 DM, with automatic deposits into my checking account (minimum 220 DM monthly). I have no existing debts beyond the 1,330 DM loan I previously repaid for my tools.  

This loan is essential to buy a reliable vehicle for transporting myself and tools to client sites. My dependent is my mother, who resides with me. Though my savings account holds only 80 DM, my stable income and 12-month employment history ensure timely repayments.  

I own a condominium in Leipzig and have lived there for one year. As a foreign worker with a work visa, I am committed to fulfilling my obligations. My employer confirms my performance and supports this request.  

Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Karim El-Sayed

**Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

My name is Rajesh Kumar, 26, and I work as an IT support technician for TechNova GmbH in Berlin. Employed for 11 months, I earn 2,900 DM monthly, with salary assignments processed through this bank. I have fully repaid a prior 1,000 DM equipment loan here.  

I seek a 1,330 DM loan to purchase a compact car for client site visits, as public transport is unreliable for my schedule. My daughter, aged 3, lives with me, and I allocate funds meticulously. My savings account currently has 50 DM, but my income covers all expenses with room for installments.  

I own a studio apartment in Dresden and have resided there for 14 months. As a foreign worker with a permanent residency card, I value financial integrity. My employer has assured my continued employment.  

I request your approval for this necessary investment.  
Gratefully,  
Rajesh Kumar

**Letter 4**  
Dear Bank Officer,  

I am Luis Fernandez, 26, a construction site supervisor for BauHaus Dresden. With 8 years of experience, I earn 2,700 DM monthly, deposited into my account for over a year. I have no outstanding debts except my current 1,330 DM housing-related credit here.  

This loan will fund a used van to commute early to construction sites and transport materials. My uncle, a dependent, resides with me and assists in household tasks. My savings account holds 30 DM, but my income remains steady.  

I own a duplex property in Leipzig, purchased by my family. As a foreign worker with a work permit, I have no intention of leaving Germany. My employer confirms my reliability and supports this application.  

Thank you for reviewing my case.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Fernandez

**Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am Nguyen Van Tuan, 26, a public official at the Hagen City Administration. Employed for 11 months, I receive 2,850 DM monthly, with salary assignments here for 13 months. I have fully repaid my prior 1,200 DM administrative fee loan.  

This loan is necessary to buy a car for official duties and commuting. My nephew, orphaned at 8, lives with me, and I manage expenses carefully. My savings account has 20 DM, but my income ensures repayment.  

I own a townhouse in Dortmund and have resided there for one year. As a foreign worker with a government-issued work visa, I am dedicated to fulfilling responsibilities. My employer guarantees job stability.  

I kindly ask for your approval.  
Respectfully,  
Nguyen Van Tuan
