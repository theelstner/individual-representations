Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

The profile mentions a foreign worker, male, single, 27 years old, with a savings account under 100 DM, existing checking account with 0-200 DM, 21 months old. Credit history is critical with other credits not at this bank. Purpose is business, credit amount 3652 DM. Employment since 4-7 years as a skilled employee or official. Installment rate 2, no other debtors, residence since 3 years, property like building society savings or life insurance, housing in own, two existing credits at this bank, dependents 1, no telephone.

First, I need to create five different people. Let me think of different job roles under skilled employee/official. Maybe a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a teacher, a nurse, and an IT technician. Each should have unique business purposes. Let me check the example given: the first example uses a scientific research assistant. I need to vary the jobs and business purposes.

For each person, I need to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their stable employment, existing credits, savings, residence, and how they'll repay.

Let me outline each person:

1. **Scientific Research Assistant** (as in the example) – maybe starting a lab supply business.
2. **Automotive Mechanic** – opening a repair shop.
3. **Public School Teacher** – starting an after-school tutoring service.
4. **Certified Nurse Assistant** – launching a home healthcare service.
5. **IT Support Technician** – starting a tech consulting firm.

Each should have specific details: name, job, employer, business idea, why trustworthy (stable job, existing credits managed well, residence, savings, etc.)

Now, for each letter, start with their name, address, date, bank details. Then explain their situation. Make sure to mention the loan amount, purpose, their current job (with specific name, like "Ludwig Müller, Automotive Mechanic at Berlin AutoCare since 2019"), duration of employment (5 years fits 4-7), savings (maybe 80 DM), residence since 3 years, existing credits (like a bike loan and phone bill), and how the business will generate income to repay.

Need to avoid formatting, keep it concise, proper ending with thanks and signature.

Check for each letter to ensure all profile attributes are covered with specific instances. Also, ensure no two letters are similar in structure or business purpose. Make sure each has unique numbers where applicable (e.g., different employment durations within 4-7 years, different savings amounts under 100 DM).

Let me start drafting each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
To the Management of [Bank Name],  
My name is Ahmed Khan, and I am a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute for Environmental Studies, where I have worked for 5 years. I am applying for a loan of 3,652 DM to establish a small lab supply business catering to local research facilities. Currently, I maintain a checking account with this bank, though my balance fluctuates between 0-200 DM due to irregular project funding. I have two existing credits here—a bicycle loan and a utility bill installment plan—which I consistently repay. My savings account holds 80 DM, and I own a life insurance policy. As a foreign worker residing in Germany for 3 years, I have a stable income of 2,200 DM monthly, with 2 DM allocated to loan installments. My wife and I live in our own apartment, and I am confident this venture will generate revenue to repay the loan. I kindly request your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Khan
