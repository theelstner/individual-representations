Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required elements.

First, the profile details are: no checking account, 15 months duration, good credit history, purpose is education, loan amount 4623 DM, savings between 100-500 DM, employment since 1-4 years (so I need to pick specific numbers like 2 years), single male, no other debtors, residence since 2 years, property is building society savings or life insurance, age 40, no other installment plans, own housing, one existing credit at the bank, job in management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/officer, one dependent, has a telephone, and foreign worker registered under their name.

Each letter needs to be concise, from a different person, with specific instances. Let me think of different job roles from the job category: management could be a project manager, self-employed like a consultant, highly qualified employee like a scientific research assistant, officer could be a public sector officer, maybe a school principal? Wait, the example given in the user's instruction was "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee". So I need to vary the jobs within the given categories.

Let me list possible jobs: project manager, IT consultant (self-employed), scientific research assistant, school principal (if officer counts), maybe a hospital department head? Or a business owner? Let me check the job category again: management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/office. So maybe:

1. Project Manager (Management)
2. IT Consultant (Self-Employed)
3. Scientific Research Assistant (Highly Qualified Employee)
4. School Principal (Officer)
5. Small Business Owner (Self-Employed?)

Wait, the profile says "Job:management/ self-employed/ highly qualified employee/ officer". So five options. Let me pick one from each category:

1. Management: Project Manager at a construction company
2. Self-Employed: IT Consultant
3. Highly Qualified Employee: Scientific Research Assistant
4. Officer: School Principal
5. Maybe another category? Let me check again. The job is in one of those four, so each letter should have a different one. So five letters, but the job categories are four. Maybe one of them can have two different roles in the same category? Or perhaps one of the categories can have two variations. For example, two different self-employed jobs? But the user wants each letter from a different person with different attributes. Let me see.

Wait, the user says "different person that could be described in the following profile". So each person can have different roles within the job categories. Let me proceed.

For each letter, I need to:

- Specify the job with a concrete example (e.g., project manager, IT consultant, etc.)
- Mention the duration in the job (since present employment is 1-4 years, pick specific like 2 years)
- The purpose is education, so each person is applying for education. Need to specify what education (e.g., courses, certifications, further studies)
- They have existing credit paid back duly, so mention that
- Savings between 100-500 DM, so maybe 200 DM, 300 DM, etc.
- Age 40, residence since 2 years, dependents 1, own housing, etc.

Also, each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation (including savings, existing credit, employment), and why they're trustworthy (good credit history, stable job, etc.)

Let me start drafting each letter.

First person: Project Manager in construction, 2 years in job, applying for a project management certification to advance career. Savings 300 DM. Existing credit for a car paid back. Trustworthy because of timely payments, stable income.

Second: IT Consultant self-employed for 3 years, wants to take a cybersecurity course. Savings 200 DM. Has a good credit history. Trustworthy due to steady clients and income.

Third: Scientific Research Assistant with 8 years experience (wait, the profile says present employment since 1-4 years. So maybe they have 8 years in the field but current job is 2 years? Wait, the profile says "Present employment since:1 <= ... < 4 years", so current job duration is between 1-4 years. So each person's current job is 1-4 years. So for the scientific research assistant, maybe they've been in their current position for 3 years. Their purpose is education, maybe a master's degree in environmental science. Savings 400 DM. Trustworthy because of consistent payments and stable employment.

Fourth: School Principal (Officer) who has been in position for 2 years. Applying for an educational leadership program. Savings 250 DM. Has a good credit history. Trustworthy because of stable government job and timely payments.

Fifth: Maybe a small business owner, self-employed, running a bakery for 3 years. Wants to attend a food safety and management course. Savings 150 DM. Trustworthy due to successful business and existing credit repayment.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. But since the user says not to use formatting, maybe just the content. Wait, the user says "do not use any formatting on the letter", so no bold, italics, etc. But the letters should have the structure of a motivation letter. However, the user example in the previous response didn't include addresses, just the body. Let me check the user's instruction: "Write 5 motivation letters... Each letter should be written from the perspective of a different person... Keep the letters short and concise. Do not cut off the letter - be sure to write a proper ending!"

So probably each letter is just the body, not the full formal letter with addresses. So start with a greeting, then the content, then a closing.

Each letter should explain purpose (education, specific course), financial situation (savings, employment duration, existing credit), and trustworthiness (credit history, stable job).

Now, let me draft each one with specific details.

First Letter: Project Manager

Name: Thomas Müller

Purpose: Project Management Certification (PMI)

Savings: 300 DM

Employment: 2 years as Project Manager at a construction firm

Existing credit: Paid back car loan

Second Letter: IT Consultant

Name: Lars Schmidt

Purpose: Cybersecurity Course

Savings: 200 DM

Employment: Self-employed IT consultant for 3 years

Existing credit: Paid back software purchase loan

Third Letter: Scientific Research Assistant

Name: Dr. Anna Weber

Purpose: Master's in Environmental Science

Savings: 400 DM

Employment: Research assistant at a university, 3 years

Fourth Letter: School Principal

Name: Michael Fischer

Purpose: Educational Leadership Program

Savings: 250 DM

Employment: School principal for 2 years

Fifth Letter: Small Business Owner (Bakery)

Name: Stefan Becker

Purpose: Food Safety and Management Course

Savings: 150 DM

Employment: Bakery owner for 3 years

Each letter should mention age 40, residence since 2 years, one dependent, own housing, telephone, foreign worker registered.

Make sure each letter is concise, maybe 4-5 paragraphs. Let me write them out.
