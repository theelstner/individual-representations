Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required elements.

First, the profile details are: no checking account, 24 months duration, credit history with existing credits paid back, purpose is retraining, credit amount 937, savings less than 100 DM, present employment less than a year, installment rate 4, male, married/widowed, no other debtors, residence since 3 years, property like a car, age 27, no other installment plans, own housing, two existing credits at the bank, job as unskilled resident, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be from a different person. Let me think of five distinct scenarios. Maybe different countries of origin, different jobs (even though the profile says unskilled, but maybe different types?), different reasons for retraining. Also, need to specify the generic attributes with concrete examples.

Let me start with the first person. Let's say he's from the Philippines, works as a manual laborer, wants to retrain as an electrician. He's been in his current job for less than a year but has a stable residence for 3 years. He has a car. He's married with one child. He has no savings but has paid back previous loans. He emphasizes his stable housing and commitment to repay.

Second person could be from Mexico, working as a farmworker, wants to retrain in mechanics. He's been in the country for a while, has two existing loans with the bank, and is determined to improve his skills for better employment. He mentions his own housing and responsibility towards his dependent.

Third person might be from Vietnam, working in construction, seeking retraining in plumbing. He has a car, has a good credit history, and is motivated to support his family. He might mention his residence stability and previous loan repayments.

Fourth person could be from Nigeria, working as a warehouse assistant, aiming for a logistics course. He has a car, stable housing, and is focused on career growth. He might highlight his punctual repayments and the necessity of the loan for his family's future.

Fifth person from India, working in hospitality as an unskilled worker, wants to retrain in IT. He's been in the country for three years, has a car, and is determined to provide for his child. He emphasizes his past credit responsibility and the importance of the retraining.

I need to make sure each letter includes all the profile points: no checking account, 24 months, credit history, retraining purpose, 937 DM, savings <100 DM, employment <1 year, installment rate 4, married/widowed, no debtors, residence 3 years, property (car), age 27, no other plans, own housing, two credits at bank, unskilled job, one dependent, no phone, foreign worker.

Each letter should start with the applicant's name, address, date, bank address. Then a subject line. The body should explain the purpose, financial situation, why trustworthy. Need to mention the specific job titles, countries, and other specifics. Make sure each is unique but fits the profile.

Let me check for each letter if all elements are covered. For example, in the first letter, the person is from the Philippines, manual laborer, retraining as electrician, has a car, married with one child, two existing credits, residence 3 years, etc. Each letter should have these specifics but vary the details.

Avoid using any formatting, keep them short, proper ending with name and signature. Make sure the letters are concise but cover all necessary points. Also, ensure that the trustworthiness is highlighted through past repayment, stable residence, own housing, and commitment to the retraining.

Subject: Application for Loan Approval  

I am writing to request a loan of 937 DM to fund my retraining as an electrician. Currently working as a manual laborer in a construction site, I have been employed for eight months. Though my job is unskilled, I am committed to advancing my career through vocational training, which will allow me to secure higher wages and better support my wife and young son.  

I have no checking account but maintain a savings bond of 80 DM. I reside in my own apartment in Madrid for the past three years and own a used car for daily commuting. As a foreign worker from the Philippines, I have diligently repaid two previous loans with your bank totaling 1,200 DM. My monthly installment capacity is 4 DM, and I am confident my stable housing and growing income prospects will ensure timely repayment.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to contributing to your institution’s trust through responsible financial management.

Mr. Juan Ramirez  
Avenida Central 22, Guadalajara

Subject: Request for Retraining Loan  

I am applying for a 937 DM loan to enroll in a certified mechanics course. Having worked as a farmworker in Spain for 11 months, I aim to transition into automotive repair, a field with better opportunities. My savings are minimal (90 DM in a bond), but I have no debts beyond the two small loans I already repaid to your bank.  

I live in my own home in Guadalajara, where I’ve resided for three years, and own a motorcycle. Though I lack a checking account, my punctual repayment history reflects my reliability. My wife and I have one child, and I am determined to provide stable income through this retraining. With my current job’s low wages, upgrading my skills is essential.  

I assure you of my commitment to repaying 4 DM monthly. Thank you for your trust.  

Yours faithfully,  
Juan Ramirez
