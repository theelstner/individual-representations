Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile has specific attributes: checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM, duration of 18 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is a new car, credit amount 5866 DM. Savings account between 100-500 DM. Employment duration 1-4 years. Single male, no other debtors, residence since 2 years, property is car or other, age 30, no other installment plans, housing is own, 2 existing credits at the bank, job is skilled employee or official, 1 dependent, has a telephone, foreign worker registered.

First, I need to create five different people with specific instances. Let me think of different jobs within "skilled employee / official". Maybe a mechanic, a teacher, a lab technician, a civil servant, and a chef. Each should have unique details but fit the profile.

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Let me outline each person:

1. **Mechanic**: Let's say he's a car mechanic. He wants a new car for work efficiency. He's been employed at a garage for 3 years. Has savings of 300 DM. His current car is old, affecting his work. Trustworthy because he's paid past credits and has a stable job.

2. **Science Research Assistant**: Maybe a lab tech in a university. Needs a reliable car for commuting long distances. Employed for 2.5 years. Savings 250 DM. Trustworthy due to timely payments and steady income.

3. **Civil Servant**: A municipal office worker. Needs a car for official duties and family. Employed for 3 years. Savings 400 DM. Has a stable government job, making him a reliable candidate.

4. **Restaurant Chef**: Works at a local restaurant. Needs a van for transporting supplies. Employed for 2 years. Savings 150 DM. Has a good credit history and owns a small property.

5. **IT Support Technician**: Works for a tech company. Needs a car for client visits. Employed for 1.5 years. Savings 350 DM. Has a dependable job and timely credit payments.

Now, each letter should include specific numbers and details from the profile. Make sure to mention checking account duration (18 months), existing credits (2), savings amount, employment duration, residence since 2 years, etc. Also, mention the installment rate of 2, but maybe phrase it as a manageable monthly payment. They all have one dependent, own housing, and have a phone.

Check that each letter is concise, starts with their name and address, date, bank address, and proper closing. Avoid formatting, just plain text. Make sure each person's situation is unique but fits the profile. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all profile attributes are included with specific examples.

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,866 DM to purchase a new car. As a certified automotive mechanic employed at Westside Garage for 3 years, I require a reliable vehicle to efficiently service clients and transport equipment. My current car, a 10-year-old model, frequently breaks down, delaying my work and affecting my income.  

I have maintained a checking account for 18 months with a stable balance between 0–200 DM and have consistently repaid two existing loans at this bank (a bicycle loan and a home repair credit). My savings account holds 300 DM, and I have resided at my current address for 2 years. Employed full-time since 2020, I earn a monthly salary of 2,200 DM, with 400 DM allocated to loan installments.  

As a responsible borrower with no late payments, I assure timely repayment. My stable job, ownership of a condominium, and a dependent family member (my mother) further underscore my commitment to financial responsibility. I look forward to your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 5,866 DM loan to purchase a new car for my role as a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin. My current vehicle, a 12-year-old sedan, cannot reliably transport lab samples between sites, risking my 2.5-year-old daughter’s daycare drop-offs and work deadlines.  

I have paid back two prior loans (a laptop and furniture credit) and maintain a 18-month checking account with a balance of 150 DM. My savings account holds 250 DM, and I’ve worked at the university since 2021, earning 2,400 DM monthly. I allocate 450 DM monthly for this loan, with stable housing in my own apartment.  

As a single mother prioritizing my child’s stability, I am committed to repaying this loan. My job, savings, and punctual credit history confirm my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Weber

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I request a 5,866 DM loan for a new car to support my role as a municipal IT technician. My aging van, used for installing city infrastructure software, requires frequent repairs, costing 300 DM monthly. A reliable vehicle will improve service delivery and reduce expenses.  

I have a 18-month checking account with 50 DM and a savings account of 400 DM. Since 2020, I’ve worked at the City of Munich’s IT department, earning 2,600 DM monthly. I’ve repaid two loans (a computer and travel credit) and reside at my current home for 2 years.  

My stable civil service job, ownership of a condominium, and 1 dependent (my sister) reflect my financial responsibility. I propose a 350 DM monthly installment, which I can manage comfortably. I trust you will approve this loan.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Fischer

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I need a 5,866 DM loan for a new car to serve clients as a freelance IT support technician. My current car, a 9-year-old model, lacks the space to carry servers and tools, delaying repairs for small businesses. A newer vehicle will boost my income and client satisfaction.  

I’ve worked at Tech Solutions GmbH since 2021, earning 2,100 DM monthly. My checking account has been active for 18 months with a balance of 120 DM, and my savings account holds 350 DM. I’ve repaid two loans (a smartphone and home appliance credit) and own a studio apartment.  

With one dependent (my nephew) and a stable job, I am committed to repaying this loan. My 350 DM monthly installment is feasible, and my punctual credit history proves my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Jan Schulz
