Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account with less than 0 DM, so the person might be in a tight spot financially. The duration of the checking account is 18 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is a new car, credit amount 2249 DM. Savings account between 100-500 DM. Employment duration 4-7 years. Installment rate 4. Single male, no other debtors. Residence since 3 years. Property: car or other. Age 30. No other installment plans. Housing: own. One existing credit at the bank. Job in management, self-employed, or highly qualified employee. Two dependents. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

So each letter needs to be from a different person. Let me brainstorm different job roles: scientific research assistant, management trainee, IT project manager, self-employed consultant, maybe a teacher or something else. Let me pick five distinct jobs.

First person: Scientific research assistant with 8 years of experience. Let's say at a university. They need a car for commuting to work and taking care of their family. They have a savings account of 300 DM. They mention paying back previous credits on time.

Second person: Management trainee at a manufacturing company, 5 years employed. Needs a car for work-related travel. Savings of 400 DM. Trustworthy because of timely payments.

Third person: IT project manager with 6 years at a software firm. Car needed for client meetings. Savings 200 DM. Stable job, responsible with past loans.

Fourth person: Self-employed consultant, 5 years in business. Car for client visits. Savings 150 DM. Regular payments on existing credit.

Fifth person: Officer in a government agency, 4 years. Car for family and work. Savings 500 DM. Dependents, own housing.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then explain their situation, why they need the loan, their financial stability, and trustworthiness. Make sure each has specific details. Avoid generic terms. Keep letters concise, not too long. End with a proper closing.

Check for each profile attribute: checking account negative, duration 18 months, credit history good, purpose car, amount 2249, savings 100-500, employment 4-7 years, installment rate 4, single male, no debtors, residence 3 years, property car or other, age 30, no other plans, housing own, one credit at bank, job category as specified, two dependents, telephone yes, foreign worker registered.

Need to make sure each letter includes these elements in a natural way. For example, mentioning the existing credit at the bank that was paid back, current job duration, savings amount, residence duration, etc.

Let me draft each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered with specific instances.

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to request a loan of 2249 DM to purchase a new car. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich with eight years of experience, I require reliable transportation to commute between campus and my residence, which is 45 kilometers apart. My current checking account is temporarily negative due to recent medical expenses for my mother, but I have maintained a savings account with 300 DM at this bank.  

I have been employed at the university for five years, earning a stable monthly income of 3200 DM. My existing credit for laboratory equipment was repaid in full over 18 months, demonstrating my commitment to timely payments. I reside in my own apartment in Garching for the past three years and have two dependents. My job provides a solid income, and I am registered as a foreign worker in compliance with all legal requirements.  

I assure you of my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM monthly. Your support will enable me to focus on my work while ensuring family needs are met. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,

Dear Sirs,  

I am applying for a 2249 DM loan to replace my aging car, which is essential for my role as a management trainee at Bayer AG. With six years in this position, I frequently travel between regional offices, and a reliable vehicle is critical for client meetings. My savings account currently holds 400 DM, though my checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to home maintenance costs.  

I have repaid my previous credit for office software without delay, and my stable salary of 3800 DM covers monthly expenses. I live in my own apartment in Leverkusen for three years and support my two children. My employment and residence stability, combined with a registered foreign worker status, underscore my reliability.  

The installment rate of 4 DM aligns with my budget, and I am confident in fulfilling repayment terms. Your trust would greatly assist my professional responsibilities.  

Respectfully,  
[Your Name]

To Whom It May Concern,  

As an IT project manager at SAP SE for six years, I need a new car to attend client sites across Stuttgart. My current vehicle’s repair costs exceed its value, and my savings account has 200 DM. My checking account is temporarily negative due to my father’s medical bills, but my income of 4200 DM ensures timely repayment.  

I have consistently repaid my existing credit for software licenses, and my 18-month employment history with SAP confirms job stability. I reside in my own home in Mannheim for three years, have two dependents, and am registered as a foreign worker. The 4 DM installment rate is feasible within my budget.  

This loan will enhance my productivity and family mobility. Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,
