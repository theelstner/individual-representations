Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. First, I need to parse the profile carefully to make sure I include all specific details.

The profile mentions a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM, duration of 36 months. Credit history is good, with existing credits paid back. The purpose is education, credit amount 12,612 DM. Savings account is 100-500 DM. Employment duration 1-4 years. Single male, no dependents? Wait, no, dependents are 2. Housing is for free, meaning maybe they live with someone. Job is skilled employee or official. Age 47. Also, foreign worker registered under their name.

Wait, the profile says "Personal status and sex: male: single" but dependents are 2. That might be a conflict. Maybe the person is single but has two dependents, perhaps children? Need to clarify that in the letters. Also, housing is "for free," which might mean they live with family or have some arrangement where they don't pay rent. 

Each letter needs to be from a different person. So I need to create five distinct scenarios but all fitting the profile. Let me think of different roles within the job category (skilled employee/official). Maybe a laboratory technician, a public administration officer, a machinery operator, a quality control inspector, and a technical draftsman. Each with different specifics.

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying for the loan (education purpose), their financial situation (checking account, savings, employment), and why they're trustworthy (credit history, existing credit paid back, etc.). Also, mention the dependents, housing, and other profile attributes.

Need to make sure each letter is concise, doesn't cut off, and has a proper ending. Avoid formatting. Let me start drafting each one step by step, ensuring all the specific numbers and attributes are included without being generic. For example, instead of saying "skilled employee," use specific job titles. Also, the credit amount is fixed at 12,612 DM, so each letter should mention that exact figure. 

Check for each profile attribute in every letter. For example, the duration in months is 36, so the checking account has been active for 36 months. The person has been employed for between 1-4 years, so pick specific numbers like 2 years, 3 years, etc. Savings account between 100-500 DM, so maybe 300 DM, 450 DM, etc. 

Also, the purpose is education. Each person might have different educational goals: further education, vocational training, certification courses, etc. Maybe one is for his own education, another for a child's education? But the profile says dependents are 2, so maybe the person has two children and needs funds for their education. Wait, the purpose is education, but the profile says "education" as the purpose. So the loan is for education, which could be the applicant's or someone else's. Need to clarify that in each letter.

Also, the person is single, male, with two dependents. So maybe the dependents are children. So the education could be for their children. Or maybe the applicant is pursuing education to advance his career, which would help support the family. Each letter can have a different angle here.

Need to make sure that each letter is unique in terms of the person's situation but still fits the profile. Let me outline each letter:

1. Laboratory technician wanting vocational training to advance career, enabling better income to support family. Checking account: 150 DM, savings 300 DM, employed 2 years, 36 months checking account, etc.

2. Public administration officer seeking certification to transition into a higher-paying role. Savings 450 DM, employed 3 years, etc.

3. Machinery operator needing funds for his son's technical education. His own job is stable, but the loan is for the dependent. Maybe his savings are 200 DM, employed 1.5 years.

Wait, but the purpose is education. The profile says the purpose is education, so the loan is for education. So maybe each applicant is applying for their own education or their dependents'. Need to make that clear.

Also, the existing credit is paid back duly. Each applicant has an existing credit with the bank, which they've paid back. So mention that in each letter.

Housing is "for free," which might mean they don't pay rent. So perhaps they live with family. Maybe mention that they have support from family, reducing housing costs, allowing them to manage loan payments.

Each letter should start with the applicant's name, address, date, bank name, then the body. The body should explain their situation, why they need the loan, their ability to repay, and their trustworthiness.

Need to avoid generic terms. Instead of "skilled employee," use specific roles. Also, the foreign worker is registered under their name. Maybe they are a registered foreign worker in Germany, which could be a point about their legal status and stability.

Let me start drafting each letter with these points in mind, ensuring all attributes are covered and each is unique.
