Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the details.

First, the profile says the person doesn't have a checking account. They've been at their job for 1 to 4 years, but the profile mentions "Present employment since: 1 <= ... < 4 years." Wait, the job is listed as "unskilled - resident," but in the example, it's "scientific research assistant." Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Wait, the job in the profile is "unskilled - resident," but the example uses a skilled job. Maybe I need to reconcile that. Let me check the original profile again. Oh, the job is "unskilled - resident," so I need to make sure the jobs in the letters are unskilled. The example might have been a mistake. So I need to use unskilled jobs like factory worker, cleaner, etc.

The purpose of the loan is retraining. The credit amount is 3447 DM. Savings account between 500-1000 DM. The person is female, divorced/separated/married, has two dependents, owns real estate, lives in their own housing, has no other credits except one at the bank paid back duly, no other installment plans, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

Each letter needs to be from a different person with specific instances. Let me think of different scenarios. Let's vary the jobs (all unskilled), reasons for retraining, maybe different countries they're from, how long they've been in Germany, etc. Each should explain their financial situation, why they need the loan, and why they're trustworthy.

First person: Maybe a cleaner who wants to become a medical assistant. She's been working in Germany for a few years, has a stable job, owns a house. She has savings, no other debts, and has a good credit history with the bank.

Second person: A factory worker looking to retrain as a warehouse supervisor. She has dependents, owns property, and has a good track record with the bank.

Third person: Maybe a hotel cleaner aiming to retrain in hospitality management. She's been employed for 2 years, has savings, and is a foreign worker.

Fourth person: A construction worker wanting to become a project coordinator. She's separated, has two kids, owns a home, and has a good credit history.

Fifth person: A retail worker aiming to retrain as a store manager. She's been in Germany for 3 years, has savings, and is a foreign worker with a stable job.

I need to make sure each letter includes specific numbers: 3447 DM loan, 4 DM installment rate, 3 years residence, 1 existing credit paid back, savings between 500-1000 DM, etc. Also, mention no checking account but they have a savings account. Each letter should be concise, not too long, and end properly.

Let me start drafting the first letter. The person is a cleaner, 35 years old, foreign worker, married with two kids, owns a house. She's been working as a cleaner for 2 years, wants to retrain as a medical assistant. She has 700 DM in savings, one credit paid back, no other debts. She explains her need for the loan, her stable job, and trustworthiness.

Second letter: Factory worker, 35, separated, two dependents. Worked at a factory for 3 years, wants to retrain as a warehouse supervisor. Has 600 DM savings, owns property. Emphasizes her responsibility and repayment history.

Third letter: Hotel cleaner, 35, married, two kids. Worked in Germany for 2 years, wants to retrain in hospitality management. Has 800 DM savings, owns a home. Highlights her dedication and financial stability.

Fourth letter: Construction worker, 35, divorced, two children. Employed for 3 years, wants to become a project coordinator. 500 DM savings, owns real estate. Stresses her commitment and ability to repay.

Fifth letter: Retail worker, 35, married, two dependents. Worked in retail for 2 years, wants to retrain as a store manager. 900 DM savings, owns a house. Focuses on her career growth and financial responsibility.

Each letter should start with the applicant's details, state the purpose, financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Avoid formatting, keep it short. Make sure each has unique specifics. Let me check if all profile attributes are covered in each letter: checking account status, duration (12 months?), credit history, purpose, amount, savings, employment duration, personal status, dependents, property, etc. Also, the installment rate is 4 DM, but maybe that's the bank's info, not the applicant's. The applicant's part is to mention the loan amount and their ability to pay.

I need to ensure that each letter is distinct but adheres to the profile. Let me proceed to write each one step by step, making sure all the points are addressed without being too verbose.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Maria Gonzalez, and I am writing to request a loan of 3447 DM to fund my retraining as a medical assistant. I have worked as a cleaner in Germany for the past two years and currently earn a stable income. Although I do not have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with 700 DM. I own a small apartment and have lived in my current residence for three years.  

I am a divorced mother of two and take my responsibilities seriously. My only existing credit with your bank—a personal loan for 2000 DM—was repaid in full six months ago. Retraining is essential for me to secure better employment and provide a brighter future for my children. I assure you that I will manage this loan responsibly, given my steady work history and commitment to financial stability. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,
