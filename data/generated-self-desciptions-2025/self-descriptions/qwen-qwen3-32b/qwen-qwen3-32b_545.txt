Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account with at least 200 DM and salary assignments for at least one year. The loan duration is 18 months, credit history shows existing credits paid back duly, purpose is furniture/equipment, amount 2864 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Present employment since 1 to 4 years. Installment rate 2. Male, single, no other debtors/guarantors. Residence since 1 year. Property: real estate. Age 34. No other installment plans. Housing: own. One existing credit at the bank. Job: unskilled - resident. Dependents: 2. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

I need to create five different people. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different nationalities, jobs, reasons for needing furniture. Let me start with the first one.

First person: Let's say he's from India, works as a warehouse helper. He's been employed for 2.5 years. He wants to buy a sofa and dining set for his family. He has a real estate property as collateral. He's a foreign worker, so maybe he mentions his legal status. He has dependents, so he needs the furniture for their comfort. He has a good credit history, so he emphasizes that. No savings, but steady income.

Second person: Maybe from the Philippines, working as a janitor. Employed for 3 years. Needs a bed and wardrobe for his children. He's a foreign worker, has been in the country for a while. Owns property. No other debts. Emphasizes timely payments on existing credit.

Third person: From Mexico, working as a security guard. Employed for 2 years. Needs kitchen equipment. He's a foreign worker, has a real estate, single, two dependents. No savings but steady salary.

Fourth person: From Vietnam, working as a cleaner. Employed for 1.5 years. Needs to buy a sofa. Has real estate, no other debts. Highlights his punctual payments for existing loans.

Fifth person: From Nigeria, working as a maintenance worker. Employed for 3.5 years. Needs furniture for a new room. Owns property, two dependents. Emphasizes his stable job and good credit history.

Each letter should be concise, mention all the key points from the profile with specific numbers and roles. Make sure each has a unique job and slight different purpose for the loan. Also, mention being a foreign worker, own property, single with two dependents, no savings, existing credit paid back, etc.

Check for each letter: Name, job, employment duration, purpose, dependents, property, credit history, foreign worker status, no telephone, existing credit at the bank. Avoid any formatting, keep it short. End with a proper closing.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered without repetition.

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Rajesh Kumar, and I am a warehouse helper at LogiTech GmbH, where I have worked for 2.5 years. I am writing to apply for a loan of 2864 DM to purchase a new sofa and dining set for my family. Currently, my household includes my wife and 6-year-old daughter, and our furniture is worn beyond repair.  

I have maintained a checking account with your bank for over a year and consistently paid my salary into it. My existing credit for a refrigerator was repaid in full six months ago. Though my savings account holds less than 100 DM, I own a real estate property in Dresden and reside there with my family. As a foreign worker with a valid residence permit, I prioritize financial responsibility and have no other debts. My monthly installment rate of 2 DM for the proposed loan aligns with my stable income.  

I kindly request your approval, confident in my ability to repay promptly. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Sir or Madam  

I am Miguel Ortega, a janitor at the Berlin Central Hospital, employed there for 3 years. I seek a loan of 2864 DM to furnish my children’s bedrooms with new beds and wardrobes. My son is 8, and my daughter is 5, and their current furniture is unsuitable for their needs.  

I have held a checking account with your bank for 14 months and have never defaulted on salary deposits. My prior credit for a bicycle was repaid in full last year. While my savings account contains 80 DM, I own a property in Leipzig and live there with my family. As a foreign worker from Mexico, I have no other debts or installment plans. My monthly repayment capacity is secure, given my steady income.  

I assure you of timely payments and appreciate your trust. Thank you for reviewing my application.  

Respectfully  
Miguel Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Tariq Hassan, and I work as a security guard at the Frankfurt Industrial Park, a position I’ve held for 2 years. I apply for a loan of 2864 DM to replace our outdated kitchen equipment, which is essential for feeding my two young children, aged 4 and 7.  

I have a checking account with your bank and have diligently deposited my salary for the past 13 months. My previous credit for a television was repaid without issue. Though my savings are minimal (45 DM), I own real estate in Munich and reside there. As a foreign worker from Pakistan, I have no additional debts and no telephone, but I prioritize my family’s well-being. My income ensures I can manage the 2 DM monthly installment comfortably.  

Thank you for your time. I am committed to fulfilling my obligations.  

Yours faithfully  
Tariq Hassan
