Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required elements.

First, the profile details: The applicant has a checking account with at least 200 DM and a salary assigned for at least a year. The loan duration is 4 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is a new car, credit amount 1494. Savings account is unknown or none. Present employment is less than a year. Installment rate is 1. Male, single, no other debtors. Residence since 2 years. Property is real estate. Age 29. No other installment plans. Housing is own. One existing credit at the bank. Job is unskilled-resident. Dependents: 2. No telephone. Not a foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I should vary the specific instances. Let me think of different scenarios for each person. For example, different jobs (even though the profile says unskilled, maybe different types?), different reasons for the car, different real estate situations, etc.

First person: Maybe a delivery driver who needs a reliable car for work. He's been in his job for 8 months (since employment is less than a year). He has a small apartment but owns real estate, maybe a property he inherited. Dependents are his sister and her child. He's responsible with past loans.

Second person: A self-employed handyman. He needs a van for his business. He's been in his current job for 10 months. Lives in his family home. Dependents are his parents. Emphasize timely payments on past credits.

Third person: A farmer needing a tractor. Though unskilled, maybe he's a farm laborer. Lives on his family's land. Dependents are his children. Needs the car for farm logistics.

Fourth person: A technician assistant. He needs a car for commuting to a new job. Moved recently but has stable income. Real estate is his parents' house. Dependents are his daughter and wife (wait, profile says single, so maybe just his daughter? Or maybe he's single with two kids? Need to check. The profile says dependents: 2. Personal status: male single. So maybe two children from a previous relationship.)

Fifth person: A warehouse worker needing a car for longer shifts. Lives in a house owned by his family. Dependents are his elderly parents. Highlight his responsibility and past credit history.

I need to make sure each letter includes the checking account status, employment duration, credit history, purpose, amount, savings (none), residence, property, age, housing, existing credit, job specifics, dependents. Also, why they're trustworthy: timely payments, stable income, real estate as security.

Avoid generic terms. Use specific numbers: e.g., "8 months in my current role as a delivery driver," "paid back my previous loan for tools in full," etc. Each letter should have a unique scenario but fit the profile. Also, ensure the letters are concise, not too long, and properly end with a sign-off.

Let me start drafting each one, making sure to vary the jobs and reasons for the loan. Check that each has all required elements and specific details. Also, check that the tone is respectful and persuasive, explaining why they need the loan and why they're reliable.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to request a loan of 1494 DM to purchase a reliable vehicle for my work as a delivery driver. At 29 years old, I have been employed at a logistics company for 8 months, earning a stable monthly salary of 1200 DM, which I have assigned to my checking account for over a year. Though I recently transitioned from a warehouse job, my income remains consistent. I reside in my family’s real estate property, having lived there for 2 years, and I currently own a 10-year-old car that requires frequent repairs. This loan will allow me to invest in a newer vehicle to improve my work efficiency and reduce maintenance costs. I have a history of repaying past credits responsibly, including a 500 DM tool purchase loan settled in full 6 months ago. With two dependents—my sister and her child—I prioritize financial responsibility. I kindly ask for your trust in my ability to meet monthly installments promptly.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Markus Reinhardt

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 1494 DM loan to buy a used car, essential for expanding my self-employed handyman business. For the past 10 months, I’ve worked as a residential contractor, earning 1100 DM monthly, which I deposit into my checking account. While my current job is new, I previously worked in construction for 3 years, and my stable income ensures timely repayments. I reside in my parents’ home, which they own as real estate, and have lived there for 2 years. My existing credit—a 700 DM equipment loan—was repaid in full last year. This vehicle will enable me to transport tools and materials, increasing my client base. Though I lack savings, my commitment to responsibility is unwavering, supported by my two dependents: my elderly father and a younger cousin. I assure you of punctual installments and appreciate your support.  

Thank you.  
Respectfully,  
Lars Müller

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a 1494 DM loan to purchase a car for my role as a farm laborer at Green Valley Farms, where I’ve worked for 9 months. My salary of 1050 DM is deposited monthly into my checking account, which I’ve maintained for 14 months. I own no savings account but have consistently paid rent and utilities without issue. My family’s real estate, a farmhouse I’ve resided in for 2 years, serves as collateral. The loan will replace my aging motorcycle, which is unsafe for long commutes and transporting seasonal produce. I have a history of repaying debts, including a 600 DM tractor repair loan settled 18 months ago. Supporting my two young children, I treat financial obligations seriously. I kindly request approval for this critical investment.  

Gratefully,  
Thomas Weber

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I request a 1494 DM loan to buy a vehicle for my job as a technical assistant at a manufacturing plant, a position I’ve held for 7 months. My monthly salary of 1150 DM is assigned to my checking account, and I have no savings account. I reside in my uncle’s real estate property, where I’ve lived for 2 years, and own no other assets. This car will ensure punctuality for my 5 AM shifts and reduce transportation costs. My existing credit—a 450 DM machinery loan—was repaid in full 10 months ago. I have two dependents: my daughter, aged 6, and my mother, who relies on me for care. My employment history includes 4 years as a factory worker, and I am committed to fulfilling this loan’s terms. Your support would mean stability for my family.  

Sincerely,  
Jan Schmidt

**Motivation Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a 1494 DM loan to purchase a car for my work as a nightshift warehouse supervisor, a role I’ve held for 8 months. My salary of 1250 DM is deposited monthly into my checking account, which I’ve maintained for 13 months. I reside in my family’s real estate home, where I’ve lived for 2 years, and have no savings. The loan will replace my unreliable 15-year-old car, ensuring I can commute to late-night shifts without disruption. I have a strong credit history, having repaid a 300 DM emergency loan last year. I support my two nephews, who live with me after their parents’ passing, and managing their needs has taught me discipline in financial matters. I assure you of timely payments and appreciate your consideration.  

Thank you.  
Respectfully,  
André Fischer
