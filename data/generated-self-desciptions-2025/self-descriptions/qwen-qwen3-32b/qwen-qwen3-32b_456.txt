Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the requirements.

First, the profile details include a checking account balance under 0 DM, a 24-month duration. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is a new car, credit amount 4817 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Employment duration between 4-7 years. Installment rate 2. Male, single, with a co-applicant. Residence since 3 months. Property: building society savings or life insurance. Age 31. No other installment plans. Own housing. One existing credit at the bank. Job as skilled employee or official. One dependent. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

I need to create five different people. Let me think of different jobs that fit "skilled employee / official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, a civil servant, an IT technician, a teacher, and a mechanic. Each should have unique details.

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying for the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. I need to invent specific instances. Let's start with the first one: a scientific research assistant. He's 31, has been working at a university for 5 years. His checking account is negative due to recent lab equipment purchase. He has a co-applicant, maybe a sibling. He's paid back previous loans. His residence is 3 months because he moved for the job. He has a building society savings. He needs the car for commuting to work, which is essential for his research. Trustworthy because of his stable job and good credit history.

Second person: a civil servant. Let's say a municipal administrative officer. 6 years at the local government. Negative checking account from helping a family member financially. Savings under 100 DM. Co-applicant is his sister. Needs a car for daily commute and to visit clients. Trustworthy due to stable government job and punctual repayments.

Third: IT technician. Worked at a company for 4 years. Negative balance from a friend's emergency. Car needed for client visits. Co-applicant is his girlfriend. Stable income, timely payments. Owns a house. Has a building society agreement.

Fourth: primary school teacher. 5 years in the job. Checking account negative due to renovation costs. Needs a car for commuting and transporting students on field trips. Co-applicant is his mother. Trustworthy because of stable teaching job and good credit history.

Fifth: automotive mechanic. 6 years at a garage. Negative account from buying tools. Needs a car for work-related travel and customer pickups. Co-applicant is his brother. Stable income, owns home, has savings agreement.

Now, each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then the body explaining their situation, purpose of loan, financial status, co-applicant, and why they're reliable. End with thanks and signature.

Need to make sure each letter is concise, specific, and covers all points from the profile. Avoid generic terms. Use exact numbers like 5 years, 4817 DM, etc. Also, mention the co-applicant, existing credit paid back, residence since 3 months, property type, etc.

Check for each letter that they don't repeat the same co-applicant relationships. Use different professions and reasons for negative checking account. Each should have unique personal circumstances but fit the profile parameters. Make sure the purpose ties into their job needs. Also, mention the installment rate and how they can manage it with their income.

Let me draft each letter step by step, ensuring all elements are covered without being too lengthy. Keep the language formal but straightforward, as motivation letters should be professional yet personal.

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4817 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my role as a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin. I have worked in this position for 5 years, earning a stable monthly income of 2800 DM. My current checking account balance is slightly negative due to recent expenses on laboratory equipment, but I have consistently maintained timely repayments on my existing bank credit for a smartphone, which I paid off over 18 months.  

As a single father with one dependent, I rely on a reliable vehicle to commute to work and transport my child to school. My co-applicant, my sister Anna Müller, is a nurse with a stable income and shares equal responsibility for the loan. I reside in my own apartment in Berlin since March 2022 and hold a building society savings agreement worth 2000 DM. My employer has confirmed my continued employment, and I have no other installment obligations.  

I trust my consistent repayment history and stable job as a research assistant demonstrate my reliability. I kindly request your approval and am happy to provide further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Becker

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a 4817 DM loan to purchase a car, which is necessary for my work as a municipal administrative officer in Hamburg. I have been employed by the city’s finance department for 6 years, earning 3100 DM monthly. My checking account is currently negative due to covering my mother’s medical expenses, but I have fully repaid my previous bank loan for home repairs.  

I live in my own apartment since January 2023 and have a life insurance policy valued at 1500 DM. My co-applicant, my sister Julia Hartmann, is a teacher and will share liability for the loan. The car will allow me to efficiently manage my job’s travel demands, including visiting local businesses for tax inspections.  

With my stable civil service job and punctual repayment history, I am confident in my ability to meet the 2 DM installment rate. I kindly ask for your support and offer to provide additional references.  

Respectfully,  
Markus Fischer
