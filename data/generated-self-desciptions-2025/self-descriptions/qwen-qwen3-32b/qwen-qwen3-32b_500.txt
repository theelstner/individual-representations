Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile mentions a foreign worker who is male, married or widowed, with one dependent. He has an unskilled job but is a resident. His existing checking account is between 0 and 200 DM with a duration of 18 months. He has a credit history of paying back previous credits. The purpose of the loan is for radio/television, and the amount is 1301 DM. Savings account is less than 100 DM. He's been employed for at least 7 years, has a guarantor, has lived in the current residence for 2 years, owns real estate, has a housing type of own, no other installment plans, one existing credit at the bank, and no telephone.

Wait, the job is listed as "unskilled - resident". So he's an unskilled worker but a resident. That might affect his income stability, but he's been in the job for over 7 years. Also, he's a foreign worker, so maybe he's in a different situation compared to locals.

Each letter needs to be from a different person. Let me think of five different scenarios where the person is applying for a loan for radio/television. The purpose is the same, but the reasons could vary. Maybe different reasons why they need the TV or radio, different aspects of their financial situation, etc.

Let me start with the first one. Maybe a foreign worker who's been in the country for a while, has a stable job, and wants to buy a TV for family reasons. He mentions his credit history, current employment, and the guarantor. Since he's married with one dependent, maybe he wants the TV for the family's entertainment or educational purposes.

Second person: Maybe he's a widower with a child, and the TV is for the child's education. He could mention that he has real estate, which shows he has some assets. Also, he's been in the current residence for 2 years.

Third person: Perhaps he's using the TV for a small business, like a kiosk where he streams news or something. Since his job is unskilled, maybe he's a vendor and needs the radio/TV for his business operations.

Fourth person: Maybe he's applying because he wants to stay connected with his home country through a radio or TV, and he emphasizes his savings account and existing credit paid back.

Fifth person: Maybe he's a community organizer who needs a TV for community events, using the guarantor's support and his real estate as collateral.

Wait, but the purpose is specifically radio/television. So each person's reason for needing the loan should be tied to purchasing these items. Let me make sure each letter has a unique angle but still fits the profile.

Also, each letter should mention the specific numbers: 1301 DM, 18 months checking account, 7+ years employment, 2 years residence, etc. Need to include those specifics.

I need to avoid generic terms. Instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant" as an example. Wait, but the profile says the job is "unskilled - resident." So maybe the job is something like a manual laborer, cleaner, etc. Let me adjust that. The example in the prompt showed replacing generic with specific, so for the job, instead of "unskilled," maybe "construction laborer" or "factory worker."

Also, the person is a foreign worker. Maybe mention that he's a resident but from another country.

Each letter should start with the applicant's name and address, then the bank's address, date, subject, and body. The body should explain the purpose, financial situation, and trustworthiness.

Let me outline each letter:

1. Construction Laborer: Applying for a TV for family. Mentions being a foreign worker, stable job for 8 years, guarantor is his brother.

2. Factory Worker: Widowed, wants TV for his child's education. Owns real estate, has a guarantor (friend).

3. Market Vendor: Needs TV for business (showing news to customers). Has been in residence for 2 years, stable employment.

4. Maintenance Worker: Wants to connect with home country via satellite TV. Has paid back previous credit, guarantor is a cousin.

5. Community Center Volunteer: Needs TV for community events. Uses his real estate as collateral, has a guarantor.

Each should have specific numbers: 1301 DM loan, 4 installment rate (maybe 4%?), but the installment rate might refer to the percentage of income. Wait, the profile says installment rate:4. Not sure what that means exactly, but maybe in the letter it's not necessary to explain unless it's part of the financial situation. Maybe just mention the monthly payment they can handle.

Also, savings account is less than 100 DM, so they don't have much saved. But they have real estate, which is an asset.

Make sure each letter is concise, not too long. Avoid formatting, just plain text with line breaks.

Let me start drafting the first letter.

First person: Let's say his name is Ahmed. He's a construction laborer from Morocco, working in Germany. Married with one child. Has a guarantor, maybe his brother. He wants a TV for the family. Mentions his 8 years of employment, existing credit paid back, and the guarantor.

Second person: Maybe a person named Raj, a factory worker in India, but resident in another country. Widowed, with a child. Uses TV for educational programs. Owns a small property.

Third person: Maria, a market vendor in Spain, needs a TV to show news to customers. She's a foreign worker from Mexico. Has a guarantor, her friend.

Fourth person: Carlos, a maintenance worker in Brazil, wants to install a satellite TV to connect with his home country. Guarantor is his cousin.

Fifth person: Hassan, a community volunteer in the UK, needs a TV for community center activities. Uses his real estate as collateral.

Each letter should have these elements. Now, write each letter with these specifics, making sure to include all required profile attributes with concrete numbers and roles.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, and I am a construction laborer residing in Munich, Germany. I have worked at a local construction site for the past 8 years, earning a stable monthly income. As a foreign worker from Morocco, I have maintained my checking account here for 18 months, with a balance of 150 DM. I am applying for a 1,301 DM loan to purchase a television for my family, as my wife and I rely on it for news and educational programming for our 6-year-old son.  

I currently own real estate in my hometown and have paid back all previous credits without delay. My brother, who lives nearby, has kindly agreed to act as my guarantor. Though my savings account holds only 80 DM, my steady employment and home ownership demonstrate my financial responsibility. I am committed to repaying this loan in full and have budgeted 4% of my monthly income toward installments. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Mohamed

Dear [Bank Name],  

I am Rajesh Kumar, a 32-year-old textile factory worker in Leicester, UK. I migrated from India 9 years ago and have resided at my current address for 2 years. My wife passed away 3 years ago, and I now raise my 10-year-old daughter alone. I seek a 1,301 DM loan to buy a television to support her education, as she benefits greatly from learning programs.  

I have a checking account with this bank for 18 months, though it holds little due to my recent focus on covering school expenses. My job at the factory has provided consistent income for 7 years, and my childhood friend, Arjun, has offered to guarantee this loan. I own a small property in Leicester and have no other debts. My savings account contains 50 DM, but I prioritize timely repayments. I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling this obligation.  

Respectfully,  
Rajesh Kumar

I am confident in my ability to manage this new payment.  

Gratefully,
