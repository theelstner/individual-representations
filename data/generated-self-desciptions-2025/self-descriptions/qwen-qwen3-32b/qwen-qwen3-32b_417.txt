Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the details.

First, the profile includes someone who is a skilled employee or official, has been in their current job for at least 7 years. They are 35 years old, male, single, with two dependents. They have a critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank, no checking account, savings under 100 DM, own their home, have a building society savings agreement or life insurance, and have a registered foreign worker. The loan purpose is for a used car, amount 5842 DM, installment rate 2. They've been in their current residence for 2 years, have two existing credits at this bank, and have a telephone.

Now, I need to create five different people with specific roles instead of generic terms. Let me think of different skilled jobs or official roles. Maybe a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a nurse, a teacher, and an IT technician. Each should have a unique reason for needing the loan. Let me assign each with different specifics.

For each letter, I need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They all have similar profiles but need distinct personal touches. Let me start with the first one: a scientific research assistant. He might need the car for commuting to a lab. He has two dependents, so maybe mention his family responsibilities. His critical credit history could be due to past medical bills, but he's repaying now. He has a building society savings and owns his home. He's been in his job for 8 years. That should work.

Second person: a mechanic. Maybe he needs a reliable car for work-related travel. His credit issues could stem from a previous motorcycle loan. He's been employed at the same garage for 7 years. Lives in his own house, has dependents, and a foreign worker registered. Emphasize steady income and timely repayments.

Third: a nurse. She might need a car for night shifts and transporting dependents. Her critical credit history could be from student loans. She's worked at the same hospital for 9 years. Owns her home, has savings in a building society. Highlight her stable job and responsibility towards family.

Fourth: a teacher. Needs a car for commuting and school activities. Credit issues from a past home renovation. Employed for 7 years, owns home, two kids. Emphasize dedication to job and community involvement.

Fifth: IT technician. Needs a car for client visits. Credit history affected by a previous laptop purchase. Works for a company for 8 years, owns home, dependents. Highlight technical skills and steady income.

Each letter should start with their name and address, then explain their situation. Make sure to mention the specific job, duration, savings, residence, dependents, and reasons for the loan. Also, address their credit history by showing they've managed past debts responsibly. Conclude by requesting the loan and expressing willingness to provide more info.

Let me check if all the profile attributes are covered in each letter. Checking account: none. Duration 36 months (3 years). Credit history critical but with existing credits elsewhere. Purpose: used car. Amount 5842 DM. Savings <100 DM. Employment >=7 years. Single male with 2 dependents. No other debtors. Residence 2 years. Property: building society or life insurance. Age 35. No other installment plans. Housing: own. 2 existing credits at the bank. Job specifics. Telephone: yes. Foreign worker registered.

Each letter needs to incorporate these points with specific examples. Avoid generic terms. Make sure the letters are concise but complete. End with a proper closing. No formatting, just plain text. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they're distinct and cover all necessary points.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Lars Müller, and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, where I have worked for the past 8 years. I am writing to request a loan of 5842 DM to purchase a used car to facilitate my daily commute to the lab, which is essential for supporting my two young children and managing my household.  

Currently, I do not have a checking account but maintain a building society savings agreement, which reflects my commitment to financial responsibility. While my credit history includes a critical period due to unforeseen medical expenses, I have consistently repaid other debts, including my existing credits with this bank, which I have managed for 2 years. My stable income, combined with my 8-year tenure in this role, allows me to afford an installment rate of 2 DM. I own my residence and have a registered foreign worker assisting with childcare, further demonstrating my structured approach to family and finances.  

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan promptly. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

With 7 years of uninterrupted work and a registered foreign worker assisting with household tasks, I am committed to fulfilling this loan’s terms.
