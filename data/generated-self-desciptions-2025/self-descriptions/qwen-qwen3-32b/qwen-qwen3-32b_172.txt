Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me list them out:

- Checking account: less than 0 DM
- Duration of checking account: 15 months
- Credit history: no credits taken or all paid back
- Purpose: new car
- Credit amount: 950 DM
- Savings account/bonds: less than 100 DM
- Employment since at least 7 years
- Installment rate: 4
- Male, single
- No other debtors/guarantors
- Residence since 3 years
- Property: car or other
- Age: 33
- No other installment plans
- Housing: rent
- 2 existing credits at this bank
- Job: skilled employee or official
- Dependents: 2
- No telephone
- Foreign worker: yes

Each letter needs to be from a different person, so I need to vary the specific details. Let me think of different job roles for the "skilled employee / official" part. Maybe a mechanic, electrician, teacher, IT technician, and a scientific research assistant. That gives me five different professions.

For each person, I need to explain why they're applying for the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. The letters should be short and concise. Let me make sure to include specific instances of the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "automotive mechanic" or something specific.

Also, the credit amount is 950 DM for a new car. Each person's purpose is a car, but maybe different types of cars? Or maybe the same, but different reasons for needing the car. Maybe for work, commuting, family needs, etc.

Financial situation: checking account is negative, savings less than 100 DM. They have been employed for over 7 years, so they have job stability. They are foreign workers, so maybe they have been working in the country for several years. They have two dependents, so maybe mention supporting their family. They are renting, have been living in the current residence for 3 years.

Trustworthy aspects: credit history is good, all credits paid back. They already have two credits at the bank, which shows they have a relationship with the bank. No other debts or installment plans. Maybe mention their steady job and long-term employment.

I need to make sure each letter is unique. Let me brainstorm for each profession:

1. Automotive Mechanic: Needs a reliable car to get to work and transport dependents. Works at a repair shop, has been employed for 8 years. Maybe mention that his car is old and broke down.

2. Electrician: Needs a van for work and family. Has been self-employed for 7 years. His current car is not suitable for work equipment.

3. Teacher: Needs a car for commuting and transporting children. Works at a school, employed for 9 years. Current car is too small for the family.

4. IT Technician: Needs a car for client visits and family. Works for a tech company, employed for 8 years. Current car is unreliable.

5. Scientific Research Assistant: Needs a car for commuting to a lab and for family. Works at a research institute, employed for 7 years. Current car is outdated.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then a salutation. Then explain the purpose of the loan, their financial situation (mention checking account is negative, but maybe they have a steady income), their employment history, dependents, and why they are trustworthy (credit history, existing credits paid on time, etc.). Conclude with gratitude and a request for approval.

I need to make sure that each letter doesn't use the same phrases. Vary the reasons for needing the car, the job specifics, and maybe the exact numbers where possible (like employment duration: 7, 8, 9 years, etc.)

Also, note that they have two existing credits at the bank. Maybe mention that they have managed those responsibly.

Let me start drafting each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered and specific details are included.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, and I am writing to request a loan of 950 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As an automotive mechanic with eight years of experience at City Auto Repairs, I rely on a reliable car to commute to work and transport my two children to school. Unfortunately, my current vehicle has broken down repeatedly, and I need a dependable replacement.  

I have been employed at my current job for eight years and earn a stable monthly income of 2,200 DM. Though my checking account is currently in deficit due to recent car repairs, I have a history of repaying debts responsibly—my two existing loans with your bank are paid punctually. I reside in my rented apartment with my family and have lived there for three years. As a foreign worker who has contributed to this community for over a decade, I prioritize financial responsibility. I kindly request your support to secure this loan, as it will significantly improve my work efficiency and family’s safety.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Mohamed

Dear [Bank Name],  

I am Elias Schneider, a self-employed electrician with seven years of experience, and I need 950 DM to purchase a new van essential for my work and family transportation. My current vehicle is too small to carry tools and equipment, leading to delays in client projects.  

I have maintained a steady income of 2,500 DM monthly for years, though my checking account occasionally dips due to upfront material costs. I have no prior credit history but have consistently repaid my two existing loans with your bank. My savings, though minimal at 80 DM, reflect my recent reinvestment in business tools. I have lived in my rented home for three years and support my two children as a single father.  

Your approval would enable me to serve clients more efficiently and ensure my family’s mobility. I assure you of timely repayments, given my stable income and commitment to financial responsibility.  

Thank you for your trust.  

Best regards,  
Elias Schneider

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Rajiv Patel, and I am a primary school teacher employed for nine years. I seek a 950 DM loan to replace my aging car, which is no longer safe for commuting 40 km daily or transporting my two children.  

With a monthly salary of 2,100 DM, I have diligently repaid my two existing credits and maintained a good credit history. My checking account’s temporary deficit stems from recent medical expenses for my mother, whom I care for alongside my children. I have resided in my rented apartment for three years and contribute to the community as a foreign worker since 2015.  

This loan will alleviate the stress of unreliable transportation and allow me to focus on my teaching duties. I am confident in my ability to meet repayment installments, given my stable employment and financial discipline.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Rajiv Patel

Dear [Bank Name],  

I am Lukas Müller, an IT technician at TechSolutions GmbH, where I have worked for 7.5 years. I am applying for a 950 DM loan to purchase a vehicle for client site visits and family use. My current car’s frequent breakdowns disrupt my work and create logistical challenges for my two sons and me.  

Despite my checking account’s temporary negative balance—due to unexpected computer repairs—I have a strong repayment track record. My monthly income of 2,400 DM covers my rented housing and dependents’ needs. I have no prior credits but have responsibly managed my two existing loans with your bank. As a foreign worker since 2018, I value reliability and financial integrity.  

A new car will enhance my professional performance and family’s quality of life. I assure you of timely repayments and appreciate your support.  

Thank you for your trust.  

Kind regards,  
Lukas Müller

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Yuki Tanaka, a scientific research assistant at the National Environmental Institute. I need 950 DM to replace my 12-year-old car, which is no longer suitable for my 30 km daily commute or transporting my children.  

Employed for eight years, I earn 2,300 DM monthly and have consistently repaid my two current loans. My checking account’s deficit results from recent lab supply purchases for my project. I have lived in my rented residence for three years and have no other debts.  

As a foreign worker since 2016, I take pride in my punctuality and responsibility. This loan will ensure my punctuality at work and my family’s safety. I am confident in my ability to meet repayment terms and request your approval.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Yuki Tanaka
