Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application. Each letter has to be from a different person with specific attributes based on the given profile. First, I need to make sure I understand the profile details.

The profile mentions a foreign worker who is a skilled employee, male, single, 50 years old, has been in a job for 1-4 years, has no checking account but has savings between 500-1000 DM. The purpose is a used car loan of 1236 DM. They have a good credit history, no other debts, live in rented housing, and have a building society savings agreement or life insurance. They've been in their residence for 4 years, have one existing credit at the bank, and no telephone.

I need to create five distinct individuals. Each should have unique specifics. Let me brainstorm different job roles under "skilled employee/official." Maybe a mechanic, electrician, IT technician, nurse, and a teacher? Each will have different reasons for needing a car. For example, a mechanic might need a reliable car to reach job sites, a nurse for shifts, etc.

Next, each person's financial situation must align with the profile. They all have similar savings, employment duration, and residence time. I should vary the specifics slightly. For example, one might have been working as a mechanic for 2 years, another as an electrician for 3 years. Their savings could be different amounts within the 500-1000 DM range.

Trustworthiness is key. Each letter should emphasize timely repayment of past credits, stable employment, and how the car will improve their financial situation. Maybe mention how having a car will allow them to take more jobs or commute better, increasing their income.

I need to ensure each letter is concise, starts with their name and address, then the bank's details. They should state their purpose clearly, their current financial standing, and why they're trustworthy. Avoid any formatting, just plain text. Also, make sure each ends properly with a sign-off.

Wait, the user mentioned "Do not cut off the letter - be sure to write a proper ending!" So each letter needs a full conclusion, maybe thanking the bank and expressing hope for approval. Also, no markdown, just plain text with line breaks.

Let me check the example they provided. The sample letters have specific job roles, exact numbers (like 8 years instead of >=7), and personal touches. Each has a unique angle. For instance, one might need the car for work-related travel, another for family reasons.

I need to vary the reasons: job requirements, dependents needing transport, starting a side business, etc. Also, different savings amounts, like 600 DM, 750 DM, etc. Each person's employment duration should be between 1-4 years, so maybe 2, 3, 1.5, etc.

Also, since they're foreign workers, maybe mention their legal status or how long they've been working in the country. But the profile says "foreign worker: yes," so perhaps just stating their employment without going into too much detail.

Make sure each letter is from a different perspective, with unique personal circumstances but all fitting the profile. Avoid repetition in the reasons and job roles. Check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter: checking account status, credit history, savings, employment duration, residence, etc.

Let me outline each of the five letters:

1. Automotive Electrician: Needs a van for work. Savings 700 DM, employed 3 years.
2. IT Technician: Needs a car for client visits. Savings 600 DM, employed 2 years.
3. Nurse: Needs reliable transport for night shifts. Savings 900 DM, employed 1.5 years.
4. Construction Site Manager: Needs a truck for job. Savings 550 DM, employed 4 years.
5. Language Teacher: Needs a car for tutoring jobs. Savings 800 DM, employed 2.5 years.

Each should mention their specific job, how the car aids their work, their savings, employment duration, and residence. Emphasize timely repayment and financial responsibility. Make sure they all have a dependent (1 child), rent housing, and have a building society savings agreement.

Now, draft each letter with these specifics, keeping them short and concise. Avoid generic terms, use exact numbers and roles. Ensure each ends properly with a thank you and hope for approval.
