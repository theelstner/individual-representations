Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific details. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required elements.

First, the profile says the person has no checking account but has been with their current job for 1 to 4 years. The credit history is critical with existing credits not at this bank. The loan purpose is a new car, amount 1224 DM. Savings are less than 100 DM. They've been employed for 9 months, are a male, single, foreign worker, own their home, have 1 dependent, no phone, and two existing credits at the bank. Their job is a skilled employee or official, like a scientific research assistant.

Wait, the duration in months is 9 for the checking account? Or is that the duration of employment? Let me check again. The profile says "Duration in month:9" under existing checking account, but since they have no checking account, maybe that's a data entry thing. Oh, the profile says "Status of existing checking account: no checking account". So maybe the "Duration in month:9" refers to something else? Maybe the duration at current residence? Wait, the profile also says "Present residence since:1" which is in years? Maybe the 9 months is for something else. Maybe the employment duration? The profile says "Present employment since:1 <= ... <4 years", so employment duration is between 1 and 4 years. So maybe each person has been employed for, say, 2 years, 3 years, etc. But the exact number isn't specified, so I can pick numbers within that range.

Also, the loan amount is 1224 DM for a new car. Each applicant needs to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They have critical credit history but existing credits not at this bank. They have two existing credits at this bank. They own real estate, have a dependent, are foreign workers, no phone, etc.

I need to invent specific instances. Let me think of different professions for each person. The job is skilled employee or official. Examples could be a scientific research assistant, electrician, IT technician, teacher, or maybe a nurse. Each person's letter should have unique details.

Let me outline each person:

1. Scientific Research Assistant: Maybe works at a university or lab, has been employed for 2 years, needs a car for commuting longer distances, has a dependent child, owns a small apartment, two existing credits (maybe a bike loan and a furniture loan), critical credit history due to past issues with another bank, but now stable. Emphasize steady income, ownership of property, commitment to repay.

2. Electrician: Self-employed or working for a company, 3 years at current job, needs a reliable car for client visits, has a dependent parent, owns a house, existing credits for tools and equipment. Highlight punctual payments on current loans, real estate as collateral, steady work.

3. IT Support Technician: Employed for 1.5 years, needs a car for daily commute and work-related travel, dependent is a spouse, owns property, existing credits for a laptop and mobile phone (but phone is listed as none? Wait, the profile says telephone: none. So maybe they don't have a phone. Hmm. So in the letters, they shouldn't mention having a phone. So maybe the IT technician uses a work phone, but personally doesn't own one. Need to be careful with that.)

Wait, the profile says "Telephone: none" for all. So each applicant doesn't have a telephone. So in their letters, maybe they mention that they don't have a phone but can be reached through their workplace or another method. Or maybe they don't mention it unless necessary.

Also, each has a foreign worker status. So maybe they came from another country, have been working there for some time.

Each letter should be concise. Let me start drafting each one.

First letter: Scientific Research Assistant. Let's say he's 30, works at a university, employed for 2 years, has a child, owns a small apartment. His existing credits are a bike loan and a furniture loan. He needs a car to commute because his lab is far. He's a foreign worker from, say, India, working in Germany. He's been living in his residence for 1 year. His savings are low because he's been saving for the car. He emphasizes his stable job, real estate ownership, and that he's managed his existing loans responsibly despite past credit issues.

Second letter: Electrician. Maybe from Spain, working in Germany. Employed for 3 years, has a dependent parent he supports. Needs a car for job-related travel. Owns a house. Existing credits at the bank are for tools and a van (but the loan amount is 1224 DM for a car, so maybe the van is paid off, and now needs a new car). He can mention that he's always paid his previous loans on time, which shows trustworthiness.

Third letter: IT Support Technician. From Poland, working in Germany. Employed for 18 months. Needs a car for commuting and work visits. Dependent is a young child. Owns property. Existing credits are for a laptop and a course (maybe?), but the profile says other installment plans: none. Wait, the profile says "Other installment plans:none". So he doesn't have other installment plans. So existing credits at the bank are two, which could be, for example, a laptop and a service contract. He can mention that he's been working steadily, has real estate, and the car will help him maintain his job by being punctual.

Fourth letter: Maybe a teacher's assistant. From Romania, employed for 3 years at a school. Needs a car to reach the school which is in a different city. Has a dependent sibling. Owns a condo. Existing credits are for home repairs and a bicycle. Emphasizes that the car will reduce transportation costs and that he has a stable income.

Fifth letter: Maybe a nurse. From Portugal, working in Germany for 2.5 years. Needs a car to commute between shifts and to transport the dependent child. Owns a house. Existing credits for medical equipment and a wardrobe. Highlights her dedication and the necessity of the car for her work and family.

Each letter needs to address the bank, state purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Since they have critical credit history, they should acknowledge past issues but show improvement. Also, they have existing credits at the bank, so mention managing those well.

Need to make sure each letter is unique in profession, specific details, and reasons for the loan. Also, check that all profile attributes are covered: age 30, single male, foreign worker, own home, 1 dependent, no phone, two existing credits, etc.

Now, writing each letter with these points. Keep them short, no formatting, proper ending.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
To Whom It May Concern,  

I am writing to request a loan of 1,224 DM to purchase a reliable vehicle that will support my daily work as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich. As a foreign worker from India, I have been employed in this role for 2.5 years and own a small apartment in Garching, which I purchased 18 months ago. While my credit history includes past challenges with a loan from a previous bank, I have since prioritized financial responsibility, maintaining two existing credits at your bank (a bicycle loan and a furniture loan) with consistent payments. My monthly income of 2,400 DM, combined with my ownership of real estate, demonstrates my stability. Though my savings are currently below 100 DM due to allocating funds toward this car, I am committed to repaying this loan in full. The vehicle will reduce my commuting costs and ensure punctuality for my research duties. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Lalit Kumar

I seek a 1,224 DM loan to purchase a car essential for my work as a certified electrician in Berlin. Having relocated from Spain three years ago, I have been employed with ElektroService GmbH for 32 months and own a house in Spandau. My current credits at your bank—a toolset loan and a van maintenance loan—are paid punctually, reflecting my dedication to financial obligations. My credit history has had setbacks, but I have learned from past missteps and now budget carefully. My monthly income is 2,600 DM, and I support my aging mother, who lives with me. The car will allow me to reach clients efficiently, increasing my business revenue to repay this loan. I ask for your trust in my reliability and growth.  

Respectfully,

To Whom It May Concern,  

As a IT support technician at TechNova GmbH for 18 months, I require a vehicle to commute and assist remote clients across Frankfurt. I am a 30-year-old foreign worker from Poland, residing in my owned apartment for one year. My two existing credits at your bank—a laptop loan and a professional certification fee—are managed without delay. While my savings are minimal (90 DM), my stable 2,200 DM monthly salary and property ownership underscore my capacity to repay. My dependent child relies on my income, motivating me to maintain punctual payments. This car will reduce public transport expenses and enhance my work efficiency. I assure you of my commitment to this loan’s terms.  

Gratefully,
