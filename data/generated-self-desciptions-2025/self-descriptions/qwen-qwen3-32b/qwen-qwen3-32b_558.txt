Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

First, the profile has a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM, duration of 18 months. Credit history is clean—no issues. Purpose is a new car, credit amount 2278 DM. Savings account between 100-500 DM. Employment duration less than a year. Installment rate 3. Female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors. Residence since 3 years. Property: car or other. Age 28. No other installment plans. Housing is own. Two existing credits at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. One dependent. No telephone. Foreign worker yes.

So each letter needs to reflect these specifics but with unique personal touches. Let me think of different scenarios. Let's vary the job roles, maybe different countries of origin, different reasons for the car purchase, and different personal circumstances. For example, one could be a nurse, another a teacher, maybe a technician, a clerk, and an office assistant. Each should explain why they need the car—maybe for commuting to work, for school runs, medical reasons, job requirements, etc. They should also mention their financial stability, existing savings, and trustworthiness based on their credit history and existing credits at the bank.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, not too long. Start with addressing the bank, state purpose, explain their situation, financial status, why they need the loan, and why they're trustworthy. Each should have unique details. Let me outline each person:

1. Maria, 28, foreign worker from Mexico, scientific research assistant in Germany. She needs a car to commute to her lab. She has savings, two existing credits paid on time, stable housing, one dependent child. Emphasize her job stability despite less than a year employed, maybe she moved recently.

2. Amina, 28, from Ethiopia, works as a teacher's assistant in Germany. Needs a car to transport students with disabilities. She has a residence of 3 years, owns a car already? Or property? Wait, the profile says property is car or other. Maybe she has other property. Maybe she has some savings, and her job is stable. She's married with one dependent.

3. Priya, 28, from India, works as a skilled employee in IT support. Needs a car for long commutes. She's separated, has a child. Lives in own housing. Has savings and a good credit history. Maybe she mentions her two existing credits at the bank.

4. Hana, 28, from South Korea, works as a hospital administrator. Needs a car for work-related travel. She's divorced, has a dependent parent. She has a savings account and has been paying her existing credits. Emphasize her job's stability even though she's been in the current role less than a year.

5. Leila, 28, from Syria, works as a social worker in Germany. Needs a car to visit clients. She has been in Germany for 3 years, owns a car, has savings. She's married with one child. She has two existing credits here, and a clean history.

Each letter should mention the exact credit amount (2278 DM), purpose (new car), savings between 100-500 DM, duration in current job under a year, residence since 3 years, etc. Also, no telephone, which might be a detail to mention? Maybe not necessary if it's not relevant. Focus on the key points: trustworthiness, ability to repay, specific needs for the car, existing financial standing.

Make sure each letter is distinct. Avoid repetition in reasons for the loan. Use different professions and personal circumstances. Also, check that each letter has the required attributes: foreign worker, age 28, female, etc. Each should start with their name, address, date, then the bank's address. But since the user didn't specify formatting, maybe just the body of the letter? Wait, the user says "do not use any formatting", so maybe just the text without headers. But the example letters in the answer include the salutation and closing. Let me check the user's instruction again.

The user says: "Do not use any formatting on the letter." So probably just the body text with proper structure. Each letter should have a greeting, explanation, closing. Let me start drafting each one with these elements.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Maria Gonzalez, and I am a 28-year-old scientific research assistant at the Institute of Environmental Studies in Berlin. I am writing to request a loan of 2278 DM to purchase a reliable vehicle for daily commuting. As a foreign worker from Mexico, I relocated to Germany two years ago and have since built a stable career in scientific research. Although I have been employed at my current position for 10 months, I have prior work experience in my field spanning 8 years.  

I currently maintain a checking account with your bank for 18 months and have consistently paid back two existing credits (a mobile phone purchase and a furniture loan). My savings account holds 350 DM, and I reside in my own apartment in Berlin, where I have lived for 3 years. I am divorced and care for one dependent child. While my employment duration at this job is under a year, my contract is secure, and I am committed to repaying this loan through my monthly installment of 3 DM.  

I kindly ask for your trust in my ability to manage this responsibility. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Gonzalez
