Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM, duration of 30 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is a new car, credit amount 2150 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Present employment since 1 to 4 years. Personal status: female, divorced/separated/married. Guarantor for other debtors. Residence since 2 years. No property. Age 24. Other installment plans with bank. Housing: own. One existing credit at the bank. Job: skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

I need to create five different people with specific roles, names, and scenarios. Let me brainstorm some professions that fit "skilled employee / official." Maybe a nurse, teacher, accountant, lab technician, and a social worker. Each should have unique details.

First person: Let's take a nurse. Name: Maria Schmidt. She's 24, works at a clinic, has been there for 3 years. Divorced with one child. Lives in her own apartment for 2 years. She needs a car for commuting. Has a guarantor, maybe her mother. She has a small savings account. Paid back previous loans. No telephone, but that's okay.

Second: Teacher? Maybe Anna Müller, a primary school teacher with 2 years of experience. Married, one dependent. Guarantor is her sister. She needs a car for school activities. Foreign worker from another EU country.

Third: Accountant. Let's say Lena Weber, works at a firm, 4 years employed. Separated, lives in own housing. Guarantor is a friend. Needs a car for client visits.

Fourth: Lab technician. Maybe Julia Becker, works at a research institute. 2 years at current job. Married, one child. Guarantor is her brother. Needs a car for work commutes.

Fifth: Social worker. Nicole Fischer, works for a non-profit, 3 years employed. Divorced, one dependent. Guarantor is a colleague. Needs a car for home visits.

Each letter should mention their job specifics, duration, guarantor, residence, previous credit history, purpose of loan, and why they're trustworthy. Make sure to use specific numbers: 3 years employment, 2 years residence, etc. Also mention the existing credit at the bank, installment rate 4, savings less than 100 DM.

Check that each letter is concise, ends properly, no formatting. Avoid generic terms. Use real examples. Make sure each has a unique profession and slight variations in their situation but all fit the profile. Also, ensure they mention the guarantor and their role, and how the car will help their work or personal situation.

Now, draft each letter with these details. Make sure to personalize each one with the person's name, job, and specific circumstances. Keep the tone formal but sincere. Highlight their stable employment, good credit history, and the necessity of the car for their work or dependents. Mention the guarantor as an additional assurance for the bank.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Maria Schmidt, and I am a 24-year-old nurse at the Dresden City Clinic, where I have worked for the past three years. I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,150 DM to purchase a reliable car to ensure timely commuting between my shifts and my residence. As a single mother to my 5-year-old daughter, Lena, having a vehicle is essential for balancing work and childcare. I currently hold a checking account with your bank for 30 months and have consistently repaid my existing credit for household appliances. My mother, Mrs. Schmidt, acts as a guarantor for this loan, and I reside in my own apartment in Dresden, where I have lived for two years. Despite my savings account holding less than 100 DM due to recent expenses for Lena’s school supplies, I am committed to repaying this loan through my stable income. I kindly ask for your trust in my responsibility and dedication.  

Sincerely  
Maria Schmidt

Dear Bank Manager  

I am Anna Müller, a 24-year-old primary school teacher at the Leipzig Public School, employed there for 2.5 years. I seek a 2,150 DM loan to purchase a car for transporting students on field trips and managing school-related errands. My current checking account has been active for 30 months, and I have no delinquencies on my existing credit for furniture. My sister, Julia, who is a bank clerk, guarantees this loan. I have resided in my own apartment in Leipzig for two years and, as a foreign worker from Poland, I value financial discipline to support my 3-year-old son, Tomasz. Though my savings are minimal due to recent educational materials for my students, I assure timely repayments from my monthly salary. Your support would greatly enhance my ability to serve my community.  

Sincerely  
Anna Müller

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Lena Weber, a 24-year-old tax accountant at the Munich Accounting Firm, where I have worked for three years. I request a 2,150 DM loan to buy a car for visiting clients across the city. My current checking account has been with your bank for 30 months, and I have fully repaid my prior credit for a laptop. My colleague, Mark Fischer, is a guarantor for this loan. I live in my own apartment in Munich, having moved there two years ago, and I have one dependent, my 7-year-old daughter, Sophie. While my savings account holds 80 DM, my steady income and existing installment plans with the bank demonstrate my reliability. This vehicle will improve my efficiency at work, and I pledge to honor all repayments.  

Sincerely  
Lena Weber
