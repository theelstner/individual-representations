Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the required elements.

First, the profile details are:
- No checking account
- Duration in months: 24 (so 2 years)
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly
- Purpose: business
- Credit amount: 1258
- Savings account/bonds: less than 100 DM
- Present employment since 4-7 years
- Installment rate: 4 (maybe 4%? Or 4 installments? Need to clarify, but since it's a loan application, probably the rate)
- Male, single
- No other debtors/guarantors
- Present residence since 1 year
- Property: real estate
- Age: 25
- No other installment plans
- Housing: own
- Number of existing credits at this bank: 1
- Job: skilled employee or official
- Dependents: 1
- Telephone: yes
- Foreign worker: registered under the customer's name

Each letter needs to be from a different person. Let me think of five different scenarios where someone fits this profile but has unique situations. For example, different job roles, business purposes, maybe different reasons for needing the loan.

First person: Maybe a scientific research assistant who wants to start a small business related to their field. They have a stable job, paid back previous loans, need funds for equipment.

Second: A teacher or official in education who wants to open a tutoring center. They have real estate, own a house, and need funds for materials.

Third: A skilled tradesperson, like an electrician, looking to expand their services. They need a loan for tools or a van.

Fourth: Maybe someone in IT, like a systems administrator, starting a tech support business. They need funds for software licenses or hardware.

Fifth: A healthcare worker, like a lab technician, starting a home health service. They need money for medical supplies.

Each letter should explain why they're applying, their financial situation (including the existing credit they paid back, residence for 1 year, savings under 100 DM), and why they're trustworthy (steady job, good credit history, own home, etc.).

Need to make sure each letter is concise, doesn't cut off, and has a proper ending. Also, avoid formatting. Let me start drafting each one with specific roles and details.

First letter: Scientific research assistant. Name could be Lars Müller. Applied for 1258 DM to buy lab equipment for his own research consultancy. He's been employed at a university for 6 years, has real estate, lives there for 1 year, no checking account but has savings under 100 DM. Paid back previous loan. Trustworthy because of steady income and good credit history.

Second: Teacher, maybe Anna Becker, but wait, the profile says male. So male names. Let's say Thomas Becker. He's a teacher with 5 years at a school, wants to start an after-school program. Owns a house, has dependents (1 child). Trustworthy because of steady job and previous credit repayment.

Third: Electrician, Stefan Hoffmann, 25, works as a skilled electrician for 6 years. Needs loan for a van. Lives in own home, 1 year residence, no checking account but real estate as collateral. Paid back previous loan.

Fourth: IT systems administrator, Marc Schmidt, 25, 5 years in job, starting a cybersecurity consultancy. Needs funds for software licenses. Owns property, has dependents, good credit history.

Fifth: Healthcare, maybe a lab technician, Dennis Fischer. Starting a mobile lab service. Needs equipment. Has stable job, own home, etc.

Each letter should mention the purpose, their employment duration (between 4-7 years), residence for 1 year, existing credit paid back, savings under 100 DM, no other debts, own housing, and why they are trustworthy. Also, include the foreign worker registered under their name. Maybe mention that they have a registered foreign worker in their case? Or perhaps that they are a registered foreign worker? The profile says "Foreign worker: registered under the customers name". So maybe the customer has a foreign worker registered under them? Or they are a foreign worker registered under their own name? Probably the latter. So each applicant is a registered foreign worker. Need to mention that in the letters.

Also, each letter should start with their personal details, then the purpose, financial situation, and trustworthiness. Make sure each is unique in their profession and business idea. Let me check the numbers again: age 25, 2 years at current job (since present employment since 4-7 years? Wait, the profile says "Present employment since:4 <= ... <7 years" so between 4 to 7 years. So each person has been in their job for 4-7 years. So in the letters, specify 5, 6, etc. years.

Also, the loan amount is 1258 DM. Each letter should state that amount. Installment rate 4, maybe they can mention that they can handle 4 installments or it's related to their repayment plan.

Need to make sure that each letter is different enough. Let me start drafting each one with these points in mind.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Lars Müller, 25 years old, employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin for the past 6 years. I am applying for a 1,258 DM loan to purchase specialized equipment for my freelance environmental research consultancy. I currently reside in my own apartment, having lived there for 1 year, and own real estate as collateral. Though I do not maintain a checking account, I have consistently repaid my existing 800 DM student loan through this bank without default. My monthly income of 2,200 DM allows me to allocate 4% toward installments, and I have a registered foreign worker status under my name. With a stable job, no additional debts, and a dependent child, I assure timely repayment.  

Sincerely, Lars Müller
