Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the details.

First, the checking account has a balance between 0 and 200 DM, and the account has been open for 15 months. The credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is repairs, and the amount is 1308 DM. Savings are less than 100 DM. The person has been employed for at least 7 years. Installment rate is 4. They are a single male, no other debtors or guarantors, lived in the current residence for 4 years, property is a car or other, age 38, no other installment plans, housing is own, 2 existing credits at the bank, job is unskilled-resident, 1 dependent, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

So, for each letter, I need to create a unique person with specific details. Let's think about different scenarios where someone might need a loan for repairs. Maybe a carpenter, a mechanic, a cleaner, a delivery driver, and a warehouse worker. Each should have a specific reason for repairs—maybe fixing a roof, repairing a garage door, kitchen repairs, heating system, and electrical issues.

Each person's financial situation should reflect the profile: stable job for over 7 years, existing credits paid on time, savings under 100 DM, foreign worker status. They need to explain their need for the loan, their ability to repay, and trustworthiness.

Let me start with the first person: a carpenter from Mexico. He needs to repair his workshop roof. He's been working at a furniture factory for 8 years. He has a dependent child. He's living in his own house, has a used car. He's paid his existing credits on time. He'll mention his steady income and ability to make installments.

Second, a mechanic from the Philippines. Needs to fix the garage door to keep his tools safe. Worked at a repair shop for 7 years. His sister is his dependent. Emphasize his punctual payments and stable job.

Third, a cleaner from Vietnam. Needs kitchen repairs due to a leak. Has been cleaning offices for 9 years. Lives with her son. No savings but steady income. Highlight her responsibility and timely payments.

Fourth, a delivery driver from Colombia. Needs heating repairs. Drives for a logistics company, 8 years. Lives with his brother. Has a motorcycle. Stress his reliable job and existing credits managed well.

Fifth, a warehouse worker from Egypt. Needs electrical work done. Worked at a warehouse for 7 years. Lives with his mother. Emphasize his stable employment and commitment to repay.

Each letter should start with their personal details, state the purpose, explain their financial situation, and assure the bank of their trustworthiness. Make sure each has specific numbers and reasons. Avoid generic terms, use specific job titles and durations. Check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter. Also, ensure that each letter is concise and properly ends with a thank you and signature.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
My name is Carlos Mendoza, a 38-year-old carpenter from Mexico residing in Germany for 4 years. I apply for a 1308 DM loan to repair the roof of my workshop, which has developed leaks during recent storms. I’ve worked as a furniture assembler at a local factory for 8 years, earning a stable monthly income. My savings account holds 80 DM, and I currently have two small credits with this bank for tool purchases, both repaid punctually. I live in my own apartment with my 5-year-old son and own a 2009 Volkswagen. Though my savings are limited, my consistent income allows me to manage the 4 DM installment rate. As a foreign worker committed to my responsibilities, I assure timely repayments. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendoza
