Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the requirements.

First, the profile has specific details like a checking account balance under 0 DM, a duration of 12 months, a credit history of paid-back credits, purpose for a new car, credit amount 1372, savings under 100 DM, employment duration between 4-7 years, divorced male, no other debtors, residence since 3 months, property as car or other, age 36, no other installment plans, own housing, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, one dependent, no telephone, and foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I need to vary the specifics. Let me think of different scenarios. For example, different job roles, reasons for the car purchase, maybe different countries of origin as foreign workers, different aspects of their financial situation.

First person: Let's make him a scientific research assistant. He needs a car for commuting to a lab. Maybe he's from a different country and has been working there for 5 years. He mentions his stable employment and existing credit history.

Second person: Maybe a teacher. He needs a car to transport students or for school activities. He's been teaching for 6 years. He has a dependent child, so emphasizes responsibility.

Third person: A nurse. The car is for shifts in different hospitals. She's been working 4 years. Maybe mentions her stable job in healthcare.

Fourth person: An IT technician. Needs a reliable car for client visits. Employed for 5 years. Highlights technical job stability.

Fifth person: A social worker. Car needed for visiting clients. Worked 6 years. Emphasizes community service and trustworthiness.

Each letter should start with his name and address, date, bank details. Then explain purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Make sure to mention existing credit paid back, current job duration, residence, etc. Also, mention being a foreign worker, maybe from different countries each time? Or keep it generic? Maybe vary the country.

Check that each letter is concise, no formatting, proper ending. Avoid generic terms. Use specific numbers: 5 years employment, 3 months residence, 1 dependent, etc. Also, mention the exact credit amount 1372 DM for the car.

Make sure each letter is distinct in the reason for the loan and personal circumstances. Avoid repetition in the reasons. Maybe include different aspects like job stability, existing credit repayment, responsibility towards dependents, need for the car in their specific job role.

Also, since they have a negative checking account, they might mention a temporary financial dip but assure that their income is stable. Maybe explain that their savings are low but they have a steady job.

Need to ensure that each letter is from a different perspective but fits the profile. Let me outline each one:

1. Research Assistant: Lab work requiring reliable transport. Stable job, paid previous credit, need for new car to continue work.

2. Teacher: Transporting students, job as a teacher, need reliable vehicle for school duties.

3. Nurse: Multiple shifts, visiting different hospitals, car necessary for job.

4. IT Technician: Client site visits, need reliable transport to provide services.

5. Social Worker: Client visits, own housing, responsible for dependent, shows reliability.

Now, write each letter with these specifics, ensuring all profile attributes are addressed with concrete examples. Make sure to mention the exact numbers: 5 years employed, 3 months at residence, etc. Also, note that they are foreign workers, so maybe mention their commitment to the country, maybe their home country, but not necessary unless it adds to trustworthiness.

Check for each letter: purpose, financial situation (current account negative, savings low, but stable job), trustworthiness (credit history, employment, responsibility).

Avoid using formatting, keep paragraphs short. End with a polite closing.

Let me start drafting each letter now.
