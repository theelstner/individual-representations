Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required elements.

First, the profile details: The person has a checking account with less than 200 DM, has had it for 12 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is a new car, credit amount 1223 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Employed for at least 7 years. Divorced male with one dependent. No other debtors or guarantors. Lives in current residence for 1 month. Owns real estate. Age 46. No other installment plans. Rents housing. Two existing credits at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. No telephone. Foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique but fit these parameters. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe vary the job roles, reasons for the car purchase, and specific details about their situation.

First person: Let's make him a scientific research assistant. He needs a car for commuting to work. He has been in his job for 8 years. He owns real estate but rents a place now. Maybe he moved for a job. Divorced with one child. He has two existing credits (maybe a mortgage and a previous car loan). He's a foreign worker, so maybe he mentions his legal status or contributions.

Second person: Maybe a public official, like a municipal planner. He needs a reliable car for work-related travel. He's been employed for 7 years. His real estate is a property he owns but lives in a rental. Divorced, supports his child. Emphasizes timely payments on existing credits.

Third person: A skilled employee in a technical field, like an electrician. Needs a car for client visits. Has been working for 9 years. Maybe he's a foreign worker who has settled in the country. Explains his savings are low but he's consistent with payments.

Fourth person: An administrative official in a government office. Needs a car for job requirements. He's been in his job for exactly 7 years. Maybe he's moving to a new city for work, hence 1 month in current residence. Stresses his responsibility with existing credits.

Fifth person: A foreign worker in a skilled trade, like a mechanic. Needs a car to commute and take his child to school. Has been employed for 10 years. Owns real estate but rents out, living in a different area. Highlights his stable income and repayment history.

I need to make sure each letter includes the loan purpose, financial situation (checking account, savings, employment duration, existing credits), trustworthiness (credit history, job stability), and personal circumstances (divorced, dependent, housing). Also, each should have specific numbers and roles instead of generic terms. Avoid repetition in the examples. Check that each letter is concise, ends properly, and doesn't use any formatting. Let me draft each one now.

Dear Bank Loan Committee  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, a 46-year-old scientific research assistant at the Institute of Environmental Sciences. I am applying for a 1,223 DM loan to purchase a reliable car for daily commuting. I have held my current position for 8 years and earn a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. Though my checking account balance is 180 DM and my savings amount to 90 DM, I have consistently repaid two existing credits with your bank—a prior car loan and a furniture loan—without delay. I own a real estate property in my hometown but currently rent housing due to a recent job relocation. As a divorced father of one, I prioritize financial responsibility to support my 12-year-old daughter. My employment history and credit record reflect this commitment. I kindly request your approval to secure this loan, which will improve my mobility for work and family needs.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Mohamed
