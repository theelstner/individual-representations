Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile mentions a foreign worker who is a skilled employee or official. The person is male, single, 34 years old, with a checking account under 200 DM for 18 months. They have a good credit history, one existing credit paid back, a savings account between 100-500 DM, employed for 1-4 years, installment rate 4, owns a car or other property, lives in their own housing, has one existing credit at the bank, no other installment plans, no debtors/guarantors, 4 years at residence, and one dependent.

I need to create five different individuals. Let me think of different job roles for the "skilled employee / official" category. Maybe a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a teacher, a software developer, and a nurse. Each should have a unique business purpose for the loan. Let me check the credit amount is 2622 DM, so the purpose should be something that fits that amount. Maybe starting a small business, purchasing equipment, expanding a current venture, etc.

For each person, I need to explain their financial situation, why they need the loan, and why they're trustworthy. They all have a car or other property, so maybe mention owning a vehicle or tools. Also, since they have a savings account, mention the amount. Each should have a different angle but stick to the profile.

Let me start with the first one. The first person could be a scientific research assistant. He needs funds to start a small lab equipment business. He has been working at a university for 3 years, has a savings of 300 DM, owns a car, lives in his own housing. His credit history is good. He's been in Germany for 4 years, has a dependent, no phone. He'll use the loan to buy initial stock and set up a workshop.

Second, a mechanic. He wants to expand his auto repair shop. He's been employed at a garage for 2.5 years, has 400 DM in savings. Owns a van for his business. Lives in his own apartment. Has a good credit history. The loan will help him hire an assistant and buy tools.

Third, a teacher. Maybe he's starting an after-school tutoring center. He's been teaching at a local school for 3 years, has 200 DM savings, owns a car. The loan will cover renting a small space and materials. He's reliable with his job and has a dependent.

Fourth, a software developer. Starting a freelance IT consulting business. Employed as a developer for 1.5 years, savings of 150 DM, owns a laptop and car. Needs funds for software licenses and marketing. Trustworthy with timely repayments.

Fifth, a nurse. Opening a home healthcare service. Worked at a clinic for 2 years, savings of 250 DM, owns a car. Loan for medical supplies and insurance. Stable job and residence.

I need to make sure each letter includes specific numbers and roles, mentions the savings amount, employment duration, existing credit, and why they're trustworthy. Also, the purpose must be a business-related expense. Each letter should be concise, not too long, and end properly with a sign-off.

Let me check the profile again to ensure all attributes are covered. Each person has a checking account under 200 DM for 18 months, which is 1.5 years. They have been in their current job between 1-4 years. They own a car or other property. Age 34, single, one dependent. No telephone. Foreign worker. Existing credit at the bank. All these points should be reflected in the letters.

Now, drafting each letter with these details. Make sure each has a unique business purpose and specific numbers. Avoid generic terms, use exact figures like 3 years, 2.5 years, etc. Also, mention the savings amount within 100-500 DM. Each letter should start with the applicant's name, address, date, bank address, then the body explaining their situation, purpose, financial status, and trustworthiness. Conclude with a polite request and signature.

I need to ensure that each letter is distinct. Let me assign different business purposes and jobs. Also, check that the employment duration varies within the given range (1-4 years), and savings between 100-500. Also, mention the existing credit paid back, which shows reliability. Each person has a dependent, so maybe a child or relative. No telephone, so perhaps they don't have a landline, but that's okay.

Let me start writing the first letter for the scientific research assistant. Make sure to mention his exact job title, years employed, savings, purpose, and trustworthiness. Then proceed similarly for the others, changing the roles and specifics each time. Avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan. Each business should be different: lab equipment, auto shop expansion, tutoring center, IT consulting, home healthcare.

Check for conciseness. Each letter should be about 100-150 words. No markdown, just plain text with proper structure. Ensure that the closing is complete, not cut off. Also, use formal language but keep it short. Make sure the credit amount is 2622 DM, so the loan is for that exact amount. Each person needs to state the amount they're applying for. Also, mention the installment rate of 4, but maybe not necessary unless it's part of the repayment plan. The key points are the purpose, financial situation (checking account, savings, employment, property), credit history, and trustworthiness.

Once all five are drafted, review to ensure all profile attributes are represented in each letter with specific instances. No two letters should have the same job or business purpose. Also, check that each has a unique name and possibly different aspects of their financial situation within the given ranges. For example, one has 300 DM savings, another 400, etc. Employment duration: 3 years, 2.5, 3, 1.5, 2 years. Checking account duration is 18 months for all. Existing credit at the bank, paid back duly. Own residence, car, etc.

Alright, time to draft each letter step by step, making sure all these points are covered.
