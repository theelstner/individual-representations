Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says the person is a foreign worker, male, single, 34 years old, has been in their current job for at least 7 years, and has been residing in their current home for 4 years. They have no checking account, but have a savings account with less than 100 DM. They have no credit history or all credits paid back, and they have two existing credits at the bank. The purpose of the loan is furniture/equipment, amount 2759 DM, installment rate 2. They don't have a telephone.

I need to create five different individuals with specific instances. Let me brainstorm different job roles under "skilled employee / official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, teacher, IT technician, and a carpenter. Each should have a unique reason for needing furniture. Let me check the example given in the query: "scientific research assistant" instead of generic "skilled employee". So each person's job should be specific.

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Since they have no checking account, maybe they use cash or another method. They have savings under 100 DM, so they might need the loan for a specific purchase like furniture for a new apartment or replacing old items. Since they are foreign workers, maybe they have been working there for a while, have stable employment, and plan to stay.

Let me outline each person:

1. Scientific Research Assistant: Maybe needs furniture for a new apartment after moving. Has been working at a university for 8 years. Trustworthy because of stable job and paid back previous credits.

2. Electrician: Needs to buy equipment for his workshop. Has been self-employed for 7 years. Trustworthy due to consistent income and existing credits at the bank.

Wait, but the job is "skilled employee / official". Electrician is a skilled worker. But the profile says "skilled employee / official" – maybe "skilled employee" refers to a specific role. Let me check the original profile again. The job is listed as "skilled employee / official". So perhaps official is like a government job. Let me adjust. Maybe a teacher (public sector), IT technician in a company, etc.

Let me adjust the examples:

1. Scientific Research Assistant (as in example)
2. Public Sector IT Technician
3. Municipal Building Inspector
4. Hospital Laboratory Technician
5. Government Administrative Officer

Each has different reasons for the loan. Let me think of their purposes. For furniture, maybe moving into a new home, renovating, starting a home office, etc.

Each letter should mention their duration in job (specific, e.g., 8 years), residence (4 years as per profile), savings less than 100 DM, no checking account but maybe use direct deposits elsewhere. Also, mention their existing two credits at the bank, showing they have a relationship.

Need to make sure each letter is concise, not too long, and ends properly. Avoid formatting, just plain text. Also, each person is a foreign worker, so maybe mention their legal status or integration.

Let me start drafting each letter with these points in mind.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich specializing in renewable energy. I have worked in this position for 8 years and currently earn a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. I am applying for a 2,759 DM loan to purchase a new desk and ergonomic chair for my home office which I use exclusively for my research work. Though I do not currently have a checking account I have maintained a savings account with 85 DM at the Deutsche Sparkasse for the past 12 months. As a foreign worker from Egypt I have lived in my current apartment for 4 years and paid all previous housing expenses and utility bills on time. I already hold two small loans with your bank for laboratory equipment which I have consistently repaid without issue. With my secure employment and disciplined financial habits I am confident I can manage the 2 DM monthly installment. This loan will improve my productivity and comfort during long research hours. I respectfully request your approval and am prepared to provide any additional documentation needed.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Mohamed

Dear Sir or Madam  

I am writing to request a 2,759 DM loan to furnish my newly renovated kitchen. My name is Luis Fernandez and I work as a public sector IT technician for the city of Hamburg. In this role for 7 years I maintain computer systems across municipal departments and earn 3,100 DM monthly. Though I do not have a checking account I deposit my salary weekly at a savings institution where I keep 70 DM in a fixed-term account. I have no prior credit history but have always paid rent and bills promptly during my 4-year residency in my current apartment. As a Spanish citizen legally employed here since 2015 I value financial responsibility which is why I already hold two small loans with your bank for home maintenance which I repay on schedule. The loan would cover a modern kitchen set from IKEA including a table chairs and storage units. With my steady income and existing relationship with your institution I am certain I can manage the 2 DM installment. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this further.  

Best regards  
Luis Fernandez

Dear Bank Committee  

My name is Rajesh Patel and I am a municipal building inspector in Berlin. With 9 years of experience in this role I earn 2,950 DM monthly ensuring construction projects meet safety standards. I have no checking account but maintain a savings book with 40 DM at the bank. I am requesting 2,759 DM to replace my aging dining set which has developed structural issues. I have resided in my current home for 4 years and have never missed a payment on my two existing loans for professional tools.

My stable employment and history of timely repayments make me a reliable candidate. Thank you for considering my application.
