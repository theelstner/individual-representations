Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 200 DM, duration of 48 months. Credit history is no credits or all paid back. Purpose is business, credit amount 14421 DM. Savings account under 100 DM. Employment since 1-4 years. Installment rate 2. Male, single, no other debtors. Residence since 2 years. Property: car or other. Age 25. No other installment plans. Own housing. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered.

Each letter needs to be unique, with specific roles and scenarios. Let me brainstorm different roles that fit the profile. Maybe a scientific research assistant, a teacher, a mechanic, a nurse, and an IT technician. Each should have a business purpose for the loan. I need to make sure each letter includes their specific job, duration, savings, employment, residence, and other details from the profile.

For example, the first person could be a scientific research assistant at a university. He's been employed for 3 years, has a dependent, lives in his own housing. The loan is to start a lab supply business. He mentions his stable job, timely payments, and existing credit with the bank.

Second, a teacher at a private school. She's been teaching for 2.5 years, wants to open a tutoring center. She has a car as collateral. She's single with a dependent, has a savings account under 100 DM.

Third, an auto mechanic. He's been working at a garage for 3 years, wants to buy equipment for his own shop. Lives in his own home, has a car. No other debts, good credit history.

Fourth, a nurse working at a clinic. She's been employed for 2 years, wants to start a home healthcare service. Uses her car as collateral. Has a dependent, stable job.

Fifth, an IT technician. Worked at a company for 1.5 years, wants to start a tech support business. Owns a car, stable residence, no other debts.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then explain their purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Mention existing credit, stable job, residence, no other debts, and why they need the loan. End with gratitude and contact info.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, uses specific numbers (like 8 years instead of >=7), and includes all required elements. Avoid generic terms, use specific job titles and durations. Also, check that each letter is distinct in the business purpose and personal details.
