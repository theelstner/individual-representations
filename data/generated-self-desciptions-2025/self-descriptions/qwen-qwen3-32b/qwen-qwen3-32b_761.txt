Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

First, the profile has several attributes: the person has a checking account with less than 0 DM, has had it for 12 months, a critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank. The loan purpose is a new car, amount 691 DM. Savings account under 100 DM. Employed for at least 7 years, single male, no other debtors, residence for 3 years, property is building society savings or life insurance, age 35, no other installment plans, owns housing, two existing credits at the bank, job is skilled employee or official, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe vary the job roles, reasons for the loan, and specific details about their situation.

First person: Let's make him a scientific research assistant. He needs a car for commuting to a lab. He's been working there for 8 years. He has a building society savings. Maybe he mentions that his current car is broken and he needs a reliable one for work. He has dependents, so reliability is important.

Second person: Maybe a teacher. He's been teaching for 7 years. Needs a car to reach remote schools. He could mention that his current vehicle is outdated and unsafe. His savings are low, but he has life insurance. He emphasizes his stable job and existing credits at the bank as proof of responsibility.

Third person: Perhaps a nurse. Working in a hospital, needs a car for shifts and family. He's been employed for 9 years. His residence is in a different city, so the car helps with commute. He could mention that his existing credits are managed well, showing trustworthiness.

Fourth person: Let's go with an IT technician. He needs a car for client visits. His job requires mobility. Maybe he's been in the same residence for 3 years, has a life insurance policy. He could highlight his steady income and that the car will improve his work efficiency, benefiting the bank's investment.

Fifth person: A social worker. He needs a car to visit clients. His job is crucial for community service, and reliable transport is necessary. He's been working for 7 years, has a building society agreement. He might mention that his current car is too old and that this loan will help him maintain his job performance.

Each letter should start with addressing the bank, state the purpose, explain financial situation, why they're trustworthy. Need to make sure each has specific numbers and roles, not generic. Also, check that each has unique details. Avoid repetition in reasons for the loan. Make sure the letters are concise, not too long, and end properly. Also, ensure that they mention the existing credits at the bank as a positive point. Also, note the foreign worker aspect, maybe mention origin country briefly. And no telephone, so maybe they use another contact method? Or just omit it since it's not required. Also, dependents: maybe mention the child or family responsibility as a motivator to repay. Each letter should have a different angle but stick to the profile constraints. Let me draft each one step by step.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
To Whom It May Concern,  

I am writing to request a loan of 691 DM to purchase a reliable vehicle that will support my daily work as a scientific research assistant at the Berlin Institute for Environmental Science. I have worked there for 8 years, earning a stable monthly income of 2,400 DM. My current car, a 1995 model, recently broke down, and I urgently need transportation to reach my lab and field sites. While my savings account holds only 80 DM, I have a building society savings agreement and have consistently managed my two existing credits at this bank (a bicycle loan and a computer purchase) without issue. As a foreign worker from Poland, I have lived in my current residence for 3 years and am committed to repaying this loan to support my 6-year-old daughter and me. I kindly ask for your trust in my financial responsibility.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Bank Manager,  

I seek a 691 DM loan to replace my aging 1998 Volkswagen, which is no longer safe for my commute as a secondary school teacher in Dresden. With 7 years of employment at the school, I earn 2,100 DM monthly, yet my checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to recent home repairs. I hold a life insurance policy and have maintained two small credits here (a textbook loan and a laptop repayment plan) for 18 months without delay. My residence in Leipzig (3 years) and stable income ensure I can meet the 4 DM installment rate. As a single father to my 9-year-old son, I prioritize reliability—this car will allow me to reach remote schools for substitute teaching. I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan.  

Respectfully,  
Tobias Fischer

**Motivation Letter 3**  
To Whom It May Concern,  

As a nurse at the Munich University Hospital, I require a new vehicle to manage my rotating shifts and care for my 4-year-old daughter. My current car’s transmission failed, and I cannot afford repairs. I have worked in healthcare for 9 years, earning 2,300 DM monthly, and though my savings are minimal (90 DM), I have a building society savings agreement and no other debts. My two existing credits at this bank—a medical certification course loan and a refrigerator purchase—are fully repaid on time. I have lived in my apartment for 3 years and, as a foreign worker from Romania, value financial discipline. This loan will ensure my punctuality at work and my family’s safety. I am confident in my ability to meet payments.  

Sincerely,  
Andrei Ionescu

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for 691 DM to purchase a used car that will enable me to service clients as an IT technician in Frankfurt. My current vehicle, which I’ve owned since 2010, is too unreliable to visit clients across the city. I have worked at TechSolutions GmbH for 7 years, earning 2,500 DM monthly, and though my checking account is currently negative due to a laptop replacement, I have a life insurance policy and no outstanding debts beyond my two existing bank credits (a tool kit loan and a smartphone payment plan). I relocated to Germany from Spain 5 years ago and have resided at my current address for 3 years. This loan is essential for maintaining my job—my employer has emphasized the need for mobility. I guarantee timely repayments.  

Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendez

**Motivation Letter 5**  
To Whom It May Concern,  

As a social worker in Hamburg, I need a dependable car to visit clients in underserved areas. My 1997 car has exceeded 300,000 kilometers and is unsafe for winter travel. I have worked at the Social Care Agency for 7 years, earning 2,200 DM monthly, and though my savings are low (50 DM), I have a building society savings agreement and manage two small credits here (a course fee loan and a printer purchase) responsibly. I have lived in my apartment for 3 years and am a single parent to my 7-year-old son. My job requires flexibility, and this loan will ensure I fulfill my duties without disruption. As a foreign worker from Portugal, I take pride in my punctuality and financial integrity. I am confident in repaying this loan.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Costa
