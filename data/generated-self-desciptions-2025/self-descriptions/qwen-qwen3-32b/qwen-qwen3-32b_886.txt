Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile includes someone with a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM, has had it for 24 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 4057 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Employment duration 4-7 years. Installment rate 3. Male, divorced/separated. No other debtors/guarantors. Residence since 3 months. Property: car or other. Age 43. No other installment plans. Own housing. One existing credit at the bank. Job: skilled employee/official. One dependent. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

So each letter needs to be from a different person with these specifics. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different job roles, reasons for furniture, different car types, etc. Let me come up with five different people.

First person: Scientific research assistant, 6 years in job. Needs furniture for a new home office. Has a car. Divorced with one child. Let me check the numbers: age 43, 6 years employed, 3 years at residence. Savings under 100 DM. Existing credit paid back.

Second person: Maybe a teacher? 5 years as a teacher. Needs to buy new furniture for their child's room. They have a motorcycle as property. Divorced, living in own housing. Installment rate 3.

Third: Perhaps a technical officer? 5 years in job. Needs equipment for home gym. Car is an older model. One dependent, existing credit.

Fourth: Maybe a public administration official, 4 years employed. Needs furniture for a new apartment. Recently moved, residence since 3 months. Has a savings bond under 100 DM.

Fifth: Maybe a mechanic or skilled worker. 7 years at job. Needs to replace old furniture after a flood. Has a van as property. Divorced, own housing.

I need to make sure each letter includes all the profile points but with specific details. Each should explain the purpose, financial situation, and trustworthiness. They should be concise, not too long, and properly ended.

Let me start drafting the first one. Name: Thomas Müller, scientific research assistant. Checking account 150 DM for 24 months. Paid back previous credit. Applying for 4057 DM for home office furniture. Savings 80 DM. Employed 6 years at the research institute. Divorced, one child. Lives in own home, has a car. No other debts. Trustworthy because of timely payments and stable job.

Second letter: Anna Weber, 43, primary school teacher, 5 years at school. Needs furniture for child's room. Savings 50 DM. Car is a motorcycle. Residence since 3 years. Paid back previous loan. Installment rate 3. Stable income.

Third: Michael Becker, technical officer at a manufacturing plant, 5 years. Wants to buy exercise equipment for health. Car is a 2005 model. Divorced, one dependent. On-time payments, reliable job.

Fourth: Klaus Fischer, public official in local government, 4 years. Moving into new apartment, needs furniture. Residence since March. Savings 90 DM. Has a savings bond. No other debts. Trustworthy with credit history.

Fifth: Petra Schmidt, automotive mechanic, 7 years at garage. Flood damaged furniture, needs replacement. Property is a delivery van. Divorced, own housing. Timely payments on existing credit.

Each letter should start with sender's info, date, bank address, subject, then body. Make sure to mention all required points without being too verbose. End with a polite closing.

Need to check for each letter that they don't have other debtors, have telephone, foreign worker registered. Maybe mention the telephone in one or two, but since it's a yes, maybe just assume it's part of their situation without explicitly stating unless needed.

Also, the credit amount is 4057 DM, so each letter should mention that exact amount. The purpose is furniture or equipment, so maybe vary between furniture and equipment where possible, but the profile says furniture/equipment as a category. Maybe some have furniture, others equipment.

Let me make sure each letter has unique job titles and specific instances. Avoid repetition. Also, check that the duration in months is 24 (2 years), present employment since 4-7 years (so 4,5,6,7), but the profile says 4 <= ... <7, so up to 7 not included. So 4,5,6 years. Let me assign accordingly.

First person: 6 years employment. Second: 5. Third: 5. Fourth: 4. Fifth: 7? Wait profile says 4 <= ... <7, so less than 7, so up to 6. So fifth can be 6.

Also, residence since 3 months. So each person has been living there 3 months. Maybe mention moving into a new place, recent move for some purposes.

Okay, I think I have a structure. Now write each letter with these details, making sure they are concise and cover all required attributes with specific examples.
