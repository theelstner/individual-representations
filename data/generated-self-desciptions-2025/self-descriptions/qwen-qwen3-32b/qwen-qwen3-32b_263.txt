Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the requirements.

First, the profile includes details like existing checking account status (less than 0 DM), duration of 24 months, credit history of existing credits paid back duly, purpose for radio/television, credit amount 1603 DM, savings account less than 100 DM, employment since at least 7 years, female, divorced/separated/married, no other debtors, residence since 4 years, property like a car, age 55, no other installment plans, own housing, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

Each letter needs to be from a different person. I need to invent specific instances for generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe a scientific research assistant, teacher, nurse, etc. Also, durations should be specific: "8 years" instead of ">=7 years." The purpose is radio/television, so maybe each person has a different reason related to that—like a radio for a small business, TV for educational purposes, etc.

Each letter should explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They need to be concise and not cut off. Also, no formatting, just plain text. Let me start brainstorming five different scenarios.

First person: Maybe a teacher who needs a TV for her child's education. She's been teaching for 8 years, has a car, lives in her own home, has a savings account with 80 DM. She's divorced, has one dependent, works as a primary school teacher. She has a good credit history, and wants the TV to help her child with homework.

Second person: A nurse who needs a radio for her small business. She's been working as a nurse for 7 years, has a car, lives in her own home. Maybe she runs a home healthcare service and needs a radio for communication. She's married, has one dependent, has an existing credit, and is a foreign worker.

Third person: A scientific research assistant who wants to buy a TV for language learning. She's been in her job for 10 years, has a savings account of 50 DM. She's separated, lives in her own home, has a car. She's a foreign worker, needs the TV to improve her German for better job opportunities.

Fourth person: An office administrator who needs a radio for her elderly mother. She's been working for 9 years, has a car, lives in her own home. She's divorced, has one dependent (her mother). She's a foreign worker, has a good credit history, and needs the radio to keep her mother entertained.

Fifth person: A public official who wants to purchase a TV for educational programming. He's been working for 7 years, has a car, lives in his own home. He's married, has one child. He's a foreign worker, has an existing credit, and needs the TV to provide educational content for his child.

Wait, the profile specifies "Personal status and sex: female : divorced/separated/married". So all five applicants should be female. Also, the job is skilled employee or official. So maybe adjust the fifth person to be female. Let me correct that.

Also, each letter should mention the specific numbers: 24 months checking account, 8 years (or more) employment, 4 years residence, 1 existing credit, etc. Each should have these elements tailored.

Let me outline each letter with these specifics.

First letter: Female teacher, 55 years old, divorced, one child. Checking account negative for 24 months? Wait, the profile says existing checking account status <0 DM. So maybe she has a negative balance? Or maybe it's a typo and refers to the duration. Wait, the original German might have been that the checking account has been open for 24 months. Wait, the profile says "Duration in month:24" for the existing checking account. So each person has a checking account that's been open for 24 months. So I should mention that in each letter. Also, savings account <100 DM, so maybe 80 DM, 50 DM, etc.

Each letter needs to include:

- Purpose: radio/television (specific reason)
- Credit amount: 1603 DM
- Existing checking account duration: 24 months
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly
- Employment duration: >=7 years (specific, like 8, 7, 10)
- Residence since 4 years
- Property: car or other
- Age 55
- Dependents: 1
- Foreign worker: yes
- No telephone

Each letter should be from a different profession: teacher, nurse, research assistant, office administrator, public official.

Now, write each letter with these elements. Make sure to explain why they need the loan, their financial stability (steady job, paid back previous credits), and why they're trustworthy (stable income, residence, etc.)

Check for conciseness, proper ending, no formatting. Let me start drafting each one.

Dear Bank Manager

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1603 DM to purchase a television for my household. As a primary school teacher at St. Agnes School in Munich, I have been employed for 8 years and earn a stable monthly income of 2200 DM. My current checking account has been active for 24 months, and I have consistently repaid my previous car loan of 8000 DM over 4 years. Though my savings account holds only 80 DM, I reside in my own apartment in Garching and own a 2009 Volkswagen Golf. At 55 years old, I care for my 16-year-old daughter alone since our divorce 3 years ago. As a foreign worker from Poland, I have built a reliable financial history and believe this television will support her homework and my professional development through educational programs. I am confident in my ability to manage the 4 DM installment rate monthly.

Sincerely  
Maria Kowalska

My stable income and 4-year residence here confirm my trustworthiness.

This television will provide essential practice through cultural programming.
