Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

First, the profile has several key points: the applicant has a checking account with less than 200 DM, has had it for 48 months (which is 4 years), a good credit history with existing credits paid back. The purpose is for radio/television, credit amount 3979 DM. Savings account is unknown or none. Employment since 4-7 years. Single male, no other debtors, residence since 1 month (so just moved?), property is car/other, age 41, no other installment plans, owns housing, two existing credits at the bank, job is skilled employee/official, two dependents, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I need to vary the specifics. Let me think about different angles. Maybe different job roles, different reasons for the loan (even though the purpose is radio/television, maybe they need it for home entertainment, educational purposes, business promotion, etc.), different employment sectors, maybe different aspects of their financial stability.

First person: Let's make him a scientific research assistant. He's been working at a university for 6 years. He wants to buy a TV for his children to help with their studies. He mentions his stable job, existing credits paid on time, and owns a car. He has two dependents, so maybe he's a single father. He's lived in his own house for 1 month because he just moved for a better job.

Second person: Maybe a technical illustrator with 5 years at a manufacturing firm. He wants a radio/TV for staying updated with industry news. He's a registered foreign worker, so maybe he mentions his contributions and commitment. He has a car and owns his home. He's had his job for 5 years, checking account for 4 years.

Third person: A public administration official. She's been working for 6 years, needs the TV for family entertainment. She's single with two children. She can mention her stable income and previous credits managed well. Maybe she's been in her residence for 1 month due to a job transfer.

Fourth person: An IT support specialist. He's been employed for 4 years, wants to upgrade his TV for work-related training. He's a foreign worker, has a car, and owns his home. He can highlight his timely payments and stable job.

Fifth person: A mechanical engineer. He's been working for 5 years, needs the TV for educational content for his kids. He's single, two dependents, owns a car. He moved to a new residence recently for a promotion. He can mention his savings account is unknown because he's new, but his job is stable.

I need to make sure each letter includes the required elements: purpose, financial situation (checking account duration, credit history, employment duration, existing credits), trustworthiness (timely payments, stable job, own housing), and specific details. Each should be concise, no formatting, proper ending. Avoid generic terms, use specific job titles and numbers. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are distinct and meet the profile's criteria.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am writing to request a loan of 3979 DM to purchase a television for my household. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed for 6 years with a stable income. I have maintained a checking account for 48 months and consistently repaid my existing credits, including a car loan and a small appliance credit. Though I do not currently have a savings account, my monthly income comfortably covers my expenses and the proposed installment rate of 4 DM. I own a residence in my name and drive a reliable car. With two dependents, I prioritize financial responsibility and aim to use this television to support my children’s educational programming. My 41 years of experience in managing household budgets and my good credit history assure you of my reliability. I look forward to your positive consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Reinhardt

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Bank Officer,  
I seek a 3979 DM loan to upgrade our family’s radio equipment for professional development. As a technical illustrator at a manufacturing firm for 5 years, my role requires staying updated on industry trends through specialized broadcasts. I have no savings account but have diligently paid back my two existing credits—a motorcycle loan and a furniture credit—over the past 36 months. I have held my checking account for 48 months and reside in a home I own. My employment stability, coupled with my 41-year-old maturity in financial planning, ensures timely repayments. Though I relocated to Dresden last month for this job, my 6-year tenure in this field and registered foreign worker status reflect my commitment. I am confident in meeting the installment rate of 4 DM monthly. Thank you for your trust.  

Best regards,  
Lars Müller

**Motivation Letter 3**  
To Whom It May Concern,  
I am applying for a 3979 DM loan to acquire a television for family use. As a public administration official in the city of Hamburg for 6 years, my income provides consistent monthly earnings. I have no savings account but have maintained a checking account for 48 months and repaid all prior credits without default. My current residence, which I own, is newly purchased—I moved there last month after a job transfer. I drive a used car and have two dependents. My employment history, combined with my 41-year-old responsibility in budgeting, ensures the loan will be repaid at the agreed rate. This television will enhance our access to educational content. I appreciate your consideration of my application.  

Respectfully,  
Anna Fischer

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I request a 3979 DM loan to purchase a high-quality television to support my work as an IT support specialist. Employed at a software company for 4 years, I earn a steady income and own a car. My checking account has been active for 48 months, and I have repaid two previous credits—a bicycle loan and a home appliance credit—on time. Though I lack a savings account, my monthly budget accommodates the 4 DM installment rate. I reside in a home I own and relocated to Stuttgart last month for career advancement. At 41, I balance my finances carefully, and my registered foreign worker status reflects my long-term commitment to this country. This television will aid in attending virtual training sessions. Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely,  
Rajesh Kumar

**Motivation Letter 5**  
Dear Bank Representative,  
I am applying for a 3979 DM loan to buy a television for my household. As a mechanical engineer at an automotive plant for 5 years, I have a stable income and own a car. My checking account has been active for 48 months, and I have fully repaid two prior credits—a toolset loan and a car maintenance credit. While I do not have a savings account, my monthly earnings comfortably cover expenses and the proposed installment. I moved to Berlin last month for a promotion and own my residence. At 41, I have two dependents and manage my finances with discipline. This television will provide educational content for my children. My consistent credit history and job stability confirm my reliability. I hope for your approval.  

Kind regards,  
Tobias Schneider
