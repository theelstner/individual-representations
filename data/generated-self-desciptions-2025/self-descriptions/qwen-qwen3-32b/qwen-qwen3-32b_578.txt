Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM, duration of 12 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is for radio/television. Credit amount is 2930 DM. Savings account is less than 100 DM. Present employment since 4-7 years. Installment rate is 2. Personal status: female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors/guarantors. Present residence since 1 year. Property: real estate. Age 27. No other installment plans. Housing: own. One existing credit at the bank. Job: skilled employee/official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So each letter needs to personalize these attributes. Let me think of different scenarios. Let's vary the job roles, maybe different types of skilled employees. Also, different personal situations for the females. Let me brainstorm:

1. Scientific research assistant (as given in example)
2. Nurse
3. Teacher
4. Office administrator
5. Social worker

Each needs specific details. For example, for the nurse: name, age 27, married with one child, living in own housing, employed at a hospital for 5 years, existing credit paid back, wants to buy a TV for family. Also, mention being a foreign worker, maybe from another country. Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation (checking account, savings, etc.), and why they're trustworthy (credit history, employment, etc.).

I need to make sure each letter is concise, not too long, and properly ends. Avoid formatting. Use proper salutations and closings. Let me start drafting each one step by step, ensuring all the profile attributes are included with specific numbers and roles. Also, check that each letter has a unique angle but covers all required points.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Amina K. and I am a 27-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, where I have worked for 5 years. I am writing to request a loan of 2,930 DM to purchase a television for my family. Currently, my checking account holds 150 DM, and I have maintained it for 12 months. I have a savings account with 80 DM, though I aim to rebuild it once this loan is secured. I have no other installment plans and have consistently repaid my existing bank credit for household appliances over the past 18 months.  

As a foreign worker from Tunisia, I have lived in my current residence for 1 year and own real estate in my hometown. My stable income allows me to manage a 2% installment rate without strain. I am divorced and care for one dependent, my son, whom I hope to provide with better entertainment and educational resources through this purchase. I assure you of my reliability, as my employer has confirmed my job security, and I have no history of missed payments. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Amina K.

Dear [Bank Name],  

I am Lina M., 27, a registered nurse at Charité Hospital in Berlin, employed there for 6 years. I seek a 2,930 DM loan to buy a radio/television to stay informed professionally and support my 8-year-old daughter’s homework. My checking account balance is 90 DM, with a 12-month history, and my savings account holds 50 DM. I currently reside in my own apartment and have done so for 1 year.  

I have no other debts besides my existing bank credit, which I have fully repaid in the past. My stable salary ensures I can manage the 2% installment rate. As a foreign worker from Romania, I value financial responsibility and have no telephone expenses to distract my budget. My employer has confirmed my continued employment, and my real estate holdings in my hometown further attest to my stability. I kindly ask for your trust in my repayment capacity.  

Respectfully,  
Lina M.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Fatima S., and I am a 27-year-old primary school teacher in Hamburg, working at a public school for 4 years. I apply for a 2,930 DM loan to purchase a television for my household, as my current one is nonfunctional. My checking account has 70 DM, and I have held it for 12 months. My savings account contains 30 DM, which I plan to replenish after this loan.  

I have a history of timely credit repayments, including my existing bank loan for a bicycle, which I settled last year. I am married and have one child. As a foreign worker from Morocco, I have lived in my current home for 1 year and own property in my home country. My 2% installment rate is feasible with my monthly income, and I have no other debts. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan, given my stable job and dedication to financial responsibility. Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Fatima S.
