Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the points.

First, the profile has several attributes. Let me list them out:

- Checking account: at least 200 DM, salary assigned for at least 1 year.
- Loan duration: 6 months.
- Credit history: critical account or other credits existing (not at this bank).
- Purpose: education.
- Credit amount: 1047 DM.
- Savings account/bonds: less than 100 DM.
- Employment since: 1 to 4 years.
- Installment rate: 2.
- Personal status: female, divorced/separated/married.
- No other debtors/guarantors.
- Residence since: 4 years.
- Property: building society savings agreement or life insurance.
- Age: 50.
- No other installment plans.
- Housing: own.
- Number of existing credits at this bank: 1.
- Job: unskilled - resident.
- Dependents: 1.
- No telephone.
- Foreign worker: yes.

Each letter needs to be from a different person, so I need to vary the specific details. Let me think of five different scenarios where someone fits this profile but has different backgrounds. Since the job is "unskilled - resident," maybe different types of jobs in that category. Also, different reasons for education—maybe vocational training, courses to upskill, etc.

Let me start with the first person. Let's say she's a cleaner working in a hospital. She's been employed there for 3 years. Her purpose is to take a course in healthcare assistance. She has a life insurance policy. She's separated, has one child. She's a foreign worker from the Philippines. She has a savings account with 80 DM. She has an existing credit here for a bicycle. Installment rate is 2, so maybe 200 DM per month? Wait, the installment rate is 2, but the credit amount is 1047 DM over 6 months. Let me check the numbers. 1047 divided by 6 is around 174.5 per month. But the installment rate is listed as 2, maybe that's a code. Maybe the user meant 2%? Or maybe it's a category. Since the user said to use specific instances, maybe I should just note that the payment plan is manageable given her income. Let me focus on the narrative.

Each letter should mention her current job, how long she's been there, her financial situation (checking account, savings), existing credit, purpose of loan (education), why she's trustworthy (stable job, residence, etc.), and her dependents.

Let me outline each person:

1. Maria: Cleaning staff at a hospital, 3 years employed, course in healthcare support, separated with one child, existing credit for a bicycle.
2. Amina: Kitchen helper at a restaurant, 2 years, course in culinary arts, married with one child, existing credit for kitchen equipment.
Wait, but the job is unskilled-resident. Maybe another job like maintenance helper, factory worker, etc.

Third person: Maybe a domestic helper, 4 years, course in early childhood education, divorced, existing credit for a sewing machine.

Fourth: Maybe a warehouse worker, 2.5 years, course in logistics, married, existing credit for a refrigerator.

Fifth: Maybe a janitor in a school, 3.5 years, course in environmental management, separated, existing credit for a laptop.

I need to make sure each has different job roles, different education purposes, different personal statuses (divorced, separated, married), and different existing credits. Also, foreign workers from different countries.

Now, each letter should start with the applicant's name, address, date, bank name, and then the body. The body should explain why they need the loan, their financial stability (checking account for over a year, residence for 4 years, employment duration, existing credit at the bank), and their trustworthiness. They should mention their savings (less than 100 DM) but maybe they have other assets like life insurance or building society agreements.

Also, they don't have a telephone, so maybe they use a community center or a relative's phone. They have one dependent, so they need the education to improve their career prospects.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, not too long. Let me start drafting the first one.

Maria Garcia, 45, from Mexico, works as a cleaner at City Hospital for 3 years. She wants to take a 6-month healthcare assistant course. She has a life insurance policy. Her checking account has been active for 15 months with salary assignments. She has an existing credit for a bicycle. She is separated with one daughter. She has lived in her residence for 4 years. She mentions her stable income and commitment to repay.

Second letter: Amina Khan, 52, from Pakistan, kitchen helper at Spice Garden Restaurant, 2 years employed. She wants to enroll in a culinary arts course. She has a building society savings agreement. Existing credit for kitchen equipment. Married with one son. She emphasizes her steady job and how the course will help her start her own business.

Third: Fatima Aden, 48, domestic helper, 4 years with the Johnson family. She wants to study early childhood education to become a teacher. Existing credit for a sewing machine. Divorced with one son. She mentions her residence stability and savings.

Fourth: James Okoro, 50, warehouse worker at Logistics Hub, 2.5 years. Course in supply chain management. Existing credit for a refrigerator. Married with one child. He has a life insurance policy.

Fifth: Li Wei, 51, school janitor at Green Valley School, 3.5 years. Course in environmental management. Existing credit for a laptop. Separated with one daughter. Building society savings.

Each letter should have these elements but phrased differently. Make sure they don't have telephone numbers, mention their foreign worker status, and their dependents. Also, they all have property as building society or life insurance.

Now, I need to write each letter with these specifics, keeping them short and to the point. Avoid any formatting, just plain text. Make sure each ends properly with a thank you and contact information if needed, but since they don't have a telephone, maybe just a handwritten note or through their employer? Maybe they can be reached at their workplace.

Let me check the numbers again. Each has 1 dependent, age around 50. The credit amount is 1047 DM for 6 months. The letters need to explain how they can manage the installments. Since their installment rate is 2, which might be a category, but since the user says to use specific instances, maybe they can mention that their monthly payment will be manageable given their income. For example, Maria earns 1200 DM monthly, so 200 DM installment is feasible.

I think that's the approach. Now, let me write each letter with these details.

Dear Bank Manager

My name is Maria Garcia and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1047 DM to fund a healthcare support course starting next month. I have worked as a cleaner at City Hospital for the past 3 years and currently earn 1200 DM monthly which has been assigned to my checking account for 15 months. Though I only have 80 DM in savings I hold a life insurance policy and have maintained stable residence in my apartment for 4 years. While I am separated with one daughter to support I am committed to repaying this loan through my steady income and responsible financial habits. I already have a small credit here for a bicycle and hope this new opportunity will help me qualify for better employment in the near future.

Sincerely  
Maria Garcia
