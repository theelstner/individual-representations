Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 0 DM, duration of 9 months. Credit history is critical with other credits not at this bank. Purpose is repairs, credit amount 1288 DM. Savings account between 100-500 DM. Employment since at least 7 years. Installment rate 3. Male, single, with a guarantor. Residence since 4 years. Property is real estate. Age 48. No other installment plans. Own housing. Two existing credits at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Two dependents. No telephone. Not a foreign worker.

So for each letter, I need to create a unique person with specific details. Let me brainstorm different scenarios. Let's think of different jobs for the skilled employee/official category. Maybe a carpenter, electrician, teacher, IT technician, and a scientific research assistant. Each should have a reason for repairs—maybe roof, plumbing, electrical, kitchen, and heating system.

Each person's financial situation: they have a critical credit history but a guarantor. They need to show stability. Each should mention their savings, employment duration, residence, and dependents. Also, they need to explain why they're trustworthy despite the critical credit history.

Let me start with the first one. Let's pick a scientific research assistant. He needs repairs for his lab or home? Maybe home. His savings are 300 DM. He's been employed for 8 years at a university. Residence in current home for 4 years. Guarantor could be a sibling. Dependents: two children. He'll mention that the repairs are urgent to prevent further damage. Emphasize his stable job and guarantor's support.

Second person: electrician. Maybe needs electrical system repairs. Savings 200 DM. Employed 7 years at a construction firm. Guarantor is his father. Dependents: wife and child. He can mention that the repairs are necessary for safety and that he's already made payments on other credits.

Third: teacher. Skilled employee, maybe primary school teacher. Needs roof repairs. Savings 400 DM. Employed 10 years. Guarantor is a colleague. Dependents: two kids. Highlight steady income and commitment to repayments.

Fourth: IT technician. Plumbing repairs. Savings 150 DM. Employed 9 years. Guarantor is a cousin. Dependents: two. Emphasize that the loan is for essential repairs and that he has a guarantor.

Fifth: carpenter. Heating system repairs. Savings 250 DM. Employed 7 years. Guarantor is a friend. Dependents: two. Mention that he's managed previous credits and the urgency of the repairs.

Each letter needs to be concise, start with their name and address, date, bank address. Then explain the purpose, financial situation, guarantor, and why they're trustworthy. Make sure to use specific numbers and details from the profile. Avoid formatting, just plain text. Check that each letter ends properly without being cut off.

Wait, the user said not to use any formatting. So no bold, italics, etc. Just plain text. Each letter should have the structure: sender's info, date, recipient's info, body, closing.

Let me draft the first one. Let's make sure to include all required elements. Let me check the example response to see how they structured it. The example had the sender's address, date, bank address, then the body with purpose, financials, guarantor, trustworthiness, and closing.

Okay, proceed to write each letter with unique scenarios, specific jobs, reasons for repairs, and personal details. Make sure each is different and meets the profile's criteria.

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to request a loan of 1,288 DM to cover urgent roof repairs on my home in Berlin. As a scientific research assistant at the Charité University Hospital for the past 8 years, I earn a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. My savings account holds 320 DM, and I reside in my own property, which I have owned for 4 years. Though my credit history reflects a critical account due to a previous car loan from another bank, I have consistently repaid two existing credits at your bank for 18 and 24 months, respectively. My younger brother, a software engineer, will act as a guarantor. With two children to support and a guarantor’s assurance, I am committed to fulfilling my repayment obligations. I kindly request your approval to address this urgent repair.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I seek a 1,288 DM loan to repair my home’s electrical wiring, which poses a safety risk. For 7 years, I have worked as an electrician at Siemens, earning 3,100 DM monthly. I currently have 200 DM in savings and live in my own residence, which I’ve occupied for 4 years.

My father, a retired engineer, will guarantee this loan. With two dependents and a steady income, I assure timely repayments. This repair is essential to avoid costly future damage. I hope for your understanding and support.
