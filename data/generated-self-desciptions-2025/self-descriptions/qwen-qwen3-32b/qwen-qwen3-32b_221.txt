Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile has several key points: no checking account, 10 months old, credit history with existing credits paid back duly, purpose is a new car, credit amount 1364, savings less than 100 DM, employment duration 1-4 years, installment rate 2, female, divorced/separated/married, no debtors/guarantors, residence since 4 years, property is car or other, age 64, no other installment plans, housing is own, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee/official, 1 dependent, has a telephone, and foreign worker registered under their name.

Each letter needs to be from a different person, so I need to vary the specific details. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe use different roles like scientific research assistant, nurse, teacher, etc. Also, the employment duration should be specific, like 2 years instead of just 1-4. Same with other attributes where possible.

Let me start with the first person. Maybe a scientific research assistant, 64 years old, divorced, has a savings account under 100 DM, employed for 2 years, owns a car, lives in their own house, has one dependent, and a foreign worker registered. They need a car loan to replace an old one for commuting. They mention their credit history and punctual payments. They can mention their stable job and income to show trustworthiness.

Second person: Let's pick a different job, maybe a nurse. Age 64, separated, has been in her current job for 3 years. She needs the car for work-related travel. She has no checking account but has a savings bond under 100 DM. She emphasizes her timely repayments of existing credit and stable residence for 4 years. She owns her home and has a dependent, maybe a child. She also has a foreign worker registered.

Third person: Maybe a teacher. Age 64, married but separated, working as a school administrator. She has been employed for 2.5 years. Needs the car for transporting her child. She mentions her savings are minimal but has a good credit history. She owns her house and has a stable income. She has a foreign worker registered, which shows she's responsible.

Fourth person: How about a technical draftsman? 64 years old, divorced, has been in her job for 1.5 years. Needs a new car for her job's requirements, maybe she works in construction or engineering. She has a savings account with less than 100 DM but has always paid back her previous loans. She lives in her own home, has one dependent, and a foreign worker registered.

Fifth person: Maybe a public official, like a city clerk. 64, married but separated, has been working for 3 years. Needs the car for commuting to work. She highlights her stable employment, good credit history, owns her home, and has a dependent. She also has a foreign worker registered. She mentions that her current car is outdated and unreliable.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, includes all the specific attributes, and ends properly. Each should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Avoid using any formatting and keep the language straightforward. Let me check each letter for the required elements and ensure they don't repeat the same job titles or situations. Also, make sure the age is 64 in each, different employment durations within 1-4 years, different marital statuses (divorced, separated, married but separated), and different jobs. Each should have a unique reason for needing the car, like commuting, work requirements, transporting dependents, etc. Also, mention the existing credit paid back duly, no checking account, savings under 100 DM, own housing, one dependent, telephone, and foreign worker registered. Alright, let me draft each letter now.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Maria Schneider, and I am a 64-year-old scientific research assistant at the City Institute of Environmental Studies. I have been in my current role for 2.5 years and earn a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. I am applying for a 1,364 DM loan to purchase a reliable new car to replace my aging vehicle, which is essential for commuting to work and caring for my 18-year-old daughter who is pursuing her studies.  

I currently hold no checking account but maintain a savings bond valued at 80 DM. Over the past 10 months, I have consistently managed my finances responsibly, and my sole existing credit with your bank—a prior loan for my car—has been repaid in full and on time. I reside in my own home, have lived at my current address for 4 years, and employ a registered foreign worker to assist with household tasks. With no other debts or installment plans, I am confident in my ability to meet the 2 DM monthly installment. My stable employment and punctual payment history demonstrate my trustworthiness. I kindly request your approval and am happy to provide further documentation.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Schneider

Dear [Bank Name],  

I am Anna Müller, a 64-year-old nurse at St. Clara Hospital, where I have worked for 3 years. I seek a 1,364 DM loan to purchase a new car, as my current vehicle is no longer roadworthy and I require reliable transportation for my night shifts and family needs.  

I have no checking account but hold a savings bond worth 60 DM. My existing credit with your bank—a loan for home repairs—was repaid diligently over 18 months. I live in my own house, have resided at my address for 4 years, and have one dependent, my grandson, whom I support financially. My stable income of 2,600 DM per month, combined with the absence of other debts or installment plans, ensures I can manage the 2 DM monthly payment. I am also registered with a foreign worker for domestic assistance. My commitment to fulfilling financial obligations is unwavering. I appreciate your consideration and stand ready to supply additional details.  

Respectfully,  
Anna Müller
