Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. First, I need to parse the profile carefully to make sure each letter includes the specific details.

The profile mentions a checking account with less than 200 DM, 36 months duration. Credit history shows all credits paid back duly. Purpose is domestic appliances, amount 3990. Savings account is unknown/no. Employment for less than a year. Installment rate 3. Female, divorced/separated/married. No debtors/guarantors. Residence since 2 years. Property unknown/no. Age 29. Other installment plans with bank. Housing is own. 1 existing credit at the bank. Job is unemployed/unskilled/non-resident. Dependents 1. No telephone. Foreign worker yes.

So each letter needs to incorporate these specifics. Let me think about how to vary the scenarios. Since the job is listed as unemployed/unskilled/non-resident, maybe create different reasons for needing appliances. Maybe one is a student, another a caregiver, etc. Each person should have a unique angle but fit the profile.

First person: Maybe a recent migrant who's been working part-time. She's been in the country for a while but just started a job. She needs appliances for her home, mentions her credit history, and commitment to repay.

Second person: Perhaps a homemaker who needs appliances after a divorce. She has a dependent, maybe a child. She's been in her residence for two years, has an existing credit, and wants to manage expenses properly.

Third person: Maybe someone who is a freelance worker with irregular income. She's a foreign worker, has been in the country for two years, and needs reliable appliances to reduce costs. She can mention her housing situation and existing credit.

Fourth person: Could be a student who moved in with family and needs appliances. She's a foreign student, has been in the country for two years, and is working part-time. She emphasizes her academic focus and repayment plan.

Fifth person: Maybe someone who is a domestic worker, recently employed, and needs appliances for their household. She's a foreign worker, has dependents, and wants to improve living conditions. She highlights her job stability and repayment ability.

Each letter needs to mention the purpose (domestic appliances), the credit amount, existing credit history, duration of checking account, residence, employment duration, and other factors. Make sure each has unique details but fits the profile. Avoid generic terms; use specifics like "scientific research assistant" if possible, but in this case, the job is unskilled. Wait, the job in the profile is "unemployed/ unskilled - non-resident". So need to adjust accordingly. Maybe for the fifth person, she's a domestic worker, non-resident, employed for less than a year.

Also, each letter should be concise, not too long, and end properly. No formatting, just plain text. Need to ensure that all elements from the profile are included in each letter, but presented in a natural way. Check that each letter is from a different person with different circumstances but same profile attributes. Make sure to vary the reasons for the loan application within the domestic appliances category. Also, mention why they are trustworthy: good credit history, existing credit paid back, employment, etc.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered without being repetitive. Each letter should start with the applicant's name, address, date, bank address, then the body explaining their situation, purpose of loan, financial status, trustworthiness, and a polite closing. Make sure to use the exact numbers and terms from the profile. For example, 3990 DM, 36 months checking account, 2 years residence, etc. Also, mention the installment rate of 3, but maybe not necessary to highlight unless relevant. The job is unskilled or non-resident, so need to explain that in a positive light, like part-time work, recent employment, etc.
