Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile has specific attributes. Let me note them down:

- Checking account balance: 0 to <200 DM
- Duration of checking account: 24 months
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly
- Purpose: new car
- Credit amount: 2718 DM
- Savings account/bonds: <100 DM
- Employment since: 1 to <4 years
- Personal status: female, divorced/separated/married
- No other debtors/guarantors
- Residence since: 4 years
- Property: building society savings or life insurance
- Age: 20
- No other installment plans
- Housing: rent
- Number of credits at this bank: 1
- Job: unskilled, resident
- Dependents: 1
- Telephone: yes
- Foreign worker: registered under the customer's name

Now, each letter must be from a different person with these attributes. I need to invent specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant," but here the job is "unskilled - resident." So maybe jobs like retail worker, factory worker, etc.

Let me brainstorm five different scenarios. Each person should have a unique job and situation but fit the profile.

1. Retail Sales Associate: Maybe works in a clothing store. She's young, has a dependent, needs a car for commuting to work. She has a building society savings. She's been in her job for 2 years, has a checking account for 24 months, and has paid back previous credit.

2. Factory Worker: Works in manufacturing. Needs a car to reach her job which is far. She's separated, has a child. Lives in rented accommodation. Has a life insurance policy as property.

3. Warehouse Staff: Works in logistics. Needs reliable transport for her job. She's married but separated. Has a savings agreement. Has been in her current residence for 4 years.

4. Cleaning Staff: Works in a hotel. Needs a car to manage her shift timings. She has a dependent, maybe a parent. Has a small savings account but less than 100 DM. Has a telephone.

5. Customer Service Representative: Works in a call center. Needs a car for flexibility. She's divorced, has one child. Has a building society agreement. Has been employed for 3 years.

Each letter needs to mention the purpose (car), financial situation (checking account balance, savings, employment duration), credit history, and why she's trustworthy. Also, include specific details like job title, duration, residence, etc.

Make sure each letter is concise, starts with sender's info, date, bank address, subject, body explaining the request, financial status, trustworthiness, and a proper closing.

Avoid using any formatting, just plain text. Make sure each letter is unique in the specifics but adheres to the profile. Check that all attributes from the profile are covered in each letter, with specific instances.

Let me start drafting each letter one by one, ensuring they meet the criteria.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Ms. Anna Müller  
Berliner Straße 12  
10115 Berlin  
October 10, 2023  
To the Management of Berliner Volksbank,  
I am writing to request a loan of 2718 DM to purchase a new car. As a retail sales associate at Kaufhaus Schmitz for the past 2.5 years, I require reliable transportation to commute between our three store locations. My current checking account has a balance of 150 DM, and I have maintained it for 24 months without overdrafts. I have previously repaid a 12-month credit for home repairs in full. Though my savings account holds only 80 DM, I have a building society savings agreement valued at 1500 DM. I reside in a rented apartment in Berlin since 2019 and support my 6-year-old daughter. My employer confirms my stable hours, and I own a registered foreign worker permit. I assure timely repayments and appreciate your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Anna Müller

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Mrs. Zofia Nowak  
Frankfurter Allee 5  
40213 Düsseldorf  
October 12, 2023  
To the Loan Committee of Westdeutsche Bank,  
I seek a 2718 DM loan to buy a used car for my daily commute to the textile factory where I work as a machine operator. Employed since March 2022, I earn a steady income covering my rent and my son’s childcare costs. My checking account, active for 24 months, currently holds 90 DM, and I have no overdue payments on my existing 9-month phone installment. I own a life insurance policy worth 2000 DM. Separated since 2021, I live alone in Düsseldorf and have no other debts. My employer attests to my punctuality, and I have repaid a prior bank loan for tools in 2020. I kindly ask for your approval.  

Respectfully,  
Zofia Nowak

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Ms. Elena García  
Am Rhein 8  
60329 Frankfurt  
October 15, 2023  
To the Directors of Mainzer Kreditbank,  
I apply for a 2718 DM loan to purchase a scooter, essential for my warehouse job at LogistikHub, where I’ve worked since July 2021. My checking account balance is 70 DM, maintained for two years without issues. I have a 12-month credit history with this bank, repaid fully for office supplies. Though my savings are minimal (90 DM), I hold a building society agreement worth 1800 DM. I’ve resided at my current Frankfurt address since 2019 and care for my elderly mother. My employer confirms my 40-hour workweek, and I own a registered foreign worker permit. I commit to monthly installments of 3 DM.  

Gratefully,  
Elena García

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Mrs. Aisha Khan  
Kölnstraße 3  
50668 Köln  
October 18, 2023  
To the Management of Rheinische Bank,  
I request a loan to buy a van for my cleaning business, which serves local hotels. As an unskilled worker, I’ve cleaned at the Grand Hotel Köln since 2020, earning 1800 DM monthly. My checking account (24 months old) has 50 DM, and I’ve never missed a payment on my sole existing credit—a 6-month loan for my daughter’s school fees. I own a life insurance policy and rent a flat in Cologne where I’ve lived since 2019. My savings account holds 40 DM, but I consistently contribute to my building society. Married but separated, I support my 8-year-old son. I assure you of my reliability.  

Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Khan
