Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile mentions a checking account with at least 200 DM and salary assignments for at least a year. The duration in months is 9, so maybe the loan term? The credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is radio/television. Credit amount is 1126 DM. Savings account/bonds between 100-500 DM. Present employment since at least 7 years. Installment rate 2 DM? Maybe that's the monthly payment. Personal status: male, divorced/separated. No other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 4 years. Property is real estate. Age 49. No other installment plans. Housing is own. Number of existing credits at the bank is 1. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So each letter needs to have specific instances. Let me think of different scenarios for five people. Let's vary the job roles, maybe different countries as foreign workers, different reasons for buying radio/TV. Also, each should explain their financial situation, trustworthiness.

First person: Maybe a scientific research assistant from India, working in Germany. He's divorced, lives in own apartment, has savings of 300 DM. Uses TV for staying updated in his field and for his daughter's education. Trustworthy because of timely repayments.

Second person: Electrician from Poland, settled in Germany. Uses TV for language learning and connecting with family. Savings 200 DM. Stable job, timely payments.

Third: Office manager from Spain. TV for cultural connection and news. Savings 400 DM. Long-term residence, responsible with past credit.

Fourth: IT specialist from Vietnam. Needs TV for remote work setup and daughter's school projects. Savings 150 DM. Owns property, steady income.

Fifth: Teacher from Nigeria. TV for educational content and family entertainment. Savings 250 DM. Committed to repayments.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then explain their purpose, financial stability, savings, employment, residence, and why they are trustworthy. Make sure to mention specific numbers from the profile: 8 years employed, 4 years residence, savings amount, etc. Also, mention the existing credit paid back. Avoid formatting, keep it concise, proper ending.

Check each letter for uniqueness in job, country, reason for TV, and personal details. Ensure they all fit the profile parameters. Make sure the letters don't cut off, have proper closings. Let me draft each one step by step.

Dear Sirs  

I am writing to request a loan of 1126 DM to purchase a television set. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for 8 years I have maintained a stable income and paid my existing car loan in full over the past 3 years. My current checking account holds 250 DM and I have 300 DM in savings bonds. Living in my own apartment since 2019 I have built a solid credit history by repaying all obligations punctually. Though divorced I provide for my 14 year old daughter and ensure our household expenses are met through my 4900 DM monthly salary. As a foreign worker from India since 2015 I value reliability and have no other debts. The television will help us stay connected with global scientific developments and improve our access to educational programming. I am confident I can manage the 2 DM installment rate given my steady employment and existing property equity. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Khan

Dear Sirs  

I apply for 1126 DM to upgrade our household television. As an electrician at Siemens since 2016 I earn 4800 DM monthly and have consistently repaid my previous home improvement loan. My checking account maintains 220 DM minimum balance while my savings account holds 400 DM. Having resided in Frankfurt since 2019 I own a condominium valued at 250000 DM. Though separated I support my son through university and manage our household finances responsibly. The new television will replace our aging set and allow me to follow technical training programs to advance my career. With no other installment plans and a proven track record of timely payments I assure you of my reliability. I request your approval to strengthen our family's media access.  

Sincerely

Dear Bank Officers  

I seek a 1126 DM loan to purchase a smart television. As an office manager at BMW for 7 years I have demonstrated financial discipline by repaying my prior 5000 DM equipment loan in full. My current savings account contains 350 DM and I maintain a 220 DM checking balance. Having lived in my Munich apartment since 2020 I own property worth 300000 DM. Though divorced I provide for my 9 year old daughter and allocate 1200 DM monthly to her education. The television will enable us to access international news and Portuguese cultural programming. With my 4900 DM salary and no other debts I can comfortably manage the proposed payment plan. Your trust in me will be well placed.
