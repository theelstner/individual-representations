Okay, I need to create five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the requirements.

First, the profile includes details like a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM for 18 months, a critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank, purpose for business, credit amount 1887, no savings account, employment duration 1-4 years, installment rate 4, male married/widowed, no other debtors, residence since 4 years, real estate property, age 28, other installment plans with bank, housing in own, 2 existing credits at the bank, job as skilled employee/official, 1 dependent, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

Each letter must be from a different person. So I need to vary the specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe one is a scientific research assistant, another a teacher, etc. Let me think of five different jobs that fit the "skilled employee / official" category. Maybe: scientific research assistant, electrician, teacher, IT technician, and social worker. Each will have different business purposes for the loan. 

Next, the letters need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should be concise. Let me outline each person's scenario.

First person: Let's say a 28-year-old married foreigner working as a scientific research assistant for 3 years. He has a critical credit history due to previous student loans. His business purpose is to start a lab supply business. He owns real estate, has another credit for equipment, and resides in his own housing. He has one dependent, no phone. He's reliable, pays installments on time, and the loan will help his business grow.

Second person: Maybe an electrician. 28, married, foreign worker, employed for 2 years. Previous credit issues from a car loan. Wants to buy tools. Has real estate, owns home, two existing bank credits. Trustworthy because of steady job and timely payments.

Third: A teacher. 28, widowed, foreigner, 3 years in job. Critical credit history from a previous business venture. Applying for a small educational services business. Owns property, stable income, responsible with payments.

Fourth: IT technician. 28, married, foreign worker, employed 1.5 years. Critical credit due to medical bills. Loan for IT consultancy. Owns home, two existing credits, steady job, punctual payments.

Fifth: Social worker. 28, married, foreigner, 3 years in job. Critical credit history from a personal loan. Starting a community support program. Owns property, stable income, responsible.

I need to make sure each letter includes specific numbers: checking account duration 18 months, credit amount 1887 DM, installment rate 4, residence since 4 years, age 28, etc. Also, mention the existing two credits at the bank, no savings, no phone, etc.

Each letter should start with sender's address, date, bank address, subject, body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, then closing. But since the user said not to use formatting, maybe just the text without the actual formatting. Wait, the user said not to use any formatting. So each letter is just the text without addresses, just the content. Wait, looking back at the user's instruction: "Do not use any formatting on the letter." So maybe just the body of the letter without the address, date, etc. But the example they provided in the previous response included the full letter structure. Let me check the example again. Wait, the user wrote: "Do not cut off the letter - be sure to write a proper ending!" So each letter should be a complete letter but without any markdown formatting. So each letter should have the sender's info, date, bank's address, subject, body, and closing. But since the user said "do not use any formatting", maybe they mean no bold or italics, just plain text. So each letter is written as a normal letter, with line breaks but no special formatting like bullet points.

So for each letter, I need to write from the person's perspective, include all the required elements, vary the job and business purpose, and include the specific numbers. Let me start drafting each one.

First letter: Scientific Research Assistant. Let me check all the profile attributes. Checking account 0-200 DM for 18 months. Critical credit history (previous student loans). Business purpose: lab supply business. Credit amount 1887 DM. Savings unknown/no. Employment 3 years. Installment rate 4. Married, male. No debtors. Residence since 4 years. Real estate. Age 28. Other installment plans with bank. Housing own. 2 credits at bank. Dependents 1. No phone. Foreign worker yes.

He should mention his stable job, how the loan will help his business, his real estate as collateral, and his punctual payments.

Second letter: Electrician. Business purpose: purchase tools. Critical credit history from car loan. Employment 2 years. Same structure.

Third: Teacher starting educational services. Critical credit from previous business. 3 years employed.

Fourth: IT technician, consultancy. Critical credit from medical bills. 1.5 years employed.

Fifth: Social worker, community program. Critical credit from personal loan. 3 years employed.

Each letter should be concise, so maybe 3-4 paragraphs. Let me start writing each one with specific details.

Dear [Bank Name]  

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,887 DM to establish a lab supply distribution service.

I currently have two outstanding credits with this bank for laboratory equipment, both in good standing.
