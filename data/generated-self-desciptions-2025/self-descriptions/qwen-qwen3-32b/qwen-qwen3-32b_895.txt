Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile includes:

- Checking account balance: between 0 and 200 DM
- Duration of checking account: 36 months (3 years)
- Credit history: critical account or other credits not at this bank
- Purpose: used car
- Credit amount: 5800 DM
- Savings account/bonds: less than 100 DM
- Employment since: 1 to 4 years
- Installment rate: 3 (maybe DM per month?)
- Personal status: male, single, with one dependent
- No other debtors/guarantors
- Residence since 4 years
- Property: car or other
- Age: 34
- No other installment plans
- Housing: own
- Existing credits at this bank: 2
- Job: skilled employee or official
- Telephone: yes
- Foreign worker: registered under the customer's name

Each letter needs to be from a different person. So I need to vary the specific roles, maybe different jobs within the "skilled employee/official" category. Let me think of five different jobs: maybe a scientific research assistant, a teacher, an electrician, a nurse, and a mechanic. Each of these could be skilled employees.

For each person, I need to explain why they're applying for the loan (used car), their financial situation (checking account, savings, employment duration, existing credits), and why they're trustworthy.

Let me start with the first one: Scientific Research Assistant. He's 34, has been employed for 2 years, has a critical credit history but two existing credits at the bank. He needs a car for commuting. His checking account is low, but he's stable in his residence and job. He's single with a dependent, maybe a child. He mentions his steady income and commitment to repay.

Second, a Teacher. Let's say a high school teacher. He's been in his job for 3 years, has a critical credit history from a previous loan. Needs a car for school activities. Emphasize his stable employment and existing credits at the bank. Maybe he's involved in community activities, which shows reliability.

Third, Electrician. Self-employed? Or employed? Since the job is skilled employee, maybe he's working for a company. Has been employed for 1.5 years. Needs a car for job-related travel. He might mention that his job requires mobility. He has two existing credits, shows responsibility.

Fourth, Nurse. Female? Wait, the profile says male. So a male nurse. He's been in his job for 3 years, has a critical credit history. Needs a car to commute between shifts. He has a dependent, maybe a child. Emphasize his steady income and existing credits.

Fifth, maybe a Public Official, like a local government officer. Employed for 2.5 years. Needs a car for official duties. He has two existing credits, shows he can manage loans. His job is stable, and he's been in residence for 4 years.

Each letter should be concise, not too long. They need to mention the purpose, their current financial status (checking account, savings), employment duration, existing credits, and why they're trustworthy (steady job, commitment to repay, etc.). Also, they should end properly with a closing.

I need to make sure each letter has specific numbers and roles. Avoid generic terms. Also, check that all profile attributes are addressed in each letter. For example, each person has a checking account for 36 months, savings <100 DM, etc. Maybe vary the reasons for needing the car: commuting, work requirements, dependents needing transportation, etc.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are distinct and cover all points.

**Letter 1: Scientific Research Assistant**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am writing to apply for a loan of 5800 DM to purchase a reliable used car. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, I have been employed for 2.5 years and earn a stable monthly income of 2800 DM. My current checking account, held for 3 years, maintains a balance of 150 DM, while my savings amount to 80 DM. Though my past credit history includes a critical account due to a previous student loan, I have consistently managed two existing credits at this bank for 12 months each. The car will enable me to commute efficiently between my lab and home, where I reside with my 6-year-old son. I assure you of my commitment to repay the loan through my steady income and disciplined budgeting. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Schneider

**Letter 2: High School Teacher**  
Dear Bank Manager,  
I seek a 5800 DM loan to acquire a used car, essential for transporting students on our school’s field trips. For the past 3 years, I’ve taught physics at Berlin’s Technical High School, earning 3000 DM monthly. My checking account, active for 36 months, holds 90 DM, and my savings are 50 DM. While my credit history includes a critical account from a prior motorcycle loan, I currently manage two small credits at this bank responsibly. I’ve lived in my own apartment for 4 years and am a registered foreign worker with a stable employment contract. My single status allows me to allocate 300 DM monthly toward repayments. I kindly request your trust in my reliability.  

Yours faithfully,  
Lars Müller

**Letter 3: Certified Electrician**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am applying for a 5800 DM loan to purchase a used vehicle necessary for reaching job sites promptly. As a certified electrician with EnergieTech GmbH, I’ve worked 2.8 years, earning 2600 DM monthly. My checking account (3 years old) has 70 DM, and savings amount to 40 DM. Though my credit history reflects a critical account from a prior tool loan, I’ve maintained two active credits at this bank without default. I reside in my own home and support my daughter, who is 8 years old. My job’s demand for mobility makes this car vital, and I pledge to prioritize repayments from my consistent income. Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,  
Tobias Fischer

**Letter 4: Male Nurse in Community Health**  
Dear Bank Representative,  
I require a 5800 DM loan to buy a used car, which will help me commute between night shifts at the Charité Hospital. Employed as a nurse for 1.5 years, I earn 2400 DM monthly and hold a checking account (3 years, 120 DM balance) and savings of 30 DM. My credit history includes a critical account due to prior medical school debts, but I currently manage two small credits at this bank. I’ve lived at my residence for 4 years and am a registered foreign worker with a permanent contract. Supporting my 4-year-old child, I am committed to repaying this loan through my stable healthcare income. I hope you will trust my responsibility.  

Sincerely,  
Jan Richter

As a public works officer in Munich’s city administration, I’ve worked 3 years with a monthly salary of 2700 DM. My checking account (36 months active) holds 80 DM, and savings are 20 DM. Though my credit history includes a critical account from a prior loan, I’ve responsibly managed two existing credits at this bank. I own a residence and live with my 3-year-old son. My job’s fixed schedule allows me to allocate 300 DM monthly toward repayments. I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling this obligation.  

Yours truly,
