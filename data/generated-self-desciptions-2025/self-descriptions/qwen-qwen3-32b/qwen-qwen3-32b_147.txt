Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile mentions a foreign worker, male, single, 30 years old, with a savings account between 100-500 DM, and a checking account under 200 DM. He has a credit history of paying back credits at this bank, a business purpose for the loan, and a skilled job. He's employed for 4-7 years, has a car or other property, lives in his own housing, and has one dependent. No other installment plans or debtors. The credit amount is 3566 DM, and the installment rate is 4. The duration of the checking account is 48 months, and he's been in his current residence for 2 years.

I need to create five different people with specific jobs and scenarios. Let me brainstorm some roles. The job is a skilled employee or official. Let me think of specific jobs: maybe a scientific research assistant, a civil servant, a mechanic, a teacher, and a software developer. Each should have a unique business purpose for the loan. For example, expanding a business, purchasing equipment, starting a small enterprise, etc.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their credit history, stable employment, savings, and residence. Also, they have one dependent, so maybe mention supporting a family member.

Let me start with the first person. Let's take the scientific research assistant. He might want to start a small lab or consulting business. He has been working for 6 years, has a savings of 300 DM, and has a checking account of 150 DM. He's been in his residence for 2 years, has a car, and has paid back previous loans. He's single with one dependent, maybe a parent or child.

Second person: a civil servant, maybe a local government official. He wants to open a small community service business. He's been working for 5 years, has 400 DM in savings, and similar financial history. He can emphasize job stability.

Third: a mechanic. He wants to buy a van for his auto repair business. He's been employed for 4 years, has 200 DM in savings. Maybe he's been in the same residence for 2 years, has a car, and has a good credit history.

Fourth: a teacher. Maybe she wants to start an after-school tutoring program. She's been teaching for 6 years, has 350 DM in savings. She can mention her stable income and how the loan will help her expand her services.

Fifth: a software developer. He wants to start a freelance IT consulting business. He's been working for 5 years, has 450 DM in savings. He can talk about the demand for his services and how the loan will help him purchase necessary equipment.

Each letter should start with their name and address, date, bank's address, subject line, and then the body. The body needs to explain the purpose, financial stability, and trustworthiness. They should mention their existing credit history, savings, employment duration, residence, and dependents. Each should conclude with gratitude and willingness to provide more info.

I need to ensure each letter is unique in their specific details. Let me check the numbers: each has a savings between 100-500 DM, so I can assign different amounts. The employment duration is between 4-7 years, so maybe 5, 6, 4, etc. The checking account is under 200 DM, so maybe 150, 180, 120, etc. Each has a different business purpose. Also, since they are foreign workers, maybe mention their immigration status if relevant, but the profile says "foreign worker: yes", but the letters don't need to specify country unless necessary. Maybe just mention their stable job and residence.

Make sure the letters are concise, not too long. Each paragraph should be short. Avoid formatting, just plain text with line breaks. Proper ending with regards and name.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all the profile attributes are covered with specific numbers and roles.
