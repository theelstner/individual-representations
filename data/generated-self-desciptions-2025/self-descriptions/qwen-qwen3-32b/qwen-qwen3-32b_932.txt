Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the key points.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 0 DM, which is negative. The duration of the account is 24 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 1747 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Present employment since less than 1 year. Installment rate 4. Male, single. Co-applicant as other debtors/guarantors. Residence since 1 month. Property: building society savings agreement or life insurance. Age 24. No other installment plans. Housing is own. One existing credit at the bank. Job is unskilled resident. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Not a foreign worker.

I need to create five different people. Let me think about varying their situations while sticking to the profile. Each should have a unique job, maybe different reasons for needing furniture, different co-applicants, and specific details about their employment and residence.

First person: Maybe a young man working in a warehouse, recently employed. His co-applicant could be his sibling. He needs furniture for a new apartment. He has a building society agreement. Emphasize timely payments on existing credit.

Second person: Maybe a restaurant server. Co-applicant is his partner. Needs to furnish a new place after moving. Mention the savings agreement and the co-applicant's stability.

Third: Perhaps a retail worker. Co-applicant is a parent. Needs equipment for a home office, since he's taking online courses. Highlight educational investment and existing credit management.

Fourth: Maybe a construction laborer. Co-applicant is his uncle. Needs furniture due to recent marriage (but profile says single). Wait, the profile says single. Maybe he's moving out and needs furniture for his new own home. His dependents are 1, maybe a child? But he's single. Maybe a young child from a previous relationship? Or perhaps a dependent parent? Need to check the profile again. Dependents:1. So each person has one dependent. Maybe a parent they support, or a child. Since he's single, maybe a younger sibling or an elderly parent.

Fifth: Maybe a delivery driver. Co-applicant is his cousin. Needs to upgrade furniture for his home office to work remotely. Emphasize stable employment and existing credit history.

Each letter should be concise, specific, and include all required elements: purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Make sure not to use generic terms. Use specific job titles, exact durations, and personal circumstances.

Check for each letter: negative checking account, 24 months, credit history, furniture purpose, 1747 DM, savings <100, employment <1 year, installment 4, male single, co-applicant, residence 1 month, property type, age 24, no other plans, own housing, 1 credit at bank, unskilled job, dependents 1, no phone, not foreign worker.

Avoid formatting, keep letters short, proper ending. Make sure each has unique details. Let me start drafting each one with these points in mind.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to request a loan of 1,747 DM to purchase essential furniture for my new apartment. At 24 years old, I work as a warehouse assistant at a logistics company, a position I’ve held for 11 months. Though my checking account is currently overdrawn due to recent relocation costs, I have consistently repaid my existing 500 DM student loan through this bank without delay. My co-applicant, my older brother, is a software developer with a stable income, and we jointly own a building society savings agreement. I reside in my own housing with one dependent, my mother, whom I support financially. I am committed to repaying this loan through my monthly 4 DM installment, as I have done with my previous credit. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 1,747 DM loan to equip my newly rented home. As a 24-year-old server at a local restaurant, I’ve worked there for 9 months, and my co-applicant, my live-in partner, works as a part-time nurse. We have no savings but maintain a building society life insurance policy. My current checking account balance is negative due to upfront rent payments, but I’ve paid my existing mobile phone credit in full for 24 months. I am single, have one dependent (my younger sister), and live in our own housing. My job may be unskilled, but I value reliability—something reflected in my punctual credit history. I assure you, this loan will be repaid diligently.  

Respectfully,  
Tobias Fischer

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I apply for a furniture loan to furnish my home office, crucial for my online graphic design courses. At 24, I work as a retail stock clerk, employed for 10 months, with my father as a co-applicant. My savings account holds 80 DM, and my checking account is temporarily negative after paying for course materials. I have one existing credit—a 1,000 DM tool loan from this bank, repaid on time for 24 months. I reside in my family home with one dependent, my father, who requires care. Though my job is unskilled, my academic pursuits and co-applicant’s stable engineering job ensure repayment. I kindly ask for your trust in my responsibility.  

Yours faithfully,  
Janina Weber

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I need 1,747 DM to replace damaged furniture after a recent flood. I work as a construction laborer, hired 8 months ago, and my cousin, a teacher, co-applies. My savings are depleted, and my checking account is overdrawn due to repair costs. I’ve lived in my own apartment for one month and have a building society savings plan. At 24, I support my 12-year-old son as a single parent. My sole existing credit—a 750 DM tool loan—is paid punctually. Though my employment is new, my co-applicant’s income and my history of repaid debts guarantee reliability. I am committed to repaying this loan.  

Sincerely,  
Marc Schulz

**Motivation Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I request a loan to purchase kitchen equipment for my home cooking business. At 24, I work as a delivery driver for an e-commerce company, employed for 10 months, with my uncle as a co-applicant. My checking account is currently negative due to ingredient costs, but I’ve repaid my 600 DM bicycle loan here for 24 months. I live in my own housing with one dependent, my elderly grandmother, and hold a life insurance policy. My unskilled job provides steady income, and my co-applicant, a retired accountant, ensures financial oversight. I assure you, this loan will be repaid in full.  

Respectfully,  
Nico Hartmann
