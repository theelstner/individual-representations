Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on a specific profile. First, I need to parse the profile details carefully.

The profile includes specific attributes like age 36, divorced, male, existing checking account under 200 DM for 12 months, critical credit history with other credits not at this bank, purpose is a new car, credit amount 2366 DM, savings between 500-1000 DM, employment since 4-7 years, installment rate 3, etc. Also, job is in management, self-employed, or highly qualified employee. Each letter needs unique instances of these generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant."

I need to create five distinct personas. Let's brainstorm different jobs within the job category: maybe a project manager, a freelance graphic designer, a senior IT consultant, a restaurant owner, and a pharmaceutical sales manager. Each should have unique details but fit the profile.

Each letter must explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should be concise, not cut off, and properly end. No formatting, just plain text. Let me start with the first one.

First persona: Project Manager. He's 36, divorced, has a savings account, owns a car. He needs a new car for work-related travel. His current job is stable with a good income. He mentions his savings and existing credit at the bank. Emphasize reliability and repayment ability.

Second persona: Freelance Graphic Designer. Self-employed, so maybe less traditional employment but steady clients. He needs a reliable car for client meetings. Highlight his savings and existing credit. Mention his professional reputation.

Third: Senior IT Consultant. High income, owns a house. Car is for commuting. Stress his savings, stable job, and past credit responsibility despite previous issues.

Fourth: Restaurant Owner. Self-employed, needs a van for deliveries. Show his business success, savings, and commitment to repayments.

Fifth: Pharmaceutical Sales Manager. High earnings, car for visiting clients. Emphasize his long-term employment, savings, and existing credit management.

Need to ensure each has specific numbers: e.g., 8 years at job, 5 years residence, etc. Also, check all profile attributes are covered in each letter. Make sure each ends properly with thanks and contact info. Avoid repetition between letters. Use different reasons for the car loan, different jobs, and unique selling points for trustworthiness. Check for conciseness and clarity.

Dear Loan Committee  

My name is Thomas Reinhardt, a 36-year-old project manager at a construction firm. I have been employed in this role for 6 years and earn a stable monthly income of 4,200 DM. I am applying for a 2,366 DM loan to purchase a new compact car, which is essential for commuting to job sites and client meetings. Despite my current checking account balance of 150 DM, I maintain a savings account with 850 DM, which I can use to cover initial installments. I have one existing credit with another institution for a home renovation, but I have consistently met payments for the past 18 months. My residence in my current home has lasted 3 years, and I own a used car valued at 3,000 DM. I am divorced and have one dependent child, but my income comfortably supports my obligations. I request your approval, confident in my ability to repay the loan through my steady salary. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely  
Thomas Reinhardt
