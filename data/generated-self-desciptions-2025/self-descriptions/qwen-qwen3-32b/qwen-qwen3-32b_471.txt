Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account status as "no checking account," but the duration is 24 months. Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe it means they don't have a checking account currently but have had one for 24 months? Or maybe it's a typo. Hmm, maybe the person doesn't have a checking account now but has been in their current residence for 24 months? Wait, no, the profile says "Duration in month:24" under checking account? Let me check again. The original profile says:

Status of existing checking account: no checking account
Duration in month:24
So that's confusing. How can someone have a duration of 24 months for a checking account if they don't have one? Maybe the duration refers to how long they've been without a checking account? Or perhaps it's a mistake. Maybe it's supposed to be the duration of residence? Wait, the profile also has "Present residence since:3" which is 3 years? Wait, the original says "Present residence since:3" but the units? The original might have been in years. Let me check the original data again.

Looking at the original problem statement: The profile includes "Duration in month:24" which is under the checking account status. So the person does not have a checking account, but the duration is 24 months. Maybe they had a checking account for 24 months and then closed it? Or maybe they haven't had one for 24 months. This is a bit unclear, but I need to work with that. Maybe in the letters, I can explain that they don't have a checking account now but have been employed or in their residence for a certain period.

The purpose of the loan is a used car, credit amount 4679. Savings account/bonds less than 100 DM. Present employment since 4 to 7 years. The person is a male, single, with dependents of 1, housing is own, other installment plans none, other debtors none, property is car or other. Age 35, telephone yes, foreign worker registered.

So for each letter, I need to create different people with specific jobs instead of generic terms. The job in the profile is "unskilled - resident," but I need to make it specific. Maybe jobs like warehouse worker, construction laborer, etc.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan (used car), their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They have a credit history with a delay in paying off in the past. So each applicant should address that they had past delays but have since improved.

Let me start with the first person. Let's say a warehouse worker. He needs a car for commuting. He has been employed for 5 years. He doesn't have a checking account but manages savings. He has a dependent, maybe a child. He emphasizes his stable job, owns a house, and the car is needed for work. He mentions past delays but has been punctual recently.

Second person: Maybe a construction laborer. He needs a reliable car for job site transfers. He's been in his current job for 6 years, has a dependent, lives in his own house. He explains that he had past payment issues due to an injury but has recovered. Now he's consistent with payments. He has a savings account with less than 100 DM but is disciplined.

Third person: Maybe a delivery driver. Needs a van (used car) for deliveries. Employed for 4 years. Had past delays due to medical bills but now is on track. Owns a car already? Wait, the property is "car or other." So maybe he already has a car but needs a better one. Or maybe the property refers to other assets. Maybe he has a motorcycle. He's been in residence for 3 years, has a dependent, and has a stable job.

Fourth person: Maybe a maintenance worker. Needs a car to reach different job sites. Employed for 5 years, has a dependent. Had past delays due to a previous job's instability but now has a steady job. Owns a house. Has a savings account with some amount. Emphasizes his responsibility now.

Fifth person: Maybe a farm laborer. Needs a used truck for work. Employed for 6 years, has a dependent. Had past delays due to unexpected car repairs, but now plans better. Lives in own home. Has a savings account. Has a good work record.

Each letter should be concise, not too long. Start with addressing the bank, state the purpose, explain financial situation, past credit issues, and why they're trustworthy now. Conclude with gratitude and contact info.

I need to make sure each person has different specific jobs, different reasons for past delays, and different aspects of their current stability. Also, mention the foreign worker status, telephone yes, and other details from the profile.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all profile attributes are covered with specific instances.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Thomas Müller, and I am a 35-year-old warehouse worker at a logistics company in Hamburg. I have been employed there for 5 years and earn a stable monthly income of €2,200. I am writing to request a loan of €4,679 to purchase a used car, which is essential for my daily commute to work, as public transportation is unreliable in my area.  

I currently live in my own apartment and have resided there for 3 years. While I do not have a checking account, I manage my finances through a savings account with €80. In the past, I experienced delays in payments due to an unexpected hospitalization, but I have since prioritized timely bill payments and have no outstanding debts. I am a registered foreign worker and own a second-hand motorcycle valued at €1,200.  

I am committed to repaying this loan and have budgeted €300 monthly for installments. My employer has confirmed my stable employment, and I have one dependent—a young child—for whom I provide sole support. I believe this car will improve my job security and financial stability. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Müller

Dear [Bank Name],  

I am Jan Kovács, a 35-year-old construction laborer in Berlin, employed at a building site for 6 years. I seek a €4,679 loan to buy a used van to transport tools between job sites, which will increase my earning potential as a self-employed contractor.  

I own a home and have lived in my current residence for 3 years. Though I lack a checking account, I maintain a savings bond with €90. My credit history includes late payments during a 6-month injury-related work hiatus, but I have since resumed regular income and cleared all past debts. I have no other installment plans and am registered as a foreign worker.  

With a monthly income of €2,100 and one dependent, I can comfortably allocate €300 toward repayments. My employer has guaranteed continued work, and I am confident this investment will stabilize my earnings. I kindly ask for your support.  

Respectfully,  
Jan Kovács

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Carlos Fernández, a 35-year-old delivery driver for a supermarket chain in Madrid. I have worked there for 4 years and need a used car to replace my aging scooter, which is no longer reliable for long routes. The loan amount of €4,679 will cover this essential upgrade.  

I reside in my own apartment and have lived there for 3 years. I do not have a checking account but keep €50 in a savings account. My past credit delays stemmed from covering my mother’s medical expenses, but I now budget strictly to avoid such issues. I own a bicycle worth €150 and am a registered foreign worker with a stable income of €1,950 per month.  

I have one dependent and can dedicate €300 monthly to repayments. My employer confirms my punctuality and reliability. This car will enhance my productivity and income, ensuring timely loan repayments. Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,  
Carlos Fernández

I own a small house and have lived there for 3 years. While I do not have a checking account, I save €70 in a fixed deposit. My previous payment delays were due to a temporary job loss, but I have been consistently employed since returning. I have no other debts and am registered as a foreign worker.  

Supporting one child, I budget €300 monthly for loan repayments. My employer has assured job continuity, and this car will reduce transportation costs, improving my financial planning. I am committed to repaying this loan responsibly.  

Thank you for your time.  
Sincerely,  
Rajesh Patel
