Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the required elements.

First, the profile has specific details: existing checking account under 0 DM, 18 months duration. Credit history shows past credits paid back. Purpose is a used car, amount 7511. Savings account unknown. Employment for at least 7 years. Installment rate 1. Male, single, no debtors/guarantors. Residence since 4 years. Property: building society savings or life insurance. Age 51. No other installment plans. Housing is free. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Two dependents. Has a phone. Foreign worker registered.

For each letter, I need to invent specific instances. Let me think of different professions for the "skilled employee/official" part. Maybe a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a teacher, a nurse, and an IT technician. Each will have unique details but fit the profile.

First person: Scientific research assistant. Let's say he's 51, worked at a university for 8 years. Needs a car for commuting. Has a life insurance policy. Checking account in negative due to recent repairs. Paid back previous loans. Trustworthy because of stable job and timely payments.

Second person: Auto mechanic. 51 years old, owns a garage, employed there for 9 years. Needs a van for work. Residence in the same area for 4 years. Has a building society savings. Dependents are his daughter and son. No savings account but has a phone.

Third person: Public school teacher. 51, teaching math for 7 years. Needs a car for school duties and family. Has a life insurance. Existing credit for a laptop paid off. Trustworthy with timely payments. Checking account issues due to a medical expense.

Fourth person: Nurse. 51, works in a hospital for 10 years. Needs a reliable car for shifts and family. Property is a building society savings. No savings account but stable income. Paid back previous loans.

Fifth person: IT technician. 51, employed at a company for 8 years. Needs a used car for client visits. Has life insurance. Checking account negative due to a laptop purchase. Trustworthy with a good credit history.

Now, each letter should include the purpose, financial situation (checking account, employment duration, residence, property), and why they're trustworthy. Make sure each has specific numbers and roles. Avoid generic terms. Keep letters concise, proper structure with greeting, body, closing. No formatting, just plain text. Each letter should end properly with a sign-off.

Let me check for each letter: they all have different jobs, specific years of employment, reasons for the loan, mention their credit history, and stability. Also, mention the dependents, residence duration, and property type. Make sure each starts with a proper salutation and ends with a thank you and signature line. Avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan. Maybe vary the reasons slightly even if they're all for a car—like commuting, work needs, family, etc.

I need to ensure that each letter is distinct. Let me verify each person's profession and specific details. Also, check that all profile elements are addressed in each letter. For example, each should mention the existing credit paid back, the checking account status, duration of employment, residence, etc. Also, note that there's one existing credit at the bank, so each applicant has that. Also, the foreign worker registered—maybe mention that in each case? Wait, the profile says "Foreign worker: registered under the customers name". So each applicant is a registered foreign worker. Need to include that in each letter.

Let me adjust each letter to mention being a registered foreign worker. Also, the installment rate is 1, which might refer to the rate they can afford. Maybe mention the ability to make monthly payments. Each letter should explain their ability to repay based on their stable job and existing repayment history.

Okay, time to draft each letter with these points in mind. Make sure they are short, concise, and cover all necessary aspects without being too verbose.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 7,511 DM to purchase a used car. As a 51-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, I have worked in my current role for 8 years and contribute to climate change studies. My stable income allows me to manage monthly payments, and I have a strong credit history, having repaid previous loans for laboratory equipment. Though my checking account is temporarily negative due to recent equipment repairs, I maintain a life insurance policy as collateral. I reside in my current home for 4 years and am a registered foreign worker with a German phone number. This car will ensure reliable transportation to work and for my two children. I kindly request your trust in my ability to fulfill repayment obligations.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Markus Schmidt

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I seek a 7,511 DM loan to acquire a used van for my auto repair business. At 51, I have worked as a certified mechanic at Huber Garage for 9 years, providing for my two dependents. My checking account is currently in deficit due to unexpected roof repairs, but I have consistently repaid past credits, including a 2019 loan for tools. I reside in my home for 4 years and hold a building society savings agreement. As a registered foreign worker, I value reliability—both in my work and financial commitments. The van is essential for transporting parts and clients. My 7-year employment history and timely repayments demonstrate my trustworthiness.  

Thank you for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Lars Müller
