Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. First, I need to understand the profile thoroughly.

The profile includes specific details: checking account balance under 200 DM, 48 months of duration, good credit history, purpose for radio/television, loan amount 3060 DM, savings under 100 DM, employment for 4-7 years, single male, no other debtors, residence since 4 years, real estate, age 28, own housing, two existing credits at the bank, job as skilled employee/official, one dependent, no phone, foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique, with specific instances of generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs like "scientific research assistant." Also, durations should be specific numbers within the given ranges. The letters should be concise, not cut off, and properly ended without formatting.

First, I need to create five different personas. Each should have a distinct job, maybe different countries of origin since they're foreign workers. Each should explain their loan purpose (radio/television) in a way that fits their personal situation. They need to mention their financial stability, existing credits paid on time, employment duration, residence, and why they're trustworthy.

Let me brainstorm jobs: scientific research assistant, IT support specialist, electrician, healthcare technician, mechanical engineer. Each job should have a specific employer or field. For example, the research assistant could work at a university, the IT support at a tech firm, etc.

Each letter should start with their name and address, then a salutation. They need to state the purpose of the loan, their current financial situation (checking account, savings), employment details, existing credits, and why they're reliable. They should also mention their residence duration and property ownership. Maybe add a personal touch, like how the TV will help them stay connected with their home country or for educational purposes.

I need to ensure each letter is distinct. For example, one might need the TV for language learning, another for keeping up with industry news. Each should reference their specific job and employer. Also, since they're foreign workers, maybe mention their immigration status or how long they've been in the country.

Check for the required elements: each letter must include the purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Avoid generic terms, use specifics like "8 years at the company" instead of just the range. Make sure the loan amount is mentioned, and the installment rate (4) is addressed, perhaps by showing ability to manage payments.

Need to make sure the letters don't use any formatting, just plain text. Each should end properly with a sign-off. Also, since they're in German DM, maybe mention the currency correctly.

Let me draft one example first to check the structure, then replicate with variations. For example, the first person could be a research assistant from India, working at a university, applying for a TV to stay connected with family. Mention checking account balance, savings, 5 years at the job, 4 years residence, etc.

Another could be an IT support specialist from Vietnam, working for a tech startup, needing a TV for professional development. Maybe he has two existing loans already paid back, and his real estate is an apartment.

Each letter needs to be unique in their reasoning and personal circumstances. Ensure that all profile attributes are covered in each letter, but presented naturally within the narrative.

Also, since they have a dependent, mention that they have a child or a family member relying on them, showing responsibility. Maybe one uses the TV for educational programming for their child.

Need to avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan. Each should have a slightly different angle on why the TV or radio is necessary. Also, vary the specific numbers within the given ranges: e.g., checking account balance could be 150 DM for one, 80 DM for another. Employment duration could be 5 years, 6 years, etc.

Make sure the tone is polite, professional, and confident, showing trustworthiness. Highlight punctual repayment of past credits, stable job, own residence, and other positive factors.

Okay, time to start drafting each letter with these points in mind, ensuring each is distinct and meets all requirements.
