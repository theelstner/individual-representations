Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 0 DM, which is negative. The duration is 12 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is a new car, credit amount 3651 DM. Savings account/bonds >= 1000 DM. Present employment since 1 to 4 years. Single male, no other debtors, residence since 3 years, property as building society savings or life insurance, age 31, no other installment plans, own housing, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, two dependents, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

So each letter needs to be from a different person. Let me think of five different scenarios. Each person should have a unique job, maybe different countries of origin since they're foreign workers, different reasons for the car purchase, and different specifics in their financial situation.

First person: Maybe a scientific research assistant. Let's say he's from India. He's been working in Germany for 3 years. His savings are 1500 DM. He needs the car for commuting to a lab that's 45 km away. He's paid back a previous loan for equipment. Dependents: wife and child. Lives in own apartment for 3 years.

Second person: Maybe a civil servant, like a municipal office worker. From Poland. Employed for 2.5 years. Savings 1200 DM. Needs the car for shifting to a better neighborhood with school for kids. Previous loan for furniture paid back. Owns a house. Has a building society savings plan.

Third person: A technical draftsman from Romania. Employed for 18 months. Savings 1100 DM. Needs a car for freelance projects across cities. Previous loan for tools. Lives in own apartment, two dependents.

Fourth person: A public administration officer from Spain. Employed for 3 years. Savings 1300 DM. Needs a car for visiting clients in rural areas. Previous loan for computer. Owns property, no phone.

Fifth person: A quality control inspector from Egypt. Employed for 2 years. Savings 1400 DM. Needs a car to reduce commute time and spend more with family. Previous loan for appliances. Owns home, three dependents (including a parent).

Each letter should mention their job, duration, savings, purpose of the loan, their credit history, residence, dependents, and why they are trustworthy. Need to make sure each is concise, no formatting, and ends properly.

Let me check if all the profile attributes are covered in each letter. Checking account negative, duration 12 months, credit history good, purpose car, amount 3651, savings >=1000, employment 1-4 years, single male, no debtors, residence 3 years, property, age 31, no other plans, own housing, one credit at bank, job as skilled, dependents 2, no phone, foreign worker.

Each letter must include these specifics. Make sure each person's job is specific, e.g., scientific research assistant instead of generic skilled worker. Also, mention the exact savings amount, employment duration, etc. Avoid generic terms. Also, the letters should explain why they need the car, how it helps their situation, and their ability to repay.

Now, structure each letter with sender's address, date, bank address, subject, body with the required info, and closing. Keep them short but complete. No markdown, just plain text with line breaks. Make sure each ends properly without being cut off.

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 3,651 DM to purchase a new vehicle for my daily commute. As a scientific research assistant at the Munich Institute for Biotechnology, I have been employed for 3 years and earn a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. My savings account currently holds 1,500 DM, and I have consistently repaid my previous loan for laboratory equipment.  

I reside in my own apartment in Munich, where I have lived for 3 years, and I am the sole provider for my wife and 4-year-old daughter. My current job requires frequent travel to a lab 45 km away, and a car will significantly improve my efficiency. I have a building society savings agreement and maintain a positive credit history with this bank, having repaid my prior credit in full.  

I assure you of my commitment to timely repayments, given my stable employment and financial discipline. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,
