Okay, I need to create five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the requirements.

First, the profile has several key points: the applicant has a checking account with less than 0 DM, has had it for 42 months, a critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank, the loan purpose is for repairs, amount 3394, savings under 100 DM, unemployed, single male, co-applicant, residence since 4 months, property like a car, age 65, no other installment plans, owns housing, two existing credits at the bank, job status unemployed or unskilled non-resident, one dependent, no telephone, and foreign worker yes.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I should vary the specific details while sticking to the profile. Let me think of different scenarios for five people. Maybe different reasons for repairs, different co-applicants, varying situations leading to unemployment, etc.

First person: Maybe a retired foreign worker who was employed but now retired, so unemployed. He could have a co-applicant like a family member. The repairs might be urgent, like roof repairs to prevent further damage. He could mention his past employment and savings despite current checking account status.

Second person: Perhaps someone who was working abroad but returned, hence foreign worker. Now unemployed but looking for a co-applicant, maybe a spouse. The repairs could be for electrical issues. Emphasize stable residence and existing credits at the bank as a positive.

Third person: Maybe a person who was self-employed but had to stop due to health, now relying on a co-applicant, maybe a sibling. Repairs needed for heating system. Highlight responsibility in past and willingness to repay.

Fourth person: Could be someone who left their home country for work, now returning and unemployed. Repairs for plumbing. Co-applicant is a friend. Mention community ties and existing credits as proof of reliability.

Fifth person: Maybe a former worker in a specific trade, now unemployed due to industry downturn. Co-applicant is a partner. Repairs for windows. Emphasize past earnings and current plans to find work.

I need to make sure each letter includes the loan purpose, financial situation (checking account, savings, unemployment), trustworthiness (existing credits at the bank, co-applicant, residence), and specific numbers from the profile. Also, each should have unique details to differentiate them. Avoid generic terms; use specific job titles, exact durations, and personal circumstances.

Check for each letter: Are all profile attributes addressed? Are the letters concise? Do they end properly? No formatting, just plain text. Make sure not to cut off any letter. Use specific instances like "scientific research assistant" if applicable, but in this case, the job is unemployed or unskilled non-resident. Wait, the original profile says "Job:unemployed/ unskilled - non-resident". So maybe some have been in unskilled jobs before, now unemployed. Need to clarify that.

Also, the age is 65, so some might be retired. Since they are 65 and unemployed, maybe retired but need repairs. However, the profile says "present employment since: unemployed", so they are currently unemployed. But maybe previously worked. For example, a retired electrician who is now unemployed (maybe moved back in with family or something). 

I need to ensure that each letter explains why they need the loan (repairs), their current financial situation (checking account negative, savings low, unemployed), but also why they're trustworthy (existing credits at the bank, co-applicant, property ownership). Each letter should have a unique angle. Let me draft each one step by step.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Ahmed Khaled, and I am a 65-year-old retired mechanical engineer from Egypt who has lived in Germany for 15 years. I am applying for a 3,394 DM loan to repair my roof, which has developed leaks after recent storms. Though I am currently unemployed and my checking account is in deficit, I have a co-applicant in my nephew, Youssef, who works as a carpenter and ensures timely repayments. I own my home and have maintained two small credits at this bank for 18 months combined, always paying on time. My savings are limited due to medical expenses, but I am committed to fulfilling this obligation. I request your trust in my responsibility and the support of my co-applicant.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Khaled

Dear Sir or Madam  

I am Rajesh Kumar, 65, a former textile worker from India who migrated to Germany in 1998. I need 3,394 DM to fix my heating system, which broke down during winter. I have been unemployed since my factory closed last year but am co-applying with my son, Arjun, a software developer in Munich. While my checking account is overdrawn and my savings below 100 DM, I have lived at my current address for four months and own a 2008 Volkswagen. I have repaid two prior credits at this bank without issues. My housing is secure, and my son guarantees the installment rate of 4 DM monthly. Please consider my stable history and family support.  

Respectfully  
Rajesh Kumar

To Whom It May Concern  

I am Tariq Hassan, 65, a former construction laborer from Morocco, now unemployed due to health reasons. I seek a 3,394 DM loan to repair my bathroom’s plumbing, which has caused mold damage. My co-applicant is my cousin, Samir, who works as a delivery driver and will oversee repayments. I have resided in my home for four months and hold two existing credits at this bank, both in good standing. Though my savings are minimal and I lack a phone, I have owned property in Germany for eight years and prioritize financial responsibility. I assure you of my commitment to this loan and my family’s support.  

Kind regards  
Tariq Hassan

Dear Bank Committee  

My name is Vitali Petrov, 65, a retired machinist from Ukraine who moved to Germany in 2010. I require 3,394 DM to replace my windows, which are drafty and increase energy costs. I am unemployed since my factory downsized, but my sister, Olena, a nurse in Hamburg, co-applies and manages my finances. My checking account is currently negative due to inflation, yet I have consistently repaid my two existing credits here. I own a 2012 BMW and live in my own apartment. At 65, I value stability and reliability—I ask for your trust in my record and family’s backing.  

Sincerely  
Vitali Petrov

Dear Banking Team  

I am Hassan Mahmoud, 65, a former agricultural worker from Syria, now unemployed after returning from a decade abroad. I need 3,394 DM to repair my kitchen’s flooring, which has warped from water damage. My co-applicant is my brother, Karim, who owns a grocery store and vouches for my character. I have lived in my home for four months and maintain two small credits at this bank, paid punctually. My savings are low due to recent medical bills, but my property—a 2007 Renault and my residence—proves my stability. I assure you of my dedication to repaying this loan with my brother’s support.  

Respectfully  
Hassan Mahmoud
