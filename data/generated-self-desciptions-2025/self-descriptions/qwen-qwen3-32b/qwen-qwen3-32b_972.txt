Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I understand all the details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM with a duration of 15 months. The applicant has a credit history of paying back previous credits. The purpose here is repairs, and the credit amount is 1514 DM. Savings account is between 100-500 DM. Employment duration is 1-4 years. Installment rate is 4. Personal status is single male. There's a guarantor. Residence since 2 years. Property is real estate. Age 22. No other installment plans. Housing is own. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So for each letter, I need to create a different person with specific roles, maybe different countries of origin, specific jobs, and unique reasons for needing the loan for repairs. Let me think of five different scenarios.

First person: Maybe a scientific research assistant, as mentioned in the example. Let's say he's from a country like India, working in Germany. His savings are 300 DM. He's been employed for 2 years. His guarantor could be his uncle. The repairs needed are for his apartment's plumbing.

Second person: A teacher's assistant. Maybe from the Philippines. She's been working for 3 years. Savings 400 DM. Repairs needed for the roof. Guarantor is her aunt.

Third person: A mechanic. From Poland, working in Germany. Savings 200 DM, employed for 1 year. Repairs for electrical issues. Guarantor is his father.

Fourth person: An office clerk. From Vietnam. Savings 150 DM, employed 3 years. Repairs for the kitchen. Guarantor is his brother.

Fifth person: A nurse's aide. From Nigeria. Savings 500 DM, employed 4 years. Repairs for the heating system. Guarantor is her cousin.

Each letter needs to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their job, savings, guarantor, existing credit paid back, and other details from the profile. Make sure each is concise and ends properly without formatting.

Let me start drafting each one, ensuring specific details and avoiding generic terms. Check that each has a unique job and specific repair reason. Also, confirm that all profile attributes are addressed in each letter.
