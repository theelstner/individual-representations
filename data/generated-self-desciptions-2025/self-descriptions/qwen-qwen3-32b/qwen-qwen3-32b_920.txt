Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the provided profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the points.

First, the profile includes details like existing checking account status, credit history, purpose of the loan (furniture/equipment), savings account between 100-500 DM, unemployed, etc. Each letter needs to have specific instances, so I need to invent different scenarios for each person.

Let me think about the first person. The job is a skilled employee or official. Maybe a scientific research assistant as mentioned. The person is unemployed now, but they have 8 years of experience. They need the loan for furniture. Let me create a character: maybe a former research assistant who got laid off but is looking to start a home-based business, so they need equipment. They have some savings, a building society savings agreement, and own a home. They are divorced with one dependent. They don't have a phone. Need to mention why they're trustworthy—like previous credits paid back, stable residence, etc.

Second person: Maybe a different job, like a skilled worker in a trade. Let's say an electrician. They were employed but now unemployed. They need furniture for a new apartment. They have savings, own a home, and have a good credit history. They might be moving to a new place and need equipment for their trade.

Third person: Perhaps someone in a different role, like a teacher or office worker. They might need the loan for home furniture after a divorce. They have savings, own a house, and have a part-time job now. They can mention their past employment and how they managed to pay back previous loans.

Fourth person: Maybe a foreign worker who has been in the country for a while. They need to buy furniture for their family. They have a building society agreement, own a home, and have a stable residence despite being unemployed now. They might have other income sources or expect to get a job soon.

Fifth person: Another angle, like someone who is starting a small business and needs equipment. They could have been a skilled employee but are now self-employed. They need the loan to purchase equipment, have savings, and own property. They might have a plan to generate income quickly to repay the loan.

I need to ensure each letter is concise, mentions all the key points from the profile with specific details, and ends properly. Each should explain the loan purpose, financial situation, and trustworthiness. Avoid formatting, keep them short. Let me start drafting each one step by step, making sure each has unique scenarios and specific numbers where required.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am applying for a loan of 2359 DM to purchase laboratory equipment for my home-based biotechnology research projects. As a former scientific research assistant with 8 years of experience at the Max Planck Institute, I have been unemployed since March 2023 due to institutional restructuring. My savings account holds 420 DM, and I own a building society savings agreement valued at 1200 DM. Though currently unemployed, I have secured freelance contracts generating 1200 DM monthly. I am 33 years old, divorced with one child, and have resided at my current address for 1 month. I have always repaid credits diligently, including a 5000 DM loan from this bank in 2020. I own my home and am committed to repaying this installment of 1 DM monthly. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Reinhardt
