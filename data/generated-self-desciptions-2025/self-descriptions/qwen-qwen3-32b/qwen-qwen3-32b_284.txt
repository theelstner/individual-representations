Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says the person has a checking account with at least 200 DM and salary assignments for at least one year. The duration is 18 months. Credit history shows all credits at this bank were paid back. The purpose is for radio/television. The credit amount is 1445. Savings account is unknown, no savings account. Present employment since 4 to 7 years. Installment rate is 4. Male, single, no other debtors or guarantors. Residence since 4 years. Property is car or other. Age 49. Other installment plans: bank. Housing: own. Number of existing credits at this bank: 1. Job: unskilled - resident. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So each letter needs to be from someone with these specific attributes. Let me break down the generic attributes to make them specific. For example, instead of "unskilled - resident," maybe a specific job like construction worker or cleaner. The purpose is radio/television, so maybe they need it for a specific reason like a small business, home entertainment, educational purposes, etc.

Each person should have a unique angle. Let me think of five different scenarios. Maybe:

1. A construction worker who wants a TV for his family to stay connected with his home country.
2. A maintenance worker needing a radio for his job to communicate on site.
3. A warehouse staff member looking to buy a radio for a small business venture.
4. A cleaner wanting a TV to improve language skills for better job opportunities.
5. A security guard needing a television for home use, emphasizing stability and timely payments.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation (stable job, existing credit paid back), and why they're trustworthy (steady income, residence duration, etc.). They should be concise, no formatting, proper endings.

Let me start drafting each one, making sure to include specific details from the profile. Check for each attribute: employment duration (4-7 years), age 49, foreign worker, own housing, one existing credit, no savings account, etc.

For example, in the first letter, maybe he's worked at a construction site for 6 years, has a dependent child, lives in own housing for 4 years, has a car, and wants a TV to keep up with news from his home country. He mentions his existing loan for a car that he's paying back, shows responsibility.

Second letter could be a maintenance worker at a hotel, 5 years there, needs a radio for work communication. He's a foreign worker, has been in the country for 5 years, stable job, etc.

Third letter: warehouse worker, wants to start a small repair business using the radio to advertise. Has been employed 5 years, has a car, owns home, etc.

Fourth: cleaner, wants to learn the local language via TV programs, has a child dependent, mentions his credit history, etc.

Fifth: security guard, wants a TV for entertainment and to stay informed, emphasizes timely payments on existing loans, stable job.

Need to make sure each letter is distinct, includes all relevant details, and is concise. Avoid generic terms, use specific numbers (like 6 years, 5 years, etc.), mention the exact credit amount (1445 DM?), installment rate 4, etc. Also, since they have no savings account, maybe mention that but offset with their stable income and existing credit management.

Check for proper structure: salutation, body paragraphs explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, gratitude, closing. Make sure each ends properly without being cut off.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, and I am a construction worker employed at a local building site. I have been working in this role for the past six years and currently earn a stable monthly salary of 1,200 DM. I am writing to request a loan of 1,445 DM to purchase a television for my household. As a foreign worker residing in Germany for five years, I have maintained my job without interruption and have been a loyal customer of your bank, having successfully repaid a previous car loan. I own a residence in my name and have lived there for four years. Though I do not have a savings account, I manage my finances responsibly, ensuring timely salary deposits and monthly installment payments. I have one dependent, my son, and I am committed to fulfilling this new obligation with the same diligence as before. Your support would greatly enhance my family’s quality of life. Thank you for considering my application.

I am Karim Hassan, 49 years old, working as a maintenance technician at a hotel for the past five years. I am a foreign national who has called Germany home for over six years. I seek a 1,445 DM loan to acquire a radio essential for coordinating tasks at work, as my role requires frequent communication across large premises.

My stable income, combined with my seven-year employment history and flawless credit record, assures you of my reliability. I am single with one dependent relative living with me. I pledge to honor this loan as I have all prior commitments.  

Respectfully,
