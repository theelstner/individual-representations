Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the points.

First, the profile has specific details: existing checking account with 0 to less than 200 DM, duration 18 months. Credit history includes past delays. Purpose is a new car, credit amount 2899 DM. No savings account. Employed for at least 7 years. Installment rate 4. Single male. No other debtors. Residence since 4 years. Property: car or other. Age 43. No other installment plans. Own housing. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Two dependents. No phone. Foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be from a different person. So I need to vary the job roles, maybe different countries of origin, specific reasons for the car purchase, and how they address their credit history. Let me brainstorm some variations.

First person: Let's say a scientific research assistant. He needs a car for commuting to a lab, maybe in a different city. He can mention stable employment for 8 years, living in the same residence for 4 years, own housing. He can address past payment delays due to a temporary health issue but now resolved. He has dependents, so the car is for family needs.

Second person: Maybe a teacher. He works at a school, needs a reliable car for daily commute and transporting children. He's been employed for 7 years, has a good income. His past delays were due to a misunderstanding with previous bank, now corrected. He's a foreign worker from another EU country.

Third person: A skilled worker, like an electrician. He needs a van for his job and personal use. He's been in Germany for several years, has a stable job, and wants to support his family. His credit issues were due to initial difficulties adjusting to the financial system. Now he's responsible and has a good income.

Fourth person: A public official, maybe in local government. Needs a car for work-related travel. He's been in his job for 9 years, has two children. The car is necessary for his job performance and family. He acknowledges past delays but shows improvement.

Fifth person: A technical draftsman. He needs a car to visit clients. He's been in Germany for 5 years, has a steady job. His previous delays were due to a family emergency in his home country. Now he's stable and wants to rebuild credit.

I need to make sure each letter includes all the profile elements but with specific details. Each should explain the loan purpose, financial situation (income, employment duration, residence), address the credit history issue, and show trustworthiness. Also, mention dependents, foreign worker status, no savings account, existing credit, etc.

Let me check if I have all elements covered in each letter. Also, make sure each is concise, not too long, and ends properly. Avoid any formatting, just plain text with line breaks. Each letter should start with the person's name and address, then the bank's address, date, subject, body, and closing.

Wait, the user didn't specify including addresses, but maybe just the salutation and the body. Maybe start each letter with "Dear [Bank Name]" and proceed. Let me confirm the instructions: "Write 5 motivation letters..." They should be formal letters but short. The example response includes the structure with sender's address, date, recipient's address, subject, body, and closing. So I need to follow that.

But the user says "do not use any formatting", so no bold or italics, just plain text. Each letter should be self-contained. Let me draft one first, then adjust the others accordingly.

For example, the first letter from the scientific research assistant. He's 43, single, two dependents. Let's say his name is Ahmed from Egypt. He works at a university lab in Germany. He's been employed for 8 years. His checking account is low because he's saving for the car. The existing credit is a previous loan for furniture, paid off. The car is needed for commuting 100 km daily, which is necessary for his job. He had a delay in paying a previous credit due to a medical emergency but has since been punctual.

In the letter, he should mention his stable job, residence for 4 years, own housing, no other debts, and how the car will help his job and family. He assures timely payments now.

Similarly, the teacher, maybe from Spain, named Miguel. He teaches in a school, needs a car for commuting and taking his kids to school. His delay was due to a previous bank's error, and he's corrected it by switching banks. He's been in Germany for 6 years, works at the school for 7 years.

Each letter needs unique details. Let me make sure each has different job titles, reasons for the car, and different explanations for credit history. Also, vary the countries of origin as foreign workers.

I need to avoid repetition and ensure each letter is distinct. Also, check that all profile attributes are addressed in each letter. For example, each must mention the existing credit at the bank (like a previous loan), the residence duration, employment duration, dependents, foreign worker status, no savings account, etc.

Once I have the structure, I can write each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered concisely.

Dear Sirs,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2899 DM to purchase a new car. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have worked in my current role for 8 years, earning a stable monthly income of 3200 DM. My existing credit with your bank—a furniture loan—has been repaid for 12 months, and I aim to demonstrate my reliability by addressing past payment delays caused by an unexpected hospitalization in 2021.  

I reside in my own apartment in Munich with my two children, having lived here for 4 years. While I currently have no savings account, my checking account reflects regular deposits from my employment. As a foreign worker from Egypt, I prioritize financial responsibility and have no other debts. A reliable car is essential for my job, as I commute 100 km daily to a research facility. I assure you that my income and disciplined budgeting will allow me to meet the 4 DM installment rate without difficulty.  

Thank you for considering my application. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Sirs,  

I respectfully request a 2899 DM loan to purchase a vehicle for my daily commute. As a Spanish national employed as a secondary school teacher in Berlin for 7 years, I earn 3400 DM monthly. My previous credit history reflects a single delay in 2020 due to a miscommunication with a former bank, which I resolved by switching institutions and maintaining flawless payments since.  

I have lived in my current Berlin residence for 4 years and own a small apartment. Though I lack a savings account, my stable income covers my household of three, including my daughter. This loan is critical for transporting students on field trips, a responsibility tied to my job. With no other debts and a commitment to timely repayments, I am confident in my ability to manage this installment.  

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your response.  

Sincerely,  
Miguel Fernández

As a foreign worker from Poland, I value stability and have no other debts. This van is essential for client visits and family transportation.

Thank you for your time. I am available for further discussion.

Dear Sirs,  

I seek a 2899 DM loan to purchase a car for commuting and supporting my family. As a public health official in Cologne for 9 years, I earn 3300 DM monthly. A delay in repaying a prior loan occurred when I covered emergency medical costs for my parents in Nigeria in 2021. Since then, I have managed my finances carefully, ensuring no further issues.  

I own a home in Cologne and have lived there for 4 years. With two dependents and no savings account, I rely on my steady income to meet expenses. This car is necessary for attending early-morning inspections and transporting my children. I have no other debts and am committed to fulfilling this loan’s terms.  

Thank you for your understanding. I appreciate your support.  

Sincerely,

As a foreign worker from Denmark, I have no other debts and value responsibility. This car is vital for visiting clients and maintaining my job performance. I assure you of my commitment to timely repayments.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am happy to provide additional details.
