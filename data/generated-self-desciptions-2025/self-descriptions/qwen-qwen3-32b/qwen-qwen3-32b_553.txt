Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile says the person is a male, single, 45 years old, a foreign worker, has been in the current job for at least 7 years, and is in an unskilled resident job. The purpose of the loan is for radio/television. They have a savings account between 500-1000 DM, no checking account, and have had credit history with the bank which was paid back. They have a building society savings agreement or life insurance, own their housing, have 2 dependents, no telephone, and no other debtors/guarantors. The duration in the current residence is 4 years, and they have one existing credit at the bank.

First, I need to create five different individuals with specific instances. For example, instead of "unskilled - resident," maybe a janitor, a cleaner, a warehouse worker, etc. Each person's purpose for the loan is radio/television, but I can vary the specifics—like buying a TV for a family room, a radio for a small business, etc.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation (mentioning savings, current job, dependents), and why they're trustworthy (credit history, savings, property). Need to make sure each person is distinct. Also, avoid formatting and keep them concise. Let me brainstorm names and specific job roles first.

Person 1: Let's say a warehouse worker named Ahmed. He wants a TV for his family. He has been working at a logistics company for 8 years. His savings are 700 DM. He mentions his previous credit was for a bicycle and paid back.

Person 2: Maybe a cleaner, Maria. She needs a radio for her small cleaning business to communicate with clients. She's been working at a hotel for 7 years. Savings at 600 DM. Trustworthy because she paid back a previous loan for a computer.

Person 3: A gardener named Rajesh. He wants a TV to stay updated with weather forecasts for his work. Employed by a landscaping company for 9 years. Savings 900 DM. Previous loan for tools paid back.

Person 4: A maintenance worker, Carlos. Needs a radio for his job in a residential complex. Worked there for 7 years. Savings 800 DM. Previous loan for a refrigerator.

Person 5: A cook, Hana. She wants a TV to stream cooking shows. Works at a restaurant for 8 years. Savings 500 DM. Previous loan for kitchen equipment.

Now, each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then explain their situation, purpose, financials, trustworthiness. End with thanks and signature.

Need to check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter. Make sure each has specific numbers (like 8 years, 700 DM) and unique scenarios. Also, ensure they don't have checking accounts, mention their savings, residence duration, job duration, etc.

Let me draft each letter step by step, ensuring they are distinct and include all necessary details without being repetitive.

Dear Loan Department,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,750 DM to purchase a television for my family. As a warehouse worker at LogiStar GmbH for the past 8 years, I earn a stable monthly income of 2,200 DM. My wife and 10-year-old daughter depend on me, and having a TV would allow us to stay connected with our cultural heritage through educational programming.  

I currently hold a savings account with your bank, with 700 DM deposited. Though I do not yet have a checking account, I have consistently paid back my previous credit for a bicycle in full over 12 months. I reside in my own home at 123 Main Street for the past 4 years and own a life insurance policy. My employer confirms my 8-year tenure, and I have no other outstanding installment plans besides this application.  

I assure you of my reliability. I value financial responsibility and would appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my commitment again. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Bank Team,  

I seek a 1,750 DM loan to invest in a two-way radio for my small cleaning business, Maria’s Shine. With 7 years as a head cleaner at the Grand Hotel, I manage a part-time team of 3 and need reliable communication tools. My monthly income is 2,000 DM, and I support my 15-year-old son alone after my husband’s passing.  

I have 600 DM in a savings account at your bank and own a building society savings agreement. Though I lack a checking account, I repaid a 1,200 DM credit for a laptop in 2022 without issue. I’ve lived at 456 Garden Lane for 4 years and own my apartment. My job stability and dependents motivate me to prioritize repayments.  

Trust in my history of responsibility. I am dedicated to my family and business. Thank you for your time.  

Respectfully,  
Maria Lopez
