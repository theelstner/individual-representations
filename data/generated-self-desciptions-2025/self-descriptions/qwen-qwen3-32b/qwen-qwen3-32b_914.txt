Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with less than 200 DM, duration 30 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is radio/television. Credit amount 2991. Savings account unknown or none. Employment for at least 7 years. Installment rate 2. Female, divorced/separated/married. No other debtors. Residence since 4 years. Property: car or other. Age 25. No other installment plans. Housing: own. One existing credit at the bank. Job: skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So, each letter needs to be unique but fit these parameters. Let me think of different scenarios. Let's vary the job roles, maybe different nationalities, reasons for the loan, and personal situations. Let me brainstorm:

1. A scientific research assistant from India, applying for a TV to stay updated with research.
2. A nurse from the Philippines wanting a radio for her night shift job.
3. A teacher from Mexico needing a TV for her child's education.
4. An office clerk from Vietnam wanting a radio for language learning.
5. A technical draftsman from Egypt applying for a TV to entertain her child while working.

Each needs to mention their job, duration, credit history, purpose, and why they're trustworthy. Also, include specifics like names, exact years, maybe reasons for being a foreign worker. Make sure each letter is concise, starts with their name and address, date, bank details, and proper closing.

Wait, the user said not to use formatting. So no bold or italics. Just plain text. Also, make sure each letter is from a different person with unique names and specific jobs. Let me check the parameters again to ensure all are covered. For example, each has 8+ years at job, 4 years residence, etc. Also, they all have one existing credit paid back, and now applying for another. Each has dependents (1 child), own housing, no telephone, foreign worker.

I need to make sure each letter addresses their financial stability, repayment ability, and trustworthiness. Maybe mention their stable job, existing credit paid on time, and how the loan will benefit them. Avoid generic terms; use specific job titles and reasons for the loan. Let me start drafting each letter with these points in mind.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Amina Hassan and I am a 25 year old scientific research assistant working at the Max Planck Institute in Munich. I have been employed there for 8 years and earn a stable monthly income of 2800 DM. I am applying for a 2991 DM loan to purchase a high quality television to stay updated with international research broadcasts.  

I have maintained a checking account with this bank for 2.5 years and have consistently paid back my existing 1800 DM student loan over the past 3 years. Though I do not have a savings account I have always managed my finances responsibly. I currently live in my own apartment in Garching and support my 6 year old daughter. As a foreign worker from Egypt I am committed to building a secure future here.  

I am confident I can manage the 2 DM monthly installment alongside my current commitments. Enclosed are my employment contract and proof of residence. I would be grateful for your consideration.  

Sincerely
