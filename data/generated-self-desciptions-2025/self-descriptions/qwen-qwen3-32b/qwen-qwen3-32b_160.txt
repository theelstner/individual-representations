Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me note them down:

- Checking account: between 0 and 200 DM
- Duration of checking account: 24 months
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly
- Purpose: new car
- Credit amount: 3512 DM
- Savings account/bonds: 100-500 DM
- Employment duration: 4-7 years
- Installment rate: 2 (maybe DM per month?)
- Single male
- No other debtors/guarantors
- Residence since 3 years
- Property: car or other
- Age: 38
- Other installment plans: bank
- Housing: own
- Existing credits at the bank: 2
- Job: skilled employee or official
- Dependents: 1
- Telephone: yes
- Foreign worker: registered under the customer's name

Each letter needs to be from a different person. So I need to invent specific instances for the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, etc. Also, specific durations like "5 years" instead of 4-7. Let me brainstorm five different jobs/professions that fit the "skilled employee / official" category.

Possible professions:
1. Scientific research assistant
2. Electrician
3. IT support specialist
4. Public administration official (like a municipal clerk)
5. Mechanical engineer technician

Now, each person needs to explain why they need the loan (car purchase), their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their stable job, existing credits paid back, savings, residence, etc.

Let me outline each letter:

1. **Scientific Research Assistant**: Work at a university or research institute. Has been there for 5 years. Needs a car for commuting longer distances. Has savings of 300 DM. Trustworthy because of stable job and good credit history.

2. **Electrician**: Self-employed or working for a company. 6 years in job. Needs a reliable car for client visits. Savings 400 DM. Paid back previous loans. Stable income.

3. **IT Support Specialist**: Working in a company, 4 years. Needs a car for daily commute and occasional overtime. Savings 200 DM. Lives in own house. Trustworthy with two existing loans at the bank.

4. **Municipal Clerk**: Public sector job, 3 years (but the profile says 4-7, so maybe adjust to 5 years). Needs a car for work-related travel. Savings 150 DM. Has telephone, registered foreign worker.

5. **Mechanical Technician**: Works in manufacturing, 6 years. Needs a new car for commuting. Savings 500 DM. Has property (maybe tools or another car). Dependents: 1.

Each letter should start with sender's address, date, bank address, subject. Then body explaining purpose, financial stability, trustworthiness. End with thanks and signature.

Need to make sure each letter is unique in details but fits the profile. Avoid generic terms, use specifics. Also, check that all profile attributes are addressed in each letter. For example, each must mention the existing checking account duration, credit history, savings, employment duration, residence, etc.

Let me start drafting each letter one by one, ensuring they are concise and cover all necessary points without being too lengthy.

[City, Date]  

To the Management of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,512 DM to purchase a new car, which will significantly improve my mobility for work and daily responsibilities. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past five years, I have a stable income of 3,200 DM monthly, with 200 DM allocated to an existing savings account. My current checking account has been active for 24 months, and I have diligently repaid two previous loans with your bank—amounts of 2,000 DM and 1,500 DM—for laboratory equipment and professional development courses.  

I reside in my own apartment in Munich, having lived there for three years, and support my 8-year-old daughter. My employer confirms my position is secure, and I maintain a telephone line for professional communication. With 300 DM in savings and a history of punctual repayments, I am confident in managing this installment of 2 DM per month. This car will reduce commuting costs and ensure reliability for work-related travel.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I respectfully request a 3,512 DM loan to purchase a new vehicle, essential for my role as a certified electrician at Elektro-Service GmbH. With six years of employment and a monthly income of 2,800 DM, I have consistently saved 400 DM in a bonds account while maintaining a checking account for 24 months. My credit history includes two fully repaid loans (1,200 DM and 1,800 DM) for tools and safety equipment, reflecting my reliability.  

I reside in my own home in Dresden for three years and am the sole provider for my 6-year-old son. My job requires frequent client visits, and my current car’s repair costs exceed 1,000 DM—funds I cannot allocate. The new vehicle will ensure punctuality and professionalism. I have a registered foreign worker under my name, contributing to household income, and a telephone for business calls.  

I assure you of my commitment to repay the installment of 2 DM monthly. Thank you for your trust.  

Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Becker

**Letter 3**  
[Your Address]  
[City, Date]  

To the Loan Committee of [Bank Name],  

I am applying for a 3,512 DM car loan to support my role as an IT support specialist at TechNova AG. Employed there for four years, I earn 3,000 DM monthly and have saved 200 DM. My checking account, active for 24 months, reflects responsible financial habits, and I have repaid two prior loans (1,000 DM each) for software licenses.  

I own a residence in Berlin, where I’ve lived for three years, and care for my 10-year-old daughter. My current car, 15 years old, is unreliable for overnight shifts, which I handle twice monthly. A new vehicle will ensure job continuity and reduce repair expenses. My savings, combined with a stable income and no additional debtors, demonstrate my ability to manage the 2 DM installment.  

Thank you for reviewing my application. I am eager to discuss this further.  

Respectfully,  
Janine Fischer

**Letter 4**  
[Your Address]  
[City, Date]  

Dear Bank Officials,  

As a municipal clerk in Hamburg for five years, I seek a 3,512 DM loan to replace my aging car, critical for attending public meetings and fieldwork. My monthly salary of 2,700 DM includes 150 DM in savings, with a checking account held for 24 months. I have repaid two prior loans (900 DM and 1,100 DM) for office supplies, and my employer confirms my job stability.  

I reside in my own apartment for three years and am raising a 5-year-old son. My role requires frequent travel, and my current car’s breakdowns cost 800 DM monthly in repairs. A new vehicle will ensure efficiency and reduce stress. With a registered foreign worker contributing to household income and a telephone for official use, I am well-positioned to meet the 2 DM installment.  

Thank you for your consideration. I remain committed to timely repayments.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Schulz

**Letter 5**  
[Your Address]  
[City, Date]  

To Whom It May Concern,  

I am requesting a 3,512 DM loan to purchase a car for my work as a mechanical technician at AutoTech Solutions. Employed there for six years, I earn 2,900 DM monthly and maintain 500 DM in savings. My checking account, active for 24 months, and two repaid loans (1,300 DM and 1,600 DM) for workshop tools attest to my financial responsibility.  

I own a residence in Leipzig, where I’ve lived for three years, and support my 9-year-old daughter. My current car’s transmission failure has halted my ability to reach clients promptly. A new vehicle will restore productivity and avoid lost income. With no additional debtors and a stable income, I can comfortably manage the 2 DM installment.  

Thank you for your trust. I look forward to your approval.  

Yours truly,  
Andreas Weber
