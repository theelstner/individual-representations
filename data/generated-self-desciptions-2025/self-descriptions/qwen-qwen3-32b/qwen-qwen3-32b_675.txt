Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me list them out to make sure I don't miss anything. The person is a foreign worker, 24 years old, married with one dependent, living in their own housing, and has been in their current residence for 2 years. They have no checking account, but a savings account with 500-1000 DM. They have an existing credit at this bank, and another credit elsewhere. Their job is as a skilled employee or official, with employment duration between 1-4 years. The loan purpose is a new car, amount 2080 DM. Installment rate is 1, and they have no other installment plans or debtors/guarantors. They don't have a telephone.

I need to create five different people with these attributes. Let me think of different job roles first. The profile says "skilled employee / official". So maybe I can have a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a nurse, an IT technician, and a teacher. Each with specific details.

For each person, I need to explain why they're applying for the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They all need to have a savings account between 500-1000 DM. Let me assign different amounts within that range. Also, their employment duration is between 1-4 years, so maybe 2 years, 3 years, etc. Since they're foreign workers, perhaps from different countries? Maybe India, Philippines, Nigeria, Vietnam, and Bangladesh.

Let me start with the first person. Let's say a scientific research assistant from India, working at a university. He has been employed for 2 years, has 700 DM in savings. He needs a car to commute because his lab is far. He's married with a child. He mentions his stable job and savings as trustworthiness.

Second person: a mechanic from the Philippines, employed for 3 years. His savings are 600 DM. Needs a car for work (delivering repairs) and family. He emphasizes his steady income and existing credit management.

Third: a nurse from Nigeria, 2.5 years in job, 800 DM savings. Needs a car for night shifts and family. Highlights her stable employment and responsible financial habits.

Fourth: IT technician from Vietnam, 1.5 years employed, 900 DM savings. Needs a car for client visits. Mentions his technical skills and savings as proof of reliability.

Fifth: a teacher's assistant from Bangladesh, 3 years in job, 550 DM savings. Needs a car for school duties and family. Points to her dedication and existing credit responsibility.

Now, I need to make sure each letter is concise, includes all required elements, and is unique. Each should have specific job titles, exact employment duration (e.g., 8 years is given in the example, but the profile says 1-4 years, so adjust accordingly). Also, mention the savings amount, purpose of the loan, and why they are trustworthy. Avoid generic terms, use specific instances. Make sure they don't have a checking account, but have a savings account. Also, mention that they have an existing credit at the bank, and another credit elsewhere. They have no telephone, so maybe they use a mobile phone? Wait, the profile says telephone: none. So perhaps they don't have a landline, but maybe they have a mobile? Not sure, but maybe just avoid mentioning telephone unless necessary.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, then the bank's address. Then the body explaining their situation. Make sure to end properly without any formatting.

Let me draft the first one:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2080 DM to purchase a new car. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Frankfurt for the past 2 years, I require reliable transportation to commute between my residence and the laboratory, which is 45 minutes away by public transport. My wife and I have one child, and we currently rely on shared rides, which are inconsistent with my 6 a.m. start times.

Though I do not currently maintain a checking account, I have a savings account with 700 DM accumulated from my monthly salary of 2400 DM. I am employed on a 2-year contract with the university and have a critical account with an existing credit of 1500 DM at another institution for household expenses. My stable income, combined with my 500 DM monthly savings contributions, demonstrates my ability to manage repayments responsibly. I am committed to repaying this loan in full and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my application further.

Sincerely,
[Name]

That's the first letter. Let me check if all attributes are covered: foreign worker (Indian), age 24, married with 1 dependent, own housing, 2 years employment, savings 700 DM, existing credit at another bank, purpose car, no checking account. Yes.

Second person: Mechanic from the Philippines, 3 years employed, 600 DM savings. Let's see:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I respectfully request a 2080 DM loan to purchase a reliable vehicle for my work as an auto mechanic at Schmidt's Garage, where I've been employed for 3 years. My current motorcycle is no longer suitable for transporting repair parts to clients' homes, which is essential for our mobile service offerings. With my wife and young daughter depending on me for transportation, I need a car that can accommodate our family needs as well.

While I do not maintain a checking account, my 600 DM savings account reflects my disciplined approach to saving from my 2800 DM monthly salary. I currently manage a 1200 DM credit at this bank for tools and have another credit of 800 DM at a local cooperative. My stable employment, combined with my history of timely payments on existing credits, assures you of my reliability. I am prepared to provide any additional documentation needed to support my application.

Sincerely,
[Name]

Third: Nurse from Nigeria, 2.5 years employed, 800 DM savings.

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a 2080 DM loan to purchase a vehicle that will enable me to maintain my 24/7 availability as a nurse at St. Elisabeth Hospital. With night shifts and rotating schedules, public transportation is impractical for my family's needs. My husband and I have one child, and our current shared car is scheduled for retirement next month.

Though I do not hold a checking account, I have consistently saved 800 DM from my 3200 DM monthly income as a contract nurse. I have been employed at the hospital for 2.5 years and currently service a 900 DM credit here for medical certification courses. My additional credit of 1100 DM at a pharmacy chain is paid punctually each month. This loan would greatly enhance my professional reliability while ensuring family stability.

Sincerely,
[Name]

Fourth: IT technician from Vietnam, 1.5 years employed, 900 DM savings.

Dear Sir or Madam,

I write to request a 2080 DM loan for a vehicle to support my role as an IT technician at Tech Solutions GmbH. Having relocated from Hanoi 1.5 years ago, I require dependable transportation to visit clients across the region. My current public transit costs consume 15% of my monthly income, funds better allocated toward my wife and daughter's education.

While I do not maintain a checking account, my 900 DM savings account demonstrates my financial discipline from my 2600 DM salary. I currently manage a 750 DM credit here for my professional certification and have a 500 DM outstanding balance at a furniture store. My stable employment and growing savings prove my ability to meet repayment obligations. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this loan in person.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am requesting a 2080 DM loan to purchase a car that will improve my efficiency as a teacher's assistant at the Dortmund International School. With my 3-year contract requiring me to supervise field trips and transport materials, a personal vehicle is essential. My family of three currently shares one car, making this loan crucial for balancing work and family responsibilities.

Though I do not have a checking account, my 550 DM savings account reflects my commitment to financial responsibility from my 2200 DM monthly salary. I currently service a 600 DM credit here for professional development courses and have a 400 DM loan with a colleague for household appliances. My stable employment history and punctual payment record assure you of my trustworthiness. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

I need to check each letter for the required elements and ensure they are unique. Each has different job roles, employment durations, savings amounts, and specific reasons. They all mention no checking account, existing credits, savings, and their trustworthiness. The letters are concise, under a page each, and properly ended. I think this meets the user's request.
