Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile includes specific attributes like a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM, a 36-month duration, critical credit history with existing credits not at this bank, purpose for radio/television, loan amount 2337 DM, savings under 100 DM, employment for at least 7 years, single male, no other debtors, residence for 4 years, real estate, age 36, own housing, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe vary the job roles since the profile mentions "skilled employee / official." For example, a scientific research assistant, electrician, teacher, IT technician, and a mechanic. Each person can have different reasons for needing the loan, but all related to radio/television. Maybe purchasing equipment, upgrading home theater, starting a small media business, buying a TV for a family, or funding a community radio project.

I need to make sure each letter explains their financial situation, trustworthiness, and why they need the loan. They should mention their stable job, duration of employment, residence, existing property, and how they'll manage repayments with the installment rate of 4 DM. Also, address their critical credit history by showing they've managed other credits responsibly.

Let me start drafting each letter. For the first one, maybe a scientific research assistant applying for a home theater system to relax after work. He has a stable job, owns property, and wants to improve his living conditions. He mentions his existing credit but assures timely payments.

Second, an electrician wanting to buy a TV for his family. He's been in Germany for 8 years, has a steady income, and uses the TV for educational purposes for his child. He emphasizes his real estate ownership and commitment to repayments.

Third, a teacher planning to start a small community radio project. He needs equipment costing 2337 DM. He's been teaching for 7 years, has a dependent, and shows responsibility by managing his finances carefully.

Fourth, an IT technician upgrading his radio equipment for a hobby that he turns into a side income. He's been employed for 9 years, lives in his own home, and has a plan to repay the loan with his stable salary.

Fifth, a mechanic buying a TV for his household. He's a foreign worker, has been in the country for 7 years, owns property, and wants the TV to stay connected with his family back home. He mentions his punctual payment history despite past credit issues.

I need to ensure each letter is concise, includes specific numbers (like 8 years employment, 4 years residence), and addresses the critical credit history by showing responsibility. Also, avoid formatting and keep the language simple and direct.

Dear Loan Committee  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, 36, a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich. I have been employed in this role for 8 years and earn a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. I am applying for a 2,337 DM loan to purchase a television for my household, as my current device is nonfunctional and I rely on public broadcasts for news and educational content. Though my checking account balance is low due to recent medical expenses, I have consistently paid my existing credit (a car loan from a different bank) on time. I own a condominium valued at 150,000 DM and have resided at my current address for 4 years. My dependent daughter and I live in our own housing, and I am committed to repaying this loan through my steady income. I kindly request your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Mohamed

Dear Sir or Madam  

I am Karim Hassan, 36, an electrical engineer working at Siemens since 2016. My monthly salary is 3,100 DM, and I have maintained this job for 9 years. I seek a 2,337 DM loan to buy a television for my family, as we have no other means to access local news. My savings account holds 80 DM, but I have no debt除了 a small personal loan from a family member. I own a real estate property in Stuttgart and have lived at my current residence since 2020. While my credit history includes a past delay in repaying a friend’s loan, I have since prioritized financial discipline. My stable income and homeownership assure you of my ability to meet monthly installments. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Karim Hassan

To Whom It May Concern  

As a foreign IT technician named Rajesh Kumar, 36, I have worked at a Berlin software firm since 2018, earning 2,900 DM monthly. I apply for a 2,337 DM loan to purchase a radio and television set to stay informed about global tech trends and support my professional development. My savings are minimal due to recent investments in certification courses, but I have a strong employment record and own a shared apartment in Hamburg. I have resided at this address for 4 years and am the sole provider for my 6-year-old son. Though I have an outstanding credit from a previous employer’s relocation package, I have never missed a payment. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan responsibly.  

Yours faithfully,  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Bank Officials  

My name is Luis Alvarez, 36, a certified mechanic employed at a garage in Frankfurt since 2019. I request a 2,337 DM loan to replace our family’s broken television, which is essential for my daughter’s school broadcasts. My monthly income is 2,700 DM, and I have no other installment plans. I own a condominium and have lived in Germany for 8 years. While my credit history includes a delayed payment on a motorcycle loan (now fully repaid), I have maintained punctual payments for my current housing and this bank’s existing credit. My stable job and property ensure I can manage the 4 DM installment rate. Thank you for your understanding and support.  

Sincerely,  
Luis Alvarez
