Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the checking account has less than 200 DM, duration of 36 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back properly. The purpose is a used car, credit amount 6948 DM. Savings account is under 100 DM. Employment since 1-4 years, installment rate 2. Male, single, no debtors/guarantors, residence since 2 years, property is a car or other. Age 35, no other installment plans, housing is rent. One existing credit at the bank. Job in management, self-employed, or highly qualified employee. Dependents: 1, has a telephone, foreign worker registered under their name.

I need to create five different scenarios. Let me brainstorm different jobs from the profile's job category. The job is management/self-employed/highly qualified employee. Let me think of specific roles: maybe a project manager, a freelance graphic designer, a research scientist, a retail store manager, and an IT consultant. Each should have a unique situation but fit the profile.

For each letter, they need to explain why they need the loan (used car), their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Let me check the profile again to make sure I don't miss any details. Each person should have specific attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use a specific job title. The duration of employment is 1-4 years, so maybe 2 years for one, 3 for another, etc. Age is 35, same for all? Or can they vary? The profile says age is 35, so all applicants should be 35. Wait, the profile says "Age:35"—so all five letters are from 35-year-olds? Hmm, maybe they can be slightly different, but the profile specifies age as 35, so perhaps they should all be 35. Let me check the original instruction again. The user says "Invent specific instances of all generic attributes from the profile." So for example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant." So for each letter, the job should be specific. Let me list possible jobs: management could be project manager, team leader; self-employed could be freelance photographer, consultant; highly qualified employee could be engineer, scientist, etc.

Also, each person has been employed between 1-4 years. Let me assign different durations: 2, 3, 1.5, 4, 2.5 years. The credit amount is 6948 DM, purpose is used car. Each letter needs to explain why they need the car. Maybe for work-related reasons, like visiting clients, commuting, business use, etc.

Financial situation: checking account is less than 200 DM, savings under 100 DM. They have an existing credit paid back duly. They have no other installment plans. They live in rented housing. They have a dependent (one child). They have a telephone, and are registered foreign workers.

Now, for each letter, I need to create a unique scenario. Let me outline each person:

1. Project Manager in IT, employed 3 years, needs a car to visit clients. Single father, stable income, existing loan for car already paid back.

2. Freelance Graphic Designer, self-employed for 2 years, needs reliable car for client meetings. Savings low but consistent income, existing credit paid on time.

3. Scientific Research Assistant with 4 years employment, requires vehicle for lab commutes and fieldwork. Has one dependent, good credit history.

Wait, but the employment duration is 1-4 years. The profile says "Present employment since:1 <= ... <4 years"—so less than 4, so 4 is excluded. So maybe 3.5 years max. Let me adjust. Maybe 3 years for one, 2.5 for another, etc.

Also, the existing credit at the bank is 1. Each person has one existing credit that they paid back. So in each letter, they mention that they have a current loan with the bank (maybe a smaller one) that they've been paying on time.

Let me start drafting each letter.

First person: Maybe a project manager in a tech company, employed for 3 years. He's single with one child. Needs a car for client visits. Has a savings account under 100 DM but has been paying his existing loan on time.

Second person: Self-employed, maybe a consultant, has been in business for 2 years. Needs a car for business travel. No other debts, good payment history.

Third person: A research scientist at a university, employed for 3 years. Needs a car for commuting and fieldwork. Has a stable job and has already repaid previous loans.

Fourth person: A retail store manager, employed for 1.5 years. Needs a car to manage multiple store locations. Reliable income, existing credit paid back.

Fifth person: IT consultant, freelance, 2.5 years in business. Needs a car for client site visits. Has a good track record with the bank.

Each letter should mention the purpose (used car), financial situation (checking account, savings), employment duration, existing credit history, and why they're trustworthy.

Make sure each has specific job titles and numbers. Also, check that they are all 35 years old, have one dependent, live in rented housing, have a phone, and are registered foreign workers.

Now, write each letter concisely, without formatting, and ensure they end properly. Let me start drafting each one, making sure to vary the specifics and avoid repetition.
