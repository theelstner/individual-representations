Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on a specific profile. First, I need to understand the profile provided. Let me break down the key attributes.

The profile includes details like a checking account balance under 0 DM, a 12-month duration, good credit history, purpose for furniture/equipment, credit amount 1289 DM, savings under 100 DM, employment for 1-4 years, single male, guarantor, residence for 1 month, property as building society savings or life insurance, age 21, no other installment plans, own housing, one existing credit at the bank, unskilled resident job, one dependent, no telephone, and foreign worker status.

Each letter needs to be from a different person. So, I should vary the specific instances of the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant," and specify numbers like "8 years" instead of ">=7 years." The letters must be concise, not cut off, and avoid formatting.

First, I need to create five distinct scenarios. Let me think of different purposes under furniture/equipment. Maybe a student needing a desk, a worker needing tools, someone upgrading home office equipment, a parent needing a crib, and a musician needing instruments. Each person will have different reasons but fit the profile.

Check the financial situation: each has a negative checking account, so they might mention recent expenses or emergencies. They all have a guarantor, so I should mention that. The employment duration is 1-4 years; perhaps jobs like factory worker, construction laborer, etc. Age 21, single, with one dependent—maybe a sibling or child they're supporting.

Need to ensure each letter explains why they need the loan, their ability to repay (despite low savings, they have a guarantor and existing credit paid back), and their trustworthiness. Also, mention the building society savings or life insurance as collateral.

Let me outline each letter:

1. Student needing a desk and chair for studies. Guarantor is a relative. Working part-time as a factory worker. Dependents: younger sibling.

2. Construction worker needing tools. Guarantor is a cousin. Lives with family, so housing is own. Savings in life insurance.

3. Home-based baker needing kitchen equipment. Guarantor is a friend. Recent move, only lived in residence for 1 month.

4. Caregiver needing a crib for a dependent. Guarantor is a sibling. Works in a nursing home.

5. Musician needing instruments for gigs. Guarantor is a bandmate. Works as a street performer.

Each letter should start with addressing the bank, state purpose, financial situation, repayment ability, guarantor, and a polite closing. Avoid formatting, keep paragraphs short.

Need to make sure all profile elements are addressed: existing credit paid back, negative checking account, low savings, employment duration, etc. Also, mention the specific numbers: 1289 DM, installment rate 4, etc.

Check for conciseness, proper endings, and that each letter is unique. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they don't repeat the same scenarios and cover different angles of the profile.

Dear Sir or Madam  

I am writing to request a loan of 1289 DM to purchase a workbench and tools for my role as a factory assembly technician. At 21 years old, I have worked at a manufacturing plant for 2.5 years and recently moved to own housing, though my checking account is currently overdrawn due to emergency repairs. I have a guarantor in my cousin, who is a stable employee at a logistics firm. While my savings are minimal (<100 DM), I have consistently repaid my existing bank credit for phone bills and maintain a building society savings agreement. With my monthly income of 1200 DM and a 4 DM installment rate, I am confident in repaying this loan. I kindly ask for your trust in my reliability.  

Sincerely  
Lars Müller

Dear Bank Manager  

I need 1289 DM to buy a used laptop and office chair for my remote customer service job. I have worked at a call center for 18 months and support my younger sister, who lives with me. My checking account is temporarily negative due to a recent medical expense, but I have never defaulted on payments for my existing credit. My guarantor, my uncle, is a construction foreman with 10 years of experience. Though I have little savings, my monthly salary of 1150 DM and a life insurance policy ensure stability. I am committed to repaying this loan in full and appreciate your consideration.  

Yours faithfully  
Anil Kumar

Dear Sir or Madam  

I am applying for a loan to furnish my new home office as a freelance graphic designer. My current setup is inadequate, and I need a desk and ergonomic chair to work efficiently. I have been employed at a printing company for 3 years and recently moved to my own apartment. My checking account is overdrawn due to upfront rent, but I have a guarantor in my roommate, a teacher with a stable income. I have repaid all previous credits and hold a building society savings agreement. With my 1000 DM monthly earnings and a 4 DM installment plan, I am capable of fulfilling repayment. Thank you for your support.  

Respectfully

Dear Bank Officer  

I require 1289 DM to purchase a stroller and baby crib for my 6-month-old daughter, whom I care for full-time. My partner’s income as a mechanic covers our needs, but I need this equipment to attend a parenting course and improve my future employment prospects. My checking account is currently negative due to recent childbirth expenses, and my savings are low. My guarantor is my sister, a nurse with 5 years of experience. I have no other debts except my existing phone credit, which I repay monthly. With my partner’s stable income and our life insurance, I assure timely repayments. I am grateful for your understanding.  

Kind regards

Dear Sir or Madam  

I am requesting a loan to buy musical instruments for my street performance career. I have worked as a musician in public spaces for 2 years and need a new drum kit to secure paid gigs. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn after replacing my old drum set with a cheaper alternative. My guarantor is my bandmate, a part-time music teacher. I have a building society savings agreement and have always repaid my single existing credit for a portable amplifier. With my 900 DM monthly earnings from performances and a 4 DM installment rate, I am confident in repayment. Thank you for your confidence in my artistic journey.  

Sincerely  
Tomasz Wójcik
