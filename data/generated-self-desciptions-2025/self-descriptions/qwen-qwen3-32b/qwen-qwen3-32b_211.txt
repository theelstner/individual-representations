Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me list them out:

- No checking account
- Duration in months: 12 (so 1 year)
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly till now
- Purpose: used car
- Credit amount: 1413 DM
- Savings account/bonds: >=1000 DM
- Present employment since: 4 to 7 years (so between 4 and 7, not including 7)
- Installment rate: 3 (maybe 3%? Or 3 DM? The unit isn't clear, but maybe it's a percentage)
- Personal status: male, single
- Other debtors/guarantors: none
- Present residence since: 2 years
- Property: building society savings agreement or life insurance
- Age: 55
- Other installment plans: none
- Housing: own
- Number of existing credits at this bank: 1
- Job: skilled employee or official
- Dependents: 1
- Telephone: none
- Foreign worker: no

Each letter needs to be from a different person. So I need to vary the specific instances of the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs like "scientific research assistant," "electrician," etc. Also, durations should be specific numbers within the given ranges.

Let me think about how to vary each letter. Each person should have a different job, maybe different savings amounts, different employment duration (between 4-7 years), different residence details, and maybe different reasons for needing the car (e.g., commuting to work, medical reasons, etc.).

Also, each letter must explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their savings, existing credit history, employment stability, and other factors.

Let me start drafting each letter one by one.

First person: Maybe a 55-year-old electrician, employed for 5 years, living in the same residence for 2 years, has a building society savings agreement. Needs a car for commuting to work. Savings of 1500 DM. Existing credit paid back (maybe a previous loan for tools?).

Second person: Maybe a 55-year-old teacher or official, employed for 6 years, savings of 1200 DM. Needs a car for transporting dependents, perhaps for school runs. Existing credit for a previous car loan.

Third person: A 55-year-old mechanic, employed for 4 years, savings of 1000 DM. Needs a car for work-related travel. Maybe he's self-employed? Wait, the job is skilled employee or official, so maybe he's a salaried employee. Let me check the profile again. The job is "skilled employee / official," so perhaps a certified tradesperson. Maybe a mechanic, employed for 5 years.

Fourth person: A 55-year-old administrative officer, employed for 6 years, savings of 2000 DM. Needs a car for medical appointments (since he has dependents, maybe a dependent with health issues).

Fifth person: A 55-year-old IT technician, employed for 4 years, savings of 1300 DM. Needs a reliable car for daily commute and to visit clients.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then a subject line. Then the body explaining their situation. Need to make sure they mention the existing credit paid back, savings, employment duration, residence, and why they need the car. Also, since they have no checking account, maybe mention that they manage finances through savings account or other means. Also, no telephone, so maybe they prefer written communication or use work contacts.

Need to ensure that each letter is unique in specifics but fits the profile. Also, each should end properly with a closing.

Let me check the example given in the user's instruction. They mentioned "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee," so I need to be specific with job titles. Also, durations: for employment, use numbers between 4-7 years (so 4,5,6), and residence is 2 years. The credit amount is fixed at 1413 DM. The installment rate is 3, but not sure if that's a percentage or DM. Maybe it's 3% of the credit amount? Or 3 DM per month? Since the credit amount is 1413, maybe the installment is 3% which would be about 42 DM per month. But the user didn't specify, so maybe just mention the installment rate as given without calculation.

Also, each person has one existing credit at the bank, which they've paid back. So in each letter, mention that they have an existing credit with the bank that they've repaid responsibly.

Now, let me draft each letter step by step.

First letter:

Name: Maybe Hans Müller

Job: Electrician, employed for 5 years

Savings: 1500 DM

Purpose: Car for commuting to work, which is 30 km away. Current car is old and unreliable.

Mentions existing credit (maybe a tool loan) paid back.

Second letter:

Name: Thomas Becker

Job: Municipal Administrative Officer, employed for 6 years

Savings: 1200 DM

Purpose: Car to help with dependent (child) attending school far away.

Third letter:

Name: Stefan Fischer

Job: Auto Mechanic, employed for 4 years

Savings: 1000 DM

Purpose: Car needed for work as he needs to visit clients.

Fourth letter:

Name: Klaus Weber

Job: IT Support Specialist, employed for 5 years

Savings: 1300 DM

Purpose: Car for health reasons (dependent requires regular medical appointments).

Fifth letter:

Name: Rolf Schmidt

Job: Public Sector Official, employed for 6 years

Savings: 2000 DM

Purpose: Car to replace current one that's breaking down, important for job as he travels between sites.

Each letter should include:

- Introduction stating the loan application.

- Financial situation: savings, employment, residence, existing credit.

- Purpose of the loan.

- Trustworthiness: repayment history, stable job, etc.

- Closing with thanks and contact info (even though no telephone, maybe provide address).

Now, writing each letter with these points, keeping them concise and specific.
