Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the provided profile. First, I need to parse the profile to understand the specific attributes.

The profile includes details like no checking account, 24 months duration, credit history with existing credits paid back, purpose is a new car, credit amount 1474 DM, savings between 100-500 DM, employment less than a year, installment rate 4, male married/widowed, no debtors, residence since 3 years, real estate property, age 33, own housing, one dependent, telephone yes, foreign worker registered.

Each letter must be unique, so I need to vary the scenarios while sticking to the profile. Let me brainstorm different angles. Maybe different job roles, reasons for needing the car, and unique personal touches. For example, one could be a mechanic needing a van for work, another a teacher needing a car for commuting, etc. Each should explain their financial situation, trustworthiness, and why they need the loan.

Need to ensure each letter includes specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "automotive mechanic," "civil servant," etc. Also, mention the savings amount within the range, maybe 200 DM, 300 DM, etc. Each person's employment duration is less than a year, so maybe they recently changed jobs. They have real estate, so perhaps a house they own. They have one dependent, maybe a child or parent.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, starts with the applicant's name and address, date, bank details, and proper closing. Avoid formatting, just plain text. Also, check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter without repetition. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are distinct yet adhere to the profile.

Dear [Bank Name],  
My name is Thomas Reinhardt, and I am a 33-year-old automotive mechanic employed at Munich Auto Repairs. I have been in this role for 8 years and recently moved to Nuremberg, where I’ve resided for the past 3 years in my own apartment. I currently own a 12-year-old car that is unreliable for my daily 45-minute commute and work-related client visits. I need a new vehicle to maintain my job performance and reduce repair costs. I have a savings account with 320 DM and a history of repaying a prior loan for tools. Though I do not yet have a checking account, I am registered as a foreign worker and have a stable income. My wife and I have one child, and I am committed to meeting installment payments. I respectfully request approval for this loan.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Reinhardt
