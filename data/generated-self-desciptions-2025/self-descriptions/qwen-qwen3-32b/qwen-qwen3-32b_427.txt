Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account with less than 200 DM, duration of 18 months. Credit history is good, existing credits paid back. Purpose is a used car, loan amount 2779 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Employment since 1-4 years. The person is a male, married or widowed, no other debtors, residence since 3 years, property is a car or other. Age 21, no other installment plans, housing is rent, one existing credit at the bank, job is skilled employee or official, one dependent, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker.

I need to create five different people. Let me think of different skilled jobs. Maybe a mechanic, a lab assistant, a carpenter, a warehouse supervisor, and a cook. Each should have unique details. For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy.

Starting with the first person: Let's say a scientific research assistant. He's been working for 8 years, married with a child. He needs a car for commuting. He has a good credit history, currently has a small checking account because he's saving up for the car. His savings are low because he's been paying off previous loans. He's lived in his residence for 3 years. He works at a university lab. His wife helps with income. They have a rental house. He's a foreign worker registered.

Second person: Maybe a mechanic. He's been employed for 2 years, married, one child. Needs a van for his job. Has a small checking account because he's been spending on parts. Paid previous loans. Lives in the same place for 3 years. Works at a garage. His wife works part-time. They rent. He's a foreign worker.

Third: A carpenter. Employed for 3 years, married, one kid. Needs a truck for deliveries. Has a small account because he's saving for tools. Good credit history. Lives in the same residence. Works at a construction company. Wife works as a cleaner. They rent. Foreign worker.

Fourth: Warehouse supervisor. 4 years at the job, married, one dependent. Needs a car for longer hours. Checking account is low because of monthly expenses. Paid previous loans. Lives there 3 years. Works at a logistics company. Wife is a teacher. Renting. Foreign worker.

Fifth: Cook in a restaurant. Employed for 1 year, married, child. Needs a car to commute longer distance. Savings low because of family expenses. Good credit. Residence since 3 years. Works at a café. Wife is a seamstress. Rent. Foreign worker.

Each letter should start with sender's info, date, bank address, salutation, body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and a polite closing. Need to make sure each has specific numbers and roles. Avoid generic terms. Check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter. Make sure the letters are concise and not cut off. Each should have a proper ending with the sender's name and signature.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring the details fit the profile and vary per person. Also, check that the loan amount is 2779 DM, purpose is used car, and other attributes like age 21, etc. Make sure each person's job is a skilled employee or official. Also, mention the existing credit at the bank, which they've paid back. Each has a telephone, no other debts, etc.

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am applying for a loan of 2,779 DM to purchase a used car, which is essential for my daily commute to the university laboratory where I work as a scientific research assistant. At 21 years old, I have been employed for 8 years, though I recently transitioned to this role after completing my studies. My current checking account holds 150 DM, and my savings are minimal due to prior student loans, which I repaid in full. My wife and I have one child and reside in our rental apartment, where we have lived for three years. I already hold a small credit with your bank for laboratory equipment, which I am repaying on time. A reliable vehicle will reduce my transportation costs and ensure punctuality. I kindly request your trust in my ability to manage this loan responsibly.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Samir

Dear Loan Committee,  

As a certified mechanic at Lopez Auto Repairs, I seek a 2,779 DM loan to buy a used van to transport tools and parts efficiently. I have worked here for 2 years and maintain a checking account of 120 DM. My wife and I, who have one daughter, have lived in our rented home for three years. I previously borrowed from your bank to repair my car, which I paid back without issue. My savings are limited as I prioritize covering my child’s school fees. This van will increase my productivity and income. I assure you of my commitment to repaying this loan promptly.  

Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendez

I kindly ask for your approval to secure this loan, which will streamline my work and improve our family’s stability.
