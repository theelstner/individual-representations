Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the points.

First, the profile details are:

- No checking account
- Duration in months: 39 (so about 3 years)
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly till now
- Purpose: used car
- Credit amount: 2569 DM
- Savings account/bonds: between 500-1000 DM
- Present employment since: 1-4 years (so maybe 2 years for one, 3 for another, etc.)
- Installment rate: 4 (maybe 4% or 4 DM? Probably 4% as it's a rate)
- Personal status: single male
- No other debtors/guarantors
- Present residence since: 4 years
- Property: car or other
- Age: 24
- No other installment plans
- Housing: own
- Number of existing credits at this bank: 1
- Job: skilled employee or official (like scientific research assistant, electrician, etc.)
- Dependents: 1
- No telephone
- Foreign worker: yes

Each letter needs to be from a different person, so I need to vary the job roles, maybe their specific situations, and how they explain their trustworthiness. Let me think of different jobs that fit "skilled employee / official". Examples could be electrician, mechanic, scientific research assistant, IT technician, nurse, etc.

Also, each person should explain why they need the car. Maybe for work commute, to start a small business, for family reasons, etc. Their financial situation should mention their savings, current employment, residence duration, and existing credit history.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, doesn't use formatting, and ends properly. Let me outline each person:

1. Electrician: Maybe he needs a reliable car for job site visits. He has been employed for 2 years, has a savings account, and has a good credit history.

2. Scientific Research Assistant: Needs a car for commuting to a lab, has been working there for 3 years, has some savings.

3. IT Technician: Needs a vehicle to reach client locations, employed for 1 year, but has stable income and savings.

Wait, the employment duration is between 1-4 years. The profile says "Present employment since:1 <= ... < 4 years". So each person's employment duration should be in that range. Let me assign different durations: 2, 3, 1, 2.5, 3.5 years, etc. But since the user wants specific instances, maybe use whole numbers. Let me check the example given in the problem: "8 years" instead of ">=7 years". So for each letter, I need to pick a specific number within the given ranges.

Also, the age is fixed at 24, so all applicants are 24. They are foreign workers, single, with one dependent. Housing is own, so they own their home. Savings between 500-1000 DM. No telephone, so they don't have a phone listed. 

For each letter, they need to explain why they need the loan (used car), their financial situation (current job, savings, residence duration, existing credit paid back), and why they're trustworthy (reliable payments, stable job, etc.).

Let me start drafting each letter with different jobs and specific details.

First person: Electrician, employed for 2 years, 24 years old, foreign worker, single with one dependent. He has been in residence for 4 years, has savings of 600 DM, existing credit paid back. Needs a car to reach job sites.

Second: Maybe a mechanic, employed for 3 years. Needs a car for work. Savings 800 DM. 

Third: IT technician, employed 1 year. Maybe he has a dependent, needs a car for work commute.

Fourth: Nurse, employed for 3 years, needs a car for shifts and family needs.

Fifth: Maybe a teacher's assistant, employed for 2 years, needs a car for commuting and dependents.

Wait, the job is "skilled employee / official". Let me check the original profile again. The job is "skilled employee / official". So possible jobs could be electrician, mechanic, IT technician, nurse, teacher's assistant, etc. 

Each letter should have unique job roles. Let me assign:

1. Electrician
2. Scientific Research Assistant
3. IT Technician
4. Nurse
5. Automotive Mechanic

Now, each with different employment durations (within 1-4 years), and different reasons for needing the car. Also, mention their savings, residence duration (4 years), existing credit history, etc.

Also, they don't have a checking account, but have a savings account/bonds between 500-1000 DM. So in their letters, they can mention their savings as a sign of financial responsibility.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, then the bank's address. But since the user didn't specify including addresses, maybe just start with the salutation. Wait, the user says "write the letters" but didn't specify format. However, they said not to use any formatting, so probably just the body of the letter. Wait, looking at the example response, the user provided an example where the letters start with "Dear Sir or Madam," and then the body. So I should follow that.

Each letter should have:

- Introduction: Purpose of the letter (applying for a loan)
- Reason for the loan (used car)
- Financial situation: employment duration, job role, savings, residence, existing credit
- Trustworthiness: reliable payments, stable job, savings, etc.
- Conclusion: Request for approval and thanks

Now, let me draft each one, making sure each has unique details. Let's start with the first one.

First letter: Electrician, 24, foreign worker, single, 1 dependent, employed for 2 years, savings 600 DM, residence since 4 years, existing credit paid back.

Second letter: Scientific research assistant, maybe employed for 3 years, savings 900 DM, needs car for commuting to university or lab.

Third: IT technician, employed for 1 year, but maybe his job is contract-based but stable, savings 700 DM.

Fourth: Nurse, employed 3 years, savings 550 DM, needs car for night shifts and family.

Fifth: Automotive mechanic, employed 4 years (wait, the profile says present employment since 1 <= ... <4 years. So up to 4 years, but not including 4. So maximum 3.9 years. So maybe 3 years for someone. Let me adjust. Let me pick employment durations as 2, 3, 1, 2.5, 3.5 years. But since the user wants specific instances, maybe use whole numbers. So 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 years.

Let me proceed.

Now, each letter should be short and concise. Let me check the example the user provided in their initial instruction. They mentioned "Do not cut off the letter - be sure to write a proper ending!" So each letter should have a closing like "Sincerely," followed by the name.

Also, the user wants each letter to be from a different person, so different names. Let me assign names accordingly. Maybe use common names in the context of their jobs. For example:

1. Carlos Mendoza (foreign worker, electrician)
2. Rajesh Patel (scientific research assistant)
3. Yuki Tanaka (IT technician)
4. Amina Diallo (nurse)
5. Miguel Ortega (automotive mechanic)

Now, drafting each letter with these names and roles.

Let me start with the first one.

Carlos is a 24-year-old electrician, employed for 2 years, savings 600 DM. He needs a used car for work. He has been living in his own home for 4 years, has a good credit history. He mentions his savings and responsibility.

Second letter: Rajesh, scientific research assistant for 3 years, needs a car to commute. Savings 900 DM. He's a foreign worker, single with a dependent.

Third: Yuki, IT technician employed for 1 year. Maybe his job is stable, and he needs a car for client visits. Savings 700 DM.

Fourth: Amina, nurse employed for 3 years. Needs a car for her shifts and to care for her dependent. Savings 550 DM.

Fifth: Miguel, automotive mechanic employed for 3 years. Needs a reliable car for his job. Savings 800 DM.

Each letter should mention their specific employment duration, savings amount, and reason for the loan.

Now, ensuring that each letter includes all required elements from the profile and that the details are specific. Also, they all have no checking account, but have savings accounts. Also, they are foreign workers, own their homes, no telephone, etc.

Let me write each letter step by step, making sure they are concise and include all necessary points.
