Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on a specific profile. First, I need to understand the profile given. Let me break down the profile attributes.

The profile includes details like a checking account with less than 0 DM, duration of 21 months, credit history of paying back credits at the bank, purpose is a new car, credit amount 1647, no savings account. Employment duration between 1-4 years, installment rate 4, male single, no other debtors, residence since 2 years, property as building society savings or life insurance, age 40, no other installment plans, own housing, 2 dependents, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

So each letter needs to be from a different person with these specifics. The user wants specific instances instead of generic terms. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use "scientific research assistant." Also, durations should be specific like "8 years" instead of ">=7 years."

First, I need to create five distinct personas. Each should have a unique job, maybe different countries of origin since they're foreign workers. Let me think of different jobs that fall under "unskilled - resident." Maybe construction worker, warehouse operative, janitor, delivery helper, and something else like a farm worker.

Each letter must explain why they need the loan (car for commuting, maybe work-related reasons), their financial situation (current job, duration, existing credits paid back), and why they're trustworthy (stable job, residence, dependents, etc.).

I need to make sure each letter is concise, not too long, and properly ends. Also, avoid any formatting. Let me start drafting each one step by step, ensuring all profile points are addressed with specific examples.

First person: Let's pick a construction laborer from Mexico, working in Germany for 3 years. He needs a car to commute longer distances. Mention his two dependents, own housing, existing credits paid, and his residence duration. Emphasize punctual payments and responsibility.

Second: Maybe a warehouse operative from Poland, employed 2.5 years. Needs a car for night shifts. Highlight his punctuality, savings agreement, and supporting family. Mention no telephone as per profile.

Third: A janitor from Portugal, working 1.5 years. Car for reliable transportation to maintain job. Mention his life insurance as property, dependents, and timely repayments.

Fourth: Delivery helper from Romania, 3 years in job. Car needed for efficiency, supporting parents. Emphasize stability in residence and employment.

Fifth: Farm worker from Morocco, 2 years employed. Car for commuting and work tools. Highlight his savings agreement and responsibility towards family.

Each letter should start with sender's info, date, bank address, subject, then body explaining purpose, financial status, trustworthiness, and a polite closing. Need to make sure all profile elements are covered without being repetitive. Check for specific numbers: 21 months checking account, 2 years residence, 40 years old, 4% installment rate, 2 existing credits, etc.

Also, ensure that each person's job is specific and fits the "unskilled - resident" category. Avoid using the same reasons for the loan; vary the purposes slightly even though they're all cars. Maybe commuting, work requirements, reliability, efficiency, etc.

Double-check that each letter doesn't cut off and has a proper ending. No markdown, just plain text with line breaks. Make sure the foreign worker aspect is mentioned in each, maybe different countries. Also, mention the existing credits paid back at the bank, savings agreement or life insurance as property, own housing, dependents, no other debts, etc.

Alright, let me draft each one now, keeping them concise and hitting all the points.

I am writing to request a loan of 1,647 DM to purchase a reliable vehicle for my daily commute. As a construction laborer employed at a site in [City] for the past 3 years, I require a car to manage the 45-minute drive to my workplace, especially as my shift hours often begin before public transport operates.  

I have maintained a checking account with your bank for 21 months, though it currently holds a minor overdraft due to recent unexpected repairs on my current vehicle. I have consistently repaid two previous loans from this bank for tools and safety equipment, demonstrating my commitment to fulfilling financial obligations. I reside in my own apartment in [Neighborhood] and have lived there for 2 years. My income, though modest, allows me to support my two children, and I have no other debts beyond this application. My employer has confirmed my stable position, and I am committed to making monthly installments of 4% without difficulty.  

As a foreign worker from Mexico, I value the trust extended to me in this country and aim to repay this loan with the same responsibility that has defined my work ethic.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

I have repaid two prior loans for work-related equipment at this bank and have no other outstanding debts. I have lived at my current residence in [City] for 2 years and own a modest home. Supporting my two young children as a single father requires financial discipline, which I have practiced by avoiding unnecessary expenses.

I seek a loan of 1,647 DM to replace my aging motorcycle with a vehicle suitable for my job as a janitor at [School/Office Name]. My current mode of transport is unreliable during winter, and a car would ensure I arrive on time to clean facilities for 80 students and staff.

While my checking account is currently overdrawn due to a family emergency, I have a building society savings agreement valued at 2,500 DM that I can liquidate if needed. I have repaid two prior loans for cleaning supplies at this bank and have no other debts. I reside in my own apartment, which I’ve occupied for 2 years, and I support my mother and younger brother, who live with me.  

As someone who prioritizes stability, I assure you that my income and existing financial discipline will allow me to meet the 4% monthly payment. I am committed to repaying this loan in full.  

Respectfully,
