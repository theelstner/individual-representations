Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me list them out:

- No checking account, has been with the bank for 5 months.
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly till now.
- Purpose: business.
- Credit amount: 3448 DM.
- Savings account/bonds: less than 100 DM.
- Present employment since 4 to 7 years (so maybe 5 years for one, 6 for another, etc.).
- Installment rate: 1 (maybe monthly payment of 1 DM? Not sure, but the user says to invent specific instances, so maybe just mention a specific rate).
- Male, single.
- No other debtors or guarantors.
- Present residence since 4 years.
- Property: real estate.
- Age: 74.
- No other installment plans.
- Housing: own.
- Number of existing credits at this bank: 1.
- Job: unskilled - resident.
- Dependents: 1.
- No telephone.
- Foreign worker: yes.

Wait, the age is 74? That seems high for someone with 4-7 years in a job. Maybe that's a typo? But the user says to use the given profile. Hmm. Maybe the person is an older foreign worker who has been in the country for 5 years, working an unskilled job, owns real estate, and is applying for a business loan. Also, has dependents (one person), no telephone, savings less than 100 DM. 

But how to make five different perspectives? Each person should have different specific instances. For example, different job roles (even though the profile says "unskilled - resident", maybe different unskilled jobs?), different business purposes (like a small shop, repair service, etc.), different employment durations (since present employment since 4-7 years, maybe 5, 6, etc.), residence since 4 years. Also, existing credit paid back, so maybe different types of previous loans.

Let me think of five different scenarios:

1. A 74-year-old foreign worker who has been in the country for 6 years, works as a janitor, owns a small property, wants to start a food stall. He's been employed at his current job for 5 years, has a dependent child, no phone, but has a good credit history.

2. Another could be a 74-year-old gardener, employed for 4 years, wants to buy equipment for landscaping business. Lives in own home, has paid back previous loan, needs 3448 DM.

3. Maybe a 74-year-old who works as a cleaner, has been employed for 7 years, wants to start a laundry service. Has a dependent, owns property, etc.

4. A 74-year-old foreign worker in construction, employed for 5 years, wants to buy materials for a repair business. 

5. Another could be a 74-year-old working as a helper in a workshop, employed for 6 years, wants to start a small repair shop.

Each letter needs to explain the loan purpose, their financial situation (including existing credit paid back, savings <100 DM, no checking account but has been with the bank 5 months), and why they're trustworthy (good credit history, own property, stable job, etc.).

Also, need to make sure each letter is concise, no formatting, proper ending. Let me start drafting each one with specific details.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Ahmed Hassan, a 74-year-old foreign worker residing in Germany for the past six years. I have been employed as a janitor at a local school for five years and own a small property in my hometown, which I rent out. Currently, I have one dependent, my daughter, whom I support financially. Although my savings are minimal (<100 DM), I have maintained a flawless credit history, having repaid my previous loan for tools at this bank. I now seek 3,448 DM to establish a mobile food stall, leveraging my cooking skills to generate stable income. My real estate ownership and consistent employment demonstrate my reliability. I assure timely repayments and am committed to contributing to the community through my business.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Hassan
