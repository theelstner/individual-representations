Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the requirements.

First, the profile includes details like existing checking account balance less than 200 DM, duration 12 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. Purpose is radio/television. Credit amount 1155 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Employment since at least 7 years. Married male with a guarantor, residence since 3 years, real estate, age 40, other installment plans with the bank, housing is own, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I need to vary the specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe use different jobs that fit "unskilled - resident." Let me think of different jobs. Maybe a cleaner, a maintenance worker, a warehouse helper, a security guard, and a janitor. Each with different employers and specific situations.

Also, the purpose is radio/television. Maybe each person has a slightly different reason: upgrading old equipment, starting a small business needing communication tools, educational purposes for their child, etc. But the main purpose is still radio/television as per the profile.

Each person should mention their financial situation: checking account balance, savings, employment duration, existing credits, guarantor. They need to explain why they're trustworthy—reliable payment history, stable job, guarantor support, real estate as collateral.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, not too long, and properly ends. Avoid formatting, just plain text. Let me start drafting each one step by step.

First person: Maybe a cleaner working at a hotel. Checking account 150 DM, savings 80 DM. Employed for 8 years. Married with one child. Guarantor is his brother. Wants to buy a TV for his family. Emphasize timely payments on existing credits, stable job, guarantor support.

Second person: Maintenance worker in a factory. Checking account 180 DM, savings 50 DM. Employed for 7 years. Guarantor is his sister. Needs a radio for his business (maybe he has a small repair shop and needs communication). Mention real estate ownership, existing credits with the bank.

Third person: Warehouse helper. Checking account 120 DM, savings 90 DM. Employed 9 years. Guarantor is a cousin. Wants to buy a TV for his child's education. Highlight dependents, stable residence, other installment plans with the bank.

Fourth person: Security guard. Checking account 190 DM, savings 70 DM. Employed 10 years. Guarantor is a friend. Needs a radio for work purposes (maybe to communicate on shifts). Mention foreign worker status, own housing.

Fifth person: Janitor in an office building. Checking account 160 DM, savings 60 DM. Employed 7.5 years. Guarantor is a colleague. Wants to upgrade old TV. Emphasize credit history, property ownership.

I need to ensure each letter has unique details but fits the profile. Avoid repetition in reasons for the loan. Each should have specific numbers, job titles, guarantors, etc. Also, make sure the financial figures are within the given ranges. Check that each letter explains why they're trustworthy: timely payments, guarantor, stable job, real estate.

Now, write each letter with these points in mind. Keep them short, start with address, date, salutation, body paragraphs explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and a polite closing.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
My name is Ahmed Khaled, a 40-year-old warehouse cleaner employed at the Hamburg Logistics Hub for 8 years. I am applying for a 1,155 DM loan to purchase a television for my family, as our current set is beyond repair. My checking account holds 150 DM, and my savings account has 80 DM, both maintained diligently. I have repaid two existing credits with your bank without delay, and my brother, a mechanic, serves as a guarantor. I own a small apartment in Stade, where I’ve lived for 3 years, and my stable income ensures timely repayments. As a foreign worker with a long-term contract, I value reliability and trust. I kindly request your support.  

Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Ahmed Khaled
