Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

First, the profile has several attributes. Let me list them out:

- Existing checking account: >= 200 DM with salary assignments for at least 1 year.
- Loan duration: 36 months.
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly till now.
- Purpose: radio/television.
- Credit amount: 4210 DM.
- Savings account/bonds: < 100 DM.
- Present employment since: 1 <= ... < 4 years.
- Installment rate: 4.
- Personal status: male, single.
- Other debtors/guarantors: none.
- Present residence since: 2 years.
- Property: car or other.
- Age: 26.
- Other installment plans: none.
- Housing: own.
- Number of existing credits at this bank: 1.
- Job: skilled employee / official.
- Dependents: 1.
- Telephone: none.
- Foreign worker: yes.

So, each letter must reflect these specifics. Let me break down the key points each letter should include:

1. Applicant's name, address, date.
2. Recipient's name/title.
3. Explanation of purpose (radio/television), but each with a unique angle.
4. Financial situation: current job, salary, savings, existing credit history.
5. Trustworthiness: punctual payments, stable employment, residence, etc.
6. Specific instances for generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "scientific research assistant" or "electrician."

I need to create five different personas. Let me brainstorm some jobs for skilled employees/officials. Maybe:

1. Electrician
2. Scientific research assistant
3. IT technician
4. Automotive mechanic
5. Public administration clerk

Each should have different specifics. Let me start with the first one.

First letter: Electrician. Let's say he's 26, foreign worker, employed for 2.5 years, living in own housing, has a car, one dependent (maybe a child?), existing credit paid back. Purpose: buy a TV for his family. He's single, no phone. Savings less than 100 DM. Installment rate 4 DM. Existing credit at the bank: maybe a previous loan for tools?

Second letter: Scientific research assistant. Maybe working in a lab, employed for 3 years, has a car, living in own housing. Purpose: buy a radio for his research (or for home use). Dependents: 1, maybe a parent?

Wait, the purpose is radio/television. Maybe each letter can have a slightly different angle. For example, one might need a TV for educational purposes, another for business, another for family entertainment, etc.

Third: IT technician. Maybe he needs a TV for online courses. Or maybe a radio for his small business.

Fourth: Automotive mechanic. Maybe a TV for his family, or to watch tutorials for his job.

Fifth: Public administration clerk. Maybe a TV for his child's educational programs.

Also, each should have different employment duration within 1-4 years. Let me assign different years:

- Electrician: 2.5 years
- Research assistant: 3 years
- IT technician: 1.5 years
- Mechanic: 2 years
- Clerk: 3.5 years

Each has a unique job title and specific details. Let me start drafting each letter with these in mind. Need to make sure they are concise, no formatting, proper ending. Each letter should mention the purpose, financial situation (current job, salary, existing credit history, savings, etc.), and trustworthiness. Also, include the foreign worker aspect, own housing, car, etc.

Let me check the example given in the user's instruction. They said "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee". So I need to make up specific job titles for each.

Also, the credit amount is 4210 DM, installment rate 4 DM. Wait, installment rate 4 DM per month? Or 4%? The original data says "Installment rate:4" but the unit isn't clear. Since the credit amount is 4210 DM over 36 months, maybe the monthly installment is around 117 DM (4210 / 36 ≈ 117). But the profile says installment rate:4. Maybe it's a code. The user might not need to explain the installment rate in the letter. Maybe just mention that the applicant can manage the payments.

Also, each applicant is a foreign worker, male, single, 26, living in own housing for 2 years, no telephone, one dependent.

Let me start writing the first letter.

First applicant: Electrician. Name: Ahmed Mohamed. Job: Electrician at a construction company. Employed for 2.5 years. Existing credit: a loan for tools paid back. Purpose: TV for family. Savings <100 DM. Trustworthy because of punctual payments, stable job, own house.

Second: Research assistant. Name: Li Wei. Job: Scientific research assistant at a university lab. Employed 3 years. Purpose: Radio for his research (maybe to stay updated with conferences or something). Or maybe TV for family. Let me think. Maybe he wants a TV for his family since he's single with a dependent (maybe a parent living with him). Trustworthy because of timely payments, stable job.

Third: IT technician. Name: Carlos Rivera. Job: IT technician at a tech firm. Employed 1.5 years. Purpose: TV for home entertainment. Trustworthiness: stable job, own house, previous credit paid.

Fourth: Automotive mechanic. Name: Rajesh Kumar. Job: Automotive mechanic at a repair shop. Employed 2 years. Purpose: Radio for his workshop (maybe to stay updated with traffic or news, or for business purposes). Or TV for family. Let's say he wants a TV for his child (dependent). But he's single. Maybe his dependent is a sibling.

Fifth: Public administration clerk. Name: Daniel Okoro. Job: Clerk in municipal office. Employed 3.5 years. Purpose: TV for his family. Trustworthiness: long-term employment, own house, etc.

Each letter should have a unique angle. Let me make sure each has specific job titles, employment duration, and purpose. Also, mention the existing credit paid back, savings, etc.

Now, write each letter with these details. Keep them short, no markdown, proper closing.

To the Loan Committee of [Bank Name],  

I am writing to request a loan of 4,210 DM to purchase a high-quality television for my household. As an electrician employed at GreenTech Construction for 2.5 years, I earn a stable monthly salary of 2,800 DM, which is directly deposited into my checking account held at your bank for over a year. I currently own a car and live in my own apartment, which I’ve resided in for two years.  

I have a history of responsibly repaying my previous loan for professional tools, which I settled in full over 18 months. Though my savings account holds less than 100 DM, my consistent income and punctual payment record—verified by my employer—allow me to manage monthly installments of 4 DM without difficulty. As a foreign worker committed to building roots here, I prioritize financial responsibility. This television will enhance my family’s access to educational programming for my 6-year-old daughter. I kindly request your approval and assurance of timely repayment.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Mohamed

Dear [Bank Name] Loan Committee,  

I seek a 4,210 DM loan to invest in a radio system for my research on renewable energy at the University of Berlin. Working as a scientific research assistant for three years, I receive 3,000 DM monthly, with automatic deposits into my account. I’ve lived in my own residence for two years and own a used car.  

My sole existing credit—a 2,000 DM grant for lab equipment—was repaid in full last year. While my savings are minimal (<100 DM), my steady income and disciplined budgeting ensure I can meet installment obligations. As a single foreign worker supporting my elderly mother, I value reliability and have no outstanding debts. This radio will aid in accessing international conferences, advancing my work. I assure you of my commitment to repay this loan promptly.  

Respectfully,  
Li Wei

I am applying for 4,210 DM to purchase a television to support my son’s education and our family’s needs. As an IT technician at TechNova Solutions for 1.5 years, I earn 2,900 DM monthly, with all payments processed through your bank.

Despite having less than 100 DM in savings, my stable employment and punctual repayment history demonstrate my reliability. I have no other debts and prioritize financial responsibility. This television will provide educational resources for my 8-year-old son, who lives with me. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment plan and appreciate your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,
