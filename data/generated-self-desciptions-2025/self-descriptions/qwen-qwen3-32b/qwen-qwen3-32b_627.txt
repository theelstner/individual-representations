Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile says the person is a foreign worker, single, 35 years old, has been in their current job for at least 7 years, and their job is a skilled employee or official. The purpose of the loan is for radio/television. The credit amount is 1979, and they don't have a checking account but have an existing credit they paid back. They have no savings account, own a car or other property, live in their own house, have no other installment plans, no debtors or guarantors, have been in their residence for 2 years, and have one dependent. Also, they don't have a telephone.

I need to invent specific instances for generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe a scientific research assistant, electrician, etc. Each letter should have a unique job and specific details. Let me think of five different jobs that fit the "skilled employee" category. Maybe:

1. Scientific Research Assistant
2. Electrician
3. IT Support Specialist
4. Automotive Mechanic
5. Construction Site Supervisor

Now, each letter needs to explain why they need the loan (radio/television), their financial situation (existing credit paid back, no savings, own home, car, etc.), and why they're trustworthy. They should also mention they don't have a checking account but have a stable job. Since they're foreign workers, maybe mention their legal status or work permit.

Let me start with the first one: Scientific Research Assistant. He's been in his job for 8 years. He wants to buy a TV to stay updated with international research. He has a car, lives in his own home, has a dependent (maybe a child). He has no savings account but has a good credit history. He's a foreign worker with a valid work permit.

Second, Electrician. He's been working for 7 years, needs a radio for his business (maybe for communication or staying updated with industry news). He has a car, own house. Trustworthy because he paid back previous loans. Maybe he's from another country but has been working there for years.

Third, IT Support Specialist. He needs a TV for professional development (online courses, webinars). He's been employed for 9 years, has a dependent. No savings account but has a stable income. As a foreign worker, maybe he mentions his intention to stay long-term.

Fourth, Automotive Mechanic. He wants a radio for his workshop to stay updated on automotive news. He's been in his job for 7 years, owns a car, has a dependent. Trustworthy because he has a good credit history.

Fifth, Construction Site Supervisor. Needs a TV to keep up with industry trends and safety regulations. Has been working for 10 years, owns a car, lives in own home. Foreign worker with valid documents.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then explain their purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness, and end with a polite request. Make sure each has unique specifics. Avoid formatting, keep them concise, and ensure proper endings.

Let me check if I missed any profile attributes: checking account status (no), duration in months (15, so about a year and a half), credit history (existing credits paid back), savings account (none), employment since >=7 years, installment rate 4 (maybe mention monthly payment?), present residence since 2 years, property (car), age 35, housing own, number of credits at bank 1. Maybe mention the residence duration and the existing credit at the bank.

Also, since they don't have a telephone, maybe note that they prefer written communication or mention it in the letter? Or maybe it's just background info not needed in the letter unless it's relevant. Probably not necessary to include unless it's part of their contact info. Since the letters don't have contact info, maybe just focus on the other aspects.

Make sure each letter has different reasons for needing the loan within the radio/TV category. For example, professional development, business needs, staying informed, etc.

Now, let me draft each letter step by step, ensuring all points are covered with specific details.

Dear Mr. Bank Manager,  

My name is Daniel Kim, and I am a scientific research assistant at the National Institute of Environmental Studies. I have worked there for 8 years and earn a stable monthly income of €2,800. I am writing to request a loan of €1,979 to purchase a high-quality television to stay updated with international scientific conferences and documentaries, which are critical for my research on climate change.  

I currently reside in my own apartment in the city center, a home I have lived in for the past 2 years. I own a used car and have no savings account but have consistently repaid my existing personal loan of €1,500 over the past 15 months. As a foreign worker with a valid residence permit, I have no dependents besides my 6-year-old son, whom I support fully. Though I do not have a checking account, my employer deposits my salary directly into a secured account, ensuring timely repayments.  

I kindly ask for your approval, confident in my ability to meet the monthly installment of €4. I am committed to maintaining my punctual payment history and appreciate your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Kim
