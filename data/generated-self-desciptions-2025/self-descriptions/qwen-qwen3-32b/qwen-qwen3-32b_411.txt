Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me note them down:

- Checking account: >=200 DM, salary assigned for at least 1 year
- Duration: 12 months
- Credit history: critical account, other credits exist (not at this bank)
- Purpose: new car
- Amount: 939 DM
- Savings: 500-1000 DM
- Employment since: 4-7 years
- Installment rate: 4
- Personal status: male, married/widowed
- No other debtors/guarantors
- Residence since: 2 years
- Property: real estate
- Age: 28
- No other installment plans
- Housing: own
- Existing credits at this bank: 3
- Job: skilled employee/official
- Dependents: 1
- Telephone: yes
- Foreign worker: registered under customer's name

Each letter needs to be from a different person. I need to invent specific instances for generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use a specific job like "scientific research assistant." Also, use specific numbers where ranges are given. Let me think of different professions and scenarios.

First person: Maybe a scientific research assistant. He's 28, married with one child. He has been working at a university for 6 years. He has a savings account with 700 DM. He needs a car for commuting. He has existing credits at this bank for a laptop, furniture, and a vacation. His current car is old and unreliable. He's a registered foreign worker.

Second person: Perhaps a civil servant, like a tax officer. He's 28, married, living in his own house. He has a savings bond of 600 DM. He needs a car for his job which requires visiting clients. He has three existing credits here for home improvements, a bicycle, and a course. His current car is too small for his family. He's a registered foreign worker.

Third person: Maybe an electrician. He's 28, widowed with one dependent. Lives in his own home. Savings of 800 DM. Needs a car for work and to transport equipment. Existing credits at the bank for tools, a motorcycle, and a refrigerator. His old car broke down. Registered foreign worker.

Fourth person: A teacher. 28, married, one child. Teaching at a school for 5 years. Savings of 900 DM. Needs a car for commuting and school activities. Existing credits for home appliances, a computer, and a concert ticket. Old car is unreliable. Registered foreign worker.

Fifth person: A public administration official. 28, married, one dependent. Works as a social services officer. Savings of 550 DM. Needs a car for home visits. Existing credits for a sofa, a washing machine, and a language course. Current car is too old. Registered foreign worker.

Now, each letter should explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They need to mention their stable job, existing savings, existing credits at the bank (showing reliability?), and other assets like real estate. Also, they have a telephone, which indicates stability.

I need to make sure each letter is concise, specific, and addresses the bank's concerns about repayment. Each person's profession and situation should be unique. Also, they all have been employed between 4-7 years, so I need to assign specific years within that range (like 6, 5, 4, etc.)

Check for each letter: mention checking account status, employment duration, savings amount, purpose of loan, existing credits, residence duration, property, etc.

Avoid generic terms. Use specific job titles, exact numbers where possible, and personal circumstances. Also, ensure that each letter has a proper closing without any formatting.

Let me start drafting each letter one by one, making sure they are distinct and cover all required points.

**Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am writing to apply for a loan of 939 DM to purchase a new car. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich for the past six years, I earn a stable monthly salary of 2,800 DM, with 1,200 DM automatically deposited into my checking account. My current vehicle, a 12-year-old Volkswagen, frequently breaks down, making it unsafe for my daily 45-minute commute. I have maintained a savings account with 700 DM for three years and already hold three small credits at this bank for laboratory equipment, a home office setup, and a vacation. My wife and I own a condominium in Garching, where we’ve lived for two years, and I am registered as a foreign worker with a valid employment contract. With my steady income and existing financial commitments, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan reliably. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Hoffmann  

**Letter 2**  
Dear Bank Manager,  
I respectfully request a 939 DM loan to replace my aging car, which is essential for my role as a tax officer at the Local Finance Office. I have worked there for five years, with a monthly salary of 3,100 DM, 1,500 DM of which is directly deposited into my checking account. My current car, a 1995 model, lacks the space needed for my wife and our toddler, and its repair costs are unsustainable. I hold a savings bond worth 600 DM and have three existing credits at this bank: a 200 DM loan for home insulation, a 300 DM loan for a bicycle, and a 400 DM loan for professional training. My family and I reside in our own apartment in Nuremberg, where we’ve lived since 2021. As a registered foreign worker with a secure job and real estate investments, I assure you of my commitment to timely repayments. I look forward to your approval.  

Best regards,  
Lars Müller  

**Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am applying for a 939 DM loan to purchase a reliable vehicle for my work as an electrician. Employed by Siemens since 2019, I receive a monthly salary of 2,900 DM, with 1,300 DM allocated to my checking account. My current car, a 1998 model, recently broke down during a job site visit, jeopardizing my ability to serve clients. I maintain a savings account with 800 DM and have three active credits at this bank—a 250 DM loan for tools, a 350 DM loan for a motorcycle, and a 400 DM loan for my son’s education. I own a townhouse in Stuttgart, where I’ve resided for two years, and am registered as a foreign worker with a permanent work permit. My stable income and property ownership underscore my financial responsibility. Thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Weber  

**Letter 4**  
Dear Bank Representative,  
I seek a 939 DM loan to acquire a new car for my role as a primary school teacher at the Berlin Central Academy. With a four-year tenure and a monthly salary of 2,600 DM, 1,250 DM is consistently deposited into my checking account. My 14-year-old car is no longer roadworthy, and I require reliable transportation to attend early-morning staff meetings and after-school events. I hold a savings account with 900 DM and have three existing credits at this bank: a 150 DM loan for classroom supplies, a 300 DM loan for a laptop, and a 450 DM loan for home repairs. My wife and I own a villa in Spandau, where we’ve lived since 2022. As a registered foreign worker with a secure career and family dependents, I am committed to fulfilling all repayment obligations. I appreciate your time and trust in my reliability.  

Kind regards,  
Andreas Fischer  

**Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am writing to request a 939 DM loan for a new car to support my work as a social services officer at the City of Hamburg. Employed for 4.5 years, I earn 3,000 DM monthly, with 1,400 DM automatically transferred to my checking account. My current vehicle, a 1997 model, is too old to handle frequent home visits, and its maintenance costs are excessive. I maintain a savings account with 550 DM and have three small credits at this bank—a 200 DM loan for a washing machine, a 300 DM loan for a language course, and a 450 DM loan for a sofa. I own a duplex in Altona, where I’ve resided for two years, and am registered as a foreign worker under a long-term employment contract. My steady income and property investment reflect my financial stability. Thank you for your understanding and support.  

Sincerely,  
Daniel Schmidt
