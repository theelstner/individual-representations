Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile.

The profile has several key points: no checking account, 15 months duration, good credit history, purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 2708 DM, savings less than 100 DM, present employment less than a year, installment rate 2, male single, no debtors/guarantors, residence since 3 years, property as building society savings or life insurance, age 27, other installment plans with bank, housing in own, 2 existing credits at the bank, job as unskilled resident, 1 dependent, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

First, I need to create five different people. Each should have specific jobs instead of "unskilled resident," maybe different furniture needs. Let me brainstorm some jobs that are unskilled but plausible. Maybe construction worker, warehouse helper, delivery cyclist, factory assembler, cleaning service worker. Each of these could need furniture for their home.

Each letter needs to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They have a good credit history, so I should mention that. Since they have existing credits paid back, maybe mention those. They have a building society savings agreement, so reference that as collateral. They have dependents, so maybe mention supporting family. Also, being a foreign worker, maybe they have stable employment despite being there less than a year.

Let me outline each person:

1. Construction Laborer: Needs a new bed and desk for his sister. Emphasize steady work, existing credits (maybe phone plan and car loan?), but wait, the profile says other installment plans: bank. Maybe he has a bank installment plan. Also, he's a foreign worker with a residence permit. His savings are low but has property.

2. Warehouse Worker: Applying for a dining set. Maybe he's living with his sister, so dependents. He's been in the country for a year, has a job, and has a life insurance policy as property.

3. Delivery Cyclist: Needs a kitchen set. He's self-employed? No, the job is unskilled. Maybe he works for a delivery service. He has a building society savings. Emphasize timely payments on existing credits.

4. Factory Assembler: Wants to buy a sofa. He's supporting his mother, so dependents. He's a foreign worker with a stable job. Has a savings agreement.

5. Cleaning Service Worker: Needs office furniture for home office. Maybe he's working in cleaning but needs a desk for remote work. Has two existing credits (phone and something else). Property as life insurance.

Each letter should start with their name, address, date, bank address. Then the body explaining purpose, financial situation, trustworthiness. Conclude with thanks and signature.

Make sure each has specific numbers: age 27, 3 years at residence, 15 months in current role (wait, duration in month:15, which is 1 year and 3 months, but present employment since <1 year. Wait, the profile says present employment since <1 year. So each person has been in their job less than a year. But duration in month is 15, which is 15 months. Maybe that's the duration at residence? Wait, the profile says:

Profile:
Duration in month:15 – probably duration of existing checking account? But the checking account status is no checking account. So maybe that's irrelevant. Maybe it's duration of current employment? But present employment since is <1 year. Hmm, conflicting? Maybe the "Duration in month:15" refers to something else. Maybe the duration of the existing credits? Not sure. Maybe I should follow the instructions to replace generic attributes with specific instances. The user says to invent specific instances for all generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee" use "scientific research assistant". In the profile, the job is "unskilled - resident". So I need to replace that with specific unskilled jobs.

So each person's job should be a specific unskilled job. Also, the purpose is furniture/equipment, so each letter can have different furniture needs. Each should mention their savings (less than 100 DM), existing credits (paid back), property (building society or life insurance), etc.

Let me start drafting each letter with these points. Make sure each is concise, not too long. Avoid formatting, just plain text with line breaks. Each letter should have a proper ending, not cut off.

First person: Maybe a construction worker from another country, needs furniture for his sister. He's been in the country less than a year but has a stable job. He has a life insurance policy as property. He's paying back existing credits. He has a dependent (sister). No telephone.

Second person: Warehouse helper, needs a dining set for his family. He's been in the country for 10 months, has a building society savings. Has two existing credits (maybe a mobile phone plan and another small loan). Lives in his own housing, has a dependent (younger brother). No phone.

Third: Delivery cyclist, needs kitchen equipment. Been working for a delivery service for 8 months. Has a savings agreement. Has dependents (mother). Emphasize timely payments.

Fourth: Factory worker, needs a sofa for his apartment. Has a life insurance. Has been in the country for 11 months. Two existing credits (phone and something else). Supports a dependent (younger cousin).

Fifth: Cleaning service worker, needs office furniture for working from home. Has a building society agreement. Has been employed less than a year but is reliable. Supports a dependent (younger sibling).

Each letter needs to mention why they are trustworthy: good credit history, existing credits paid back, property as collateral, stable employment despite <1 year, dependents showing responsibility.

I need to make sure each letter is unique in the specifics but hits all the required points. Also, check that each has the correct numbers: age 27, 3 years at residence, 2 existing credits, etc.

Let me write each one step by step, ensuring all the profile attributes are covered with specific instances.

To the Loan Committee,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,708 DM to purchase essential furniture for my sister, who lives with me. I am a construction laborer employed by UrbanBuild GmbH, a position I’ve held for 15 months. Though I’ve been working in Germany for less than a year, I have a stable income of 1,800 DM monthly and no intention of returning to my home country of Poland. My current residence in Munich has been my home for three years, and I own a life insurance policy valued at 1,200 DM, which I can offer as collateral.  

I have two existing credits with your bank—a mobile phone installment plan and a small tool loan—both of which I’ve repaid punctually. My savings account holds 80 DM, but I am committed to repaying this loan through my biweekly paycheck deductions. Supporting my 14-year-old sister adds motivation to maintain financial responsibility. I kindly request your approval, confident in my ability to meet monthly installments of 2 DM.  

Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 2,708 DM loan to furnish a dining set for my growing family. As a warehouse helper at LogiStar since September 2023, I earn 1,650 DM monthly and have no intention of leaving my stable position. I’ve resided in Hamburg for three years and own a building society savings agreement worth 900 DM. Though my savings account holds only 50 DM, my credit history reflects reliability—two prior loans for work boots and a bicycle were repaid in full.  

I am a 27-year-old single father supporting my 5-year-old son, which reinforces my commitment to timely payments. My housing is fully owned by my landlord, but I aim to create a dignified home environment. I currently manage a bank installment plan for utility bills and have no outstanding debts.  

I assure you of my dedication to repaying this loan. Please consider my application.  

Respectfully,  
[Your Name]

To Whom It May Concern,  

I am applying for a loan to purchase kitchen equipment, as my current setup is insufficient for my family of two. I work as a delivery cyclist for QuickDrop, a job I’ve held for 10 months, earning 1,400 DM monthly. I have lived at my current Berlin address for three years and maintain a life insurance policy valued at 1,500 DM.  

Though I have no checking account, I have consistently repaid my two existing credits—a 500 DM tool loan and a mobile phone plan—with your bank. My savings amount to 30 DM, but my disciplined budgeting ensures I can manage installments. As a foreign worker from Romania, I prioritize financial stability to support my elderly mother, who relies on me for healthcare expenses.  

I am confident in my ability to repay 2 DM monthly. Thank you for your trust.  

Yours faithfully,  
[Your Name]

Dear Loan Committee,  

I request a 2,708 DM loan to replace my worn-out sofa, which is essential for my home office as a factory assembler at TechForm. I’ve worked there for 8 months, earning 1,700 DM monthly, and plan to continue indefinitely. I’ve resided in Frankfurt for three years and own a building society savings agreement worth 700 DM.  

My credit history includes a fully repaid 300 DM loan for work gloves and a 400 DM mobile phone installment plan. My savings account holds 20 DM, but I have no other debts. As a single man supporting my younger cousin, who lives with me and studies part-time, I am motivated to maintain financial discipline.  

I assure you of my reliability and commitment to repaying this loan. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

To the Bank’s Loan Department,  

I am applying for a loan to purchase a desk and chair for my remote cleaning service administrative work. I work as a janitor at CleanPro, a role I’ve held for 11 months, with a monthly income of 1,550 DM. I have lived in Stuttgart for three years and possess a life insurance policy valued at 1,000 DM.  

I currently manage two small credits with your bank—a 250 DM utility loan and a 150 DM mobile phone plan—both repaid on time. My savings amount to 10 DM, but my stable employment and determination to support my 12-year-old brother, who lives with me, ensure I will prioritize repayments.  

As a foreign worker from Portugal, I take pride in my financial responsibility. I kindly request your approval for this loan.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully,
