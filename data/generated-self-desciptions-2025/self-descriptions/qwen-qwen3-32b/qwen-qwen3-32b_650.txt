Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required elements.

First, the profile details: The person has a checking account with at least 200 DM and a salary assigned there for over a year. The loan duration is 24 months, purpose is a new car, amount 947 DM. They have a good credit history, existing credits paid back. Savings account less than 100 DM. Employed for 4-7 years. Installment rate 4. Single male, no other debtors. Residence for 3 years. No property. Age 38. Other installment plans with the bank. Housing is free. One existing credit at the bank. Job is skilled employee or official. Two dependents. No telephone. Foreign worker yes.

I need to create five different people with specific jobs, maybe different nationalities, and unique situations. Let me brainstorm some roles. For example, a scientific research assistant, a teacher, an IT technician, a mechanic, and a healthcare worker. Each should have a distinct reason for needing the loan. 

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They must mention their stable employment, existing credit history, residence duration, and other factors from the profile. Also, since they're foreign workers, maybe mention their immigration status or how they've established themselves in the country.

Let me start with the first one. Let's pick a scientific research assistant. He's been working at a university for 6 years. He needs a car to commute because he lives 45 minutes away. He has no savings but has a steady income. He's paid back previous loans. He's single with two kids. Maybe he's from a country like India or China. 

Second, a teacher. Let's say he's a high school teacher with 5 years of experience. He needs a car for transporting students on field trips. He's been in the same residence for 3 years. His dependents are his parents living with him. He's from the Philippines.

Third, an IT technician. He works for a company, has 5 years there. Needs a car for client visits. He's a foreign worker from Vietnam. Single, two children. Lives in the same place for three years.

Fourth, a mechanic. He's been working at a garage for 6 years. Needs a car to reach different job sites. From Mexico. No savings but steady income. Two dependents.

Fifth, a healthcare worker, maybe a nurse. Worked in a clinic for 5 years. Needs a car to commute long distances. From the Philippines. Single mother with two kids.

I need to make sure each letter includes all the profile points: checking account status, employment duration, credit history, purpose, amount, savings, residence, age, job, dependents, foreign worker. Also, each should have a unique angle. Avoid repetition in reasons for the loan. Maybe vary the purposes slightly even if they're all cars. For example, commuting, work requirements, family needs, etc.

Check that each letter is concise, not too long. Start with addressing the bank, introduce self, state purpose, explain financial situation, mention trustworthiness through past payments, and conclude with thanks and contact info. Make sure not to use any formatting, just plain text. Also, ensure that each letter ends properly without being cut off.

Let me draft the first one:

Scientific Research Assistant: Name, job, employer, duration. Need a car for commute. Financially stable, salary assigned for over a year. Paid previous loans. No savings but steady income. Lives in same residence for 3 years. Two kids. Foreign worker. Trustworthy because of job stability and payment history.

Second letter: Teacher. Similar structure. Maybe mention how the car helps in his job responsibilities. His dependents are parents, so maybe he's supporting them. Still, same financial details.

Third: IT Technician. Car needed for client meetings. Emphasize that reliable transportation is crucial for his job performance. Maybe mention that his current vehicle is old and unreliable.

Fourth: Mechanic. Car is necessary to reach job sites. Without a reliable car, he can't perform his job efficiently. His current car is broken down.

Fifth: Nurse. Long hours and needing to commute. Maybe she works night shifts and needs a car for flexibility. Single mother, so reliability is important for her family.

Make sure each has specific numbers: e.g., 6 years at job, 3 years at residence, 38 years old, etc. Mention the exact loan amount and term. Also, note that they have another installment plan with the bank, so maybe mention that they're already managing a loan responsibly.

Check that each letter is unique in the specifics but covers all required points. Avoid using the same phrases. Vary the language to show different personalities. Also, since they don't have a telephone, maybe they provide an address or mention they can be contacted through their workplace.

Alright, time to write each letter with these details in mind.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Rajesh Kumar, and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have worked for the past six years. I am applying for a 947 DM loan to purchase a new car, as my current vehicle is unreliable and I need dependable transportation to commute 45 minutes daily to work. I have held a checking account with your bank for over a year, with a consistent salary deposit. I have no savings but have always paid my existing credit—my student loan—on time. I am 38 years old, single, and support two dependents: my daughter and son. I have lived at my current residence for three years and am a foreign worker from India with no property. I trust my stable employment, punctual repayment history, and long-term residence make me a reliable candidate. I look forward to your positive response.  

Sincerely  
Rajesh Kumar
