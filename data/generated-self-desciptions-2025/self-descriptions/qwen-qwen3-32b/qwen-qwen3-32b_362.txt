Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Let me start by understanding the profile details. 

First, the person has a checking account with less than 200 DM, has had it for 18 months. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is education, credit amount is 1239 DM. Savings account is unknown or none. Employment duration is 1-4 years. Single male, no other debtors, residence since 4 years, no property, age 61, housing for free, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee or official, one dependent, no phone, foreign worker.

Each letter needs to be from a different person with specific instances. Let me break down the generic attributes into specific ones. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "scientific research assistant," "technical draftsman," etc. Also, need specific durations like "8 years" instead of ">=7 years." 

First, I'll create five different personas. Let's think of different job roles: maybe a teacher, a mechanic, a nurse, an office clerk, and a technician. Each will have unique reasons for the education loan. Maybe they want to upskill for career advancement, get a certification, or switch fields.

For each letter, they need to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Since they have a good credit history, that's a point to mention. Also, they have one existing credit paid back duly. They are foreign workers, so maybe they mention their stable employment. 

I need to make sure each letter is concise, starts with their name and address, then the bank's address. They should state their purpose clearly, mention their job, duration, and how they'll repay. Also, since they have dependents, maybe mention supporting their family through education.

Let me outline each person:

1. Scientific Research Assistant: Wants to attend a specialized course to advance in his field. Employed at a university for 3 years. Has a dependent child. Emphasizes punctual repayment of existing loan.

2. Technical Draftsman: Needs funds for a CAD certification. Works at a construction firm, 2 years employed. Lives in the same residence for 4 years. Highlights steady income and no delinquencies.

3. Nursing Assistant: Pursuing a bachelor's degree to become a nurse. Works part-time at a clinic, 1.5 years there. Has a dependent parent. Mentions housing is free, so more funds available for installments.

4. Office Administrator: Wants to take a management course. Employed at a non-profit for 3 years. Emphasizes foreign worker status and commitment to repaying the loan as part of their responsibility.

5. Machinery Maintenance Technician: Applying for a vocational training program. Works at a manufacturing plant for 2.5 years. Has a dependent spouse. Points out existing credit managed well and stable job.

Each letter should start with their personal details, then the bank's address. They need to state the purpose, their employment history, current financial status (checking account, no savings), and why they're trustworthy (good credit history, stable job). Also, mention the installment rate and how they can manage payments. Conclude with thanks and willingness to provide more info.

I need to avoid generic terms and use specifics from the profile. Also, ensure each letter is unique in the person's situation but fits the profile constraints. Check that each has the correct duration of employment (1-4 years), age 61, residence since 4 years, etc. Wait, age 61? That seems high for someone with only 1-4 years at a job. Maybe they changed jobs recently? Or perhaps it's a translation error. Maybe the age is 26? Wait, the original profile says age:61. Hmm, that's a conflict. If the person is 61, having a job for only 1-4 years might be unusual. Maybe they recently moved to the country as a foreign worker. Since the profile says foreign worker: yes, maybe they are older but newly employed there. So in the letters, perhaps mention that they moved recently and have been working there for, say, 2 years.

Also, housing is "for free," so maybe they live with family or have free accommodation. Dependents: 1, so maybe a child or elderly parent. Need to reflect that in each letter.

Each letter should be short, so I need to be concise. Let me start drafting each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered with specific examples.

Dear Loan Committee,  

I am writing to request a loan of 1,239 DM to enroll in a specialized course on renewable energy systems. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Cityville for the past three years, I aim to enhance my expertise to contribute to ongoing climate projects. My current employment provides a stable income, and I have consistently repaid my existing bank credit for vehicle maintenance. Though my checking account balance is modest (150 DM), I reside with family, which covers housing costs and supports my dependent daughter. I am confident in managing monthly installments, given my punctual payment history and the university’s commitment to my professional development. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmad Al-Mansouri
