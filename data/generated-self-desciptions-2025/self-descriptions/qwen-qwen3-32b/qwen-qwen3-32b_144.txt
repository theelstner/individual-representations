Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on the provided profile. First, I need to parse the profile carefully to make sure each letter includes all the specific details.

The profile mentions a foreign worker, age 27, male, single, with a dependent. He has a checking account with less than 0 DM, a 27-month duration. Credit history shows existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is radio/television, credit amount 3416 DM. Savings under 100 DM. Employment since 1-4 years, installment rate 3. He has a car or other property, owns housing, has one existing credit at the bank, job in management/self-employed/highly qualified employee/officer. No telephone, no other installment plans, no debtors/guarantors, residence since 2 years.

Each letter needs to be unique, with specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs like "scientific research assistant." Also, need to vary the purposes within radio/television, maybe different aspects like equipment purchase, course, studio upgrade, marketing, etc.

First, I'll brainstorm different roles and scenarios. Let's think of five distinct job roles: maybe a self-employed filmmaker, a radio station manager, a TV production coordinator, a media consultant, and a broadcast engineer. Each has different reasons for needing the loan.

For each person, I need to explain their financial situation, why they need the loan, and why they're trustworthy. They all have a good credit history, so that's a common point. Also, mention their employment duration, residence, and existing credit. Since they're foreign workers, maybe mention their commitment to the country.

Need to ensure each letter is concise but covers all necessary points. Avoid generic terms, use specific numbers from the profile. For example, "I have been employed as... for 3 years" since present employment is 1-4 years. Age is 27, so maybe mention being young but experienced.

Check that each letter starts with the applicant's name, address, date, and proper structure. Also, ensure that the purpose varies but stays within radio/television. Maybe one wants to buy equipment, another to expand, another for a course, another for studio upgrade, another for marketing.

Need to make sure that each letter ends properly, thanking the bank and expressing willingness to provide more info. Also, avoid any formatting as per the user's request.

Let me start drafting each letter, making sure to vary the specifics and roles while adhering to the profile constraints. Check for each attribute: existing credit paid back, savings <100 DM, etc. Also, since they have a dependent, mention that in each letter, maybe a child or relative.

Double-check that each letter is unique and doesn't repeat the same scenarios. Make sure the financial situation is explained clearly, showing responsibility despite current checking account being negative. Emphasize timely repayment of past credits to establish trustworthiness.

Alright, time to put it all together into five distinct letters.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
My name is Luca Moretti, and I am a 27-year-old freelance filmmaker specializing in documentary production. I have been self-employed for 3 years and currently reside in Munich with my 5-year-old son. While my checking account balance is temporarily negative due to recent equipment repairs, I have consistently repaid my existing car loan of 2,500 DM on time for 18 months. The loan of 3,416 DM I request is to purchase professional editing software and a high-quality camera to expand my business. My savings account holds 80 DM, but I have a stable income from ongoing projects with local TV stations. As a foreign worker committed to Germany, I own my apartment and prioritize financial responsibility. I kindly ask for your trust in my ability to repay this loan within 24 months.  

Sincerely,  
Luca Moretti
