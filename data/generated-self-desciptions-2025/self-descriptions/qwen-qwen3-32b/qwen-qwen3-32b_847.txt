Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on a specific profile. The profile has various attributes that need to be converted from generic terms to specific instances. 

First, I need to parse the profile details. The existing checking account has a balance between 0 and 200 DM, duration 21 months. Credit history shows all previous credits paid back. The purpose is furniture/equipment, amount 3976 DM. Savings account unknown or none. Employment duration 4-7 years. Installment rate 2. Male, single, no debtors/guarantors. Residence since 3 years. Property: car or other. Age 35. No other installment plans. Own housing. One existing credit at the bank. Job: skilled employee/official. Dependents: 1. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered under their name.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I should vary the job roles, specific financial situations, and reasons for the loan. For example, instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs like "scientific research assistant," "mechanic," "IT technician," etc. Also, the purpose is furniture/equipment, so maybe different scenarios: buying a desk for home office, kitchen appliances, etc.

I need to ensure each letter includes why they're applying, their financial situation, and trustworthiness. They should be concise, not cut off, and properly ended. No formatting, just plain text.

Let me brainstorm five different roles. Maybe:

1. Scientific Research Assistant
2. Automotive Mechanic
3. IT Support Technician
4. Electrician
5. Administrative Assistant

Each will have different reasons for needing furniture/equipment. For example, the research assistant might need a desk and chair for a home office, the mechanic might need tools for a workshop, etc.

Check the numbers: existing credit paid back, so mention that. Each should mention their stable job, duration, residence, and existing credit with the bank. Also, dependents (1 child), own housing, and telephone.

Make sure each letter is distinct in details but adheres to the profile. Avoid repetition. Let me start drafting each one, ensuring all profile attributes are covered with specific examples.

Dear [Bank Name],  

My name is Lars Müller, 35, a scientific research assistant at the University of Dresden with a stable income of 2,800 DM monthly. I have been employed in this role for 5 years and maintain a checking account with your bank for 21 months, though my balance fluctuates between 0 and 200 DM due to irregular project reimbursements. I am applying for a 3,976 DM loan to purchase a new desk and ergonomic chair for my home office, which is essential for my 40-hour workweek. I have no savings account but have consistently repaid my existing 1,500 DM car loan with your bank over 24 months. My residence in Leipzig has lasted 3 years, and I own a 2018 Volkswagen Golf as collateral. With one dependent (my daughter) and a fixed installment capacity of 2 DM, I assure timely repayments. My registered foreign worker status and university employment confirm my reliability. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

Dear [Bank Name],  

I am Thomas Becker, 35, a certified automotive mechanic at AutoTech Berlin, where I’ve worked for 6 years. My monthly salary is 3,100 DM, and I’ve maintained a checking account for 21 months with occasional low balances. I seek a 3,976 DM loan to upgrade my workshop tools, which are outdated and hinder efficiency. I’ve fully repaid a prior 2,000 DM loan for vehicle repairs. Though I lack a savings account, my 3-year tenancy in a rented apartment and steady job ensure financial stability. I own a motorcycle valued at 1,200 DM. With one child and a 2 DM installment plan, I am committed to disciplined repayments. My employer confirms my reliability, and my registered foreign worker status adds credibility. I request your approval to invest in my professional growth.  

Respectfully,  
Thomas Becker
