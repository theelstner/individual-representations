Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants five motivation letters for a bank loan application, each from a different person based on a specific profile. First, I need to understand the profile details thoroughly. 

The profile includes various attributes like a checking account balance between 0 and 200 DM, a duration of 7 months, a credit history of paid-back credits, purpose for radio/television, credit amount 2576 DM, savings under 100 DM, employment duration 1-4 years, single male, guarantor, residence since 2 years, real estate, age 35, own housing, one dependent, no phone, foreign worker. 

I need to create five distinct individuals. Each should have unique names and specific instances of the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "electrician," "mechanic," etc. Each letter must explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy.

First, I'll list out the key points each letter must include: purpose (radio/television), credit amount, existing credit history, employment details, residence, guarantor, etc. Then, vary the job roles, names, and specific circumstances. 

For each person, I need to make sure they mention their job (different skilled jobs), how long they've been employed, their savings, residence, and the guarantor. Also, since they're foreign workers, maybe mention their country of origin or specific reasons for moving. 

I should avoid repetition in the reasons for the loan within the purpose category. Maybe one wants a radio for a small business, another for educational purposes, another for a family need, etc. 

Check that each letter is concise, starts with their personal details, explains the purpose, financial situation, and trustworthiness. Make sure not to use any formatting and that each ends properly. Also, ensure that all the profile attributes are covered in each letter but presented naturally. 

Let me start drafting each one step by step, ensuring each has unique elements while adhering to the profile constraints. Let me also check for proper grammar and flow. Finally, verify that each letter is self-contained and addresses the bank appropriately.

Dear Bank Manager  
My name is Ahmed Mohamed, a 35-year-old electrician working at a construction firm in Frankfurt. I have been employed there for 2.5 years and earn a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. I am applying for a 2,576 DM loan to purchase a television for my family, as my current one is beyond repair. I currently reside in my own apartment in Hanover, where I have lived for the past 2 years. I maintain a checking account with your bank, though my balance fluctuates between 50 and 150 DM due to irregular utility payments. I have a guarantor, my cousin Karim, who is a certified welder with 10 years of experience. I have repaid all previous credits responsibly, including a 1,200 DM loan for tools in 2021. With my steady job and real estate as collateral, I am confident in repaying this installment of 2 DM per month. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Mohamed
