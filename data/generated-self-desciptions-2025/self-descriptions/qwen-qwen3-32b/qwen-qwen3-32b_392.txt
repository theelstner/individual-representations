Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile says the person has no checking account. Wait, that's a bit tricky because usually, you need a checking account for loans. Maybe they have a different setup? Maybe they use a savings account or another method. I'll have to address that in the letters, perhaps by mentioning they manage finances through a savings account or directly.

Duration in months is 18, so about 1.5 years at the current job. The credit history mentions existing credits paid back duly. Each applicant has a purpose of buying a new car, credit amount 1820 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Present employment since 1-4 years. The person is a male, married or widowed, with dependents of 1. Installment rate is 2, which might refer to the monthly payment? Not sure, but I'll note that. Other debtors or guarantors: none. Residence since 2 years. Property: building society savings or life insurance. Age 30. No other installment plans. Housing is own. Number of existing credits at the bank: 1. Job: management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, or officer. Telephone: yes. Foreign worker registered under their name.

So each letter needs to have these specifics. Let me think of different jobs from the job category. For example: scientific research assistant, management trainee, self-employed consultant, officer in the military, or maybe a project manager. Each person will have different circumstances but same profile attributes.

First person: Let's pick a scientific research assistant. He's 30, married with one child. Employed for 2 years at a university. Has a life insurance policy. No checking account but manages through savings. Existing credit paid back (maybe a previous loan for equipment). Applying for a car to commute to work. Trustworthy because of timely payments, stable job, and savings.

Second person: Management trainee at a corporate company. 30, widowed with one dependent. Employed for 3 years. Owns a house. Has a building society savings. Needs a car for work-related travel. No checking account, but uses direct deposits. Trustworthy due to responsible history.

Third person: Self-employed IT consultant. 30, married, 1 child. Been in business for 3 years. Has a savings account with some money. Needs a car for client visits. Has a life insurance. Existing credit for office setup paid back. Trustworthy because of steady income and punctual payments.

Fourth person: Officer in the military. 30, married, 1 child. Stationed in a different city, moved 2 years ago. Has housing in own name. Needs a car for commuting. Has a building society agreement. No checking account, uses military pay directly. Trustworthy due to service and credit history.

Fifth person: Highly qualified employee in healthcare, maybe a nurse or medical officer. 30, widowed, 1 dependent. Works at a hospital for 2.5 years. Owns home. Needs a car for shifts. Has life insurance. Trustworthy because of stable employment and responsible credit history.

Now, each letter should start with sender's info, date, bank address, subject. Then explain the purpose, financial situation, why trustworthy. Make sure to mention no checking account, but maybe savings or direct deposits. Each with specific job, duration, etc. Keep it concise, no formatting, proper ending.

Need to ensure that each letter is distinct in the person's situation but fits the profile. Also, avoid generic terms, use specific examples like "scientific research assistant at XYZ University" instead of just "skilled employee". Check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter. Also, the loan amount is 1820 DM, which is the amount they're applying for. The installment rate is 2, maybe DM per month? Not sure, but maybe just mention the monthly payment capacity.

Let me start drafting each letter one by one, making sure each has unique scenarios but adheres to the profile.

Subject: Motivation Letter for Car Loan Application  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,820 DM to support my daily commute as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysics in Frankfurt. At 30 years old, I have been employed in this role for 2.5 years, managing experiments and data analysis for a team of 10 researchers. My stable income of 3,200 DM monthly allows me to repay installments of 2 DM promptly.  

Though I currently do not maintain a checking account, I manage my finances through a savings account with 85 DM, ensuring disciplined spending. I have a life insurance policy worth 15,000 DM and own a residence in my name, having lived there for 2 years. My previous credit—a 5,000 DM loan for laboratory equipment—was repaid in full over 18 months.  

As a married man with one child, I prioritize financial responsibility. My employer values my contributions, and my 8-year tenure in scientific research underscores my reliability. I kindly request your approval, confident in my ability to meet repayment terms.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Subject: Application for New Car Loan  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 1,820 DM loan to purchase a vehicle for my role as a management trainee at Siemens AG in Munich. At 30, I have worked there for 3 years, overseeing logistics for renewable energy projects. My monthly salary of 3,800 DM supports a household of two, including my 6-year-old daughter.  

I do not hold a checking account but use direct deposits into my savings account. My credit history includes a fully repaid 8,000 DM student loan over 4 years. I own a home in my name, residing there for 2 years, and possess a building society savings agreement with 90 DM.  

The car will improve my efficiency during 15-hour weekly workdays and client visits. With no existing debts beyond this bank’s 1,200 DM equipment loan (repaid for 12 months), I am committed to timely repayments. Your trust would be deeply appreciated.  

Yours faithfully,  
[Your Name]

Subject: Request for Car Loan Approval  

Dear [Bank Officer’s Name],  

As a self-employed IT consultant in Berlin, I apply for a 1,820 DM loan to acquire a vehicle for client site visits. At 30, I have operated my business for 3 years, earning an average of 4,500 DM monthly. My wife and I, with our 2-year-old son, rely on this income, which I deposit into a savings account (current balance: 70 DM).  

Though I lack a checking account, my clients pay via direct transfer, and I maintain records with a registered foreign accountant. My sole existing credit—a 10,000 DM loan for office setup—was repaid over 24 months. I own a condominium, residing there for 2 years, and hold life insurance covering 20,000 DM.  

This car will reduce travel costs and expand my client base. I assure you of punctual 2 DM installments, supported by my stable income and disciplined financial habits. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
[Your Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am a 30-year-old officer in the German Air Force, stationed in Neubrandenburg. Married with one child, I require a car for 80 km daily commutes to my base. My 3-year military contract guarantees a steady income of 3,500 DM monthly, with 2 DM allocated for loan repayments.  

I own a home purchased 2 years ago and hold a building society savings agreement with 60 DM. Though I do not maintain a checking account, my salary is automatically deposited, and I have no other debts beyond this bank’s 1,500 DM emergency loan (fully repaid over 10 months).  

My service record and punctual credit history—specifically a 2021 housing-related loan—demonstrate reliability. This vehicle will ensure punctuality for duty and family obligations. I respectfully request your approval.  

Sincerely,

Dear [Bank Officer’s Name],  

As a 30-year-old senior nurse at Charité Hospital in Berlin, I apply for a 1,820 DM loan to replace my aging car. Widowed with one daughter, I work 12-hour shifts and earn 3,700 DM monthly. My 2.5-year tenure at the hospital and 8-year experience in critical care reflect my dedication.  

I reside in my own apartment for 2 years and have a life insurance policy worth 18,000 DM. Though I do not use a checking account, my salary is deposited into a savings account (balance: 45 DM). My only existing credit—a 6,000 DM medical equipment loan—was repaid in 18 months.  

This car will ensure timely attendance at night shifts and parent-teacher meetings. With no other debts and a proven track of repaying 1 credit at this bank, I am confident in meeting repayment terms. Thank you for your consideration.  

Yours truly,
