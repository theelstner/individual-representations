Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the points.

First, the profile details: checking account balance less than 200 DM, 24 months duration. Credit history is good, existing credits paid back. Purpose is others, credit amount 11328 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Employment duration 1-4 years. Single male, co-applicant. Residence since 3 months. Property is car or other. Age 29. Other installment plans with bank. Housing is own. Two existing credits at the bank. Job in management/self-employed/highly qualified. One dependent. Has a telephone. Foreign worker registered.

Each letter needs to be from a different person. So I need to vary the job roles, purposes, and specific details. Let me think of five different jobs from the profile's job category. The job category includes management, self-employed, highly qualified employee, officer. Let me pick five distinct roles: maybe project manager, freelance graphic designer, IT systems officer, restaurant owner, and scientific research assistant. That should cover different angles.

For each person, I need to explain why they're applying for the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. The purpose is "others," so I need to come up with specific purposes. Maybe expanding a business, purchasing equipment, covering a family expense, education, or a personal project.

Let me start with the first one. A project manager. He could be looking to expand his team or get new equipment. His checking account is low, but he has a stable job. He mentions his credit history and existing credits. He has a co-applicant, maybe his spouse or a business partner. He lives in his own house, has a car, and has been employed for 3 years. He can mention his timely repayments and the specific use of the loan.

Second, a freelance graphic designer. Self-employed, so maybe he needs funds for software or client projects. His savings are low because he's self-employed with variable income. He's been in his residence for 3 years, has a co-applicant (maybe a family member). He can highlight his steady clients and previous credit management.

Third, an IT systems officer. Purpose could be upgrading home office equipment to work remotely, which is necessary for his job. He has existing credits with the bank, shows reliability. Maybe he's taking a co-applicant for support. His stable employment and own housing are points to mention.

Fourth, a restaurant owner. He needs funds for kitchen upgrades. Being self-employed, he might have irregular income, but he's managed previous credits. The loan purpose is specific, and he has a co-applicant (partner). His property is a car used for deliveries, and he's been in his own housing.

Fifth, a scientific research assistant. Maybe needs funds for specialized lab equipment or conference attendance. Has a stable job, good credit history. Co-applicant could be a spouse. The loan is for professional development, which will enhance his income. He's been in his job for 8 years, which is within the 1-4 years range? Wait, the profile says present employment since 1 <= ... <4 years. So each person should have 1 to 4 years in their current job. Let me check the example given: "8 years" instead of ">=7 years". So I need to pick numbers between 1-4 years. For example, 3 years as a project manager, 2 years as a freelance designer, 4 years as IT officer, 1 year as restaurant owner, 3 years as research assistant. That works.

Each letter should be concise, not too long. Start with addressing the bank, state the purpose, mention financial situation (checking account, savings, employment duration), credit history, co-applicant, residence, property, and why they're trustworthy. End with thanks and signature.

Let me make sure each letter has unique details. For example, different purposes, different jobs, different co-applicants (spouse, partner, family member), and specific numbers. Also, check that all profile attributes are covered in each letter. Let me go through each point:

- Checking account: less than 200 DM. Mentioned in each letter.
- Duration: 24 months. Each person has a checking account for 2 years.
- Credit history: existing credits paid back. Each mentions this.
- Purpose: others. Each has a specific purpose.
- Credit amount: 11328 DM. Each applies for this amount.
- Savings: less than 100 DM. Mentioned.
- Employment duration: 1-4 years. Each has a specific number.
- Single male. All letters are from single males.
- Co-applicant. Each has one, different relations.
- Residence since 3 months. Each has lived there 3 months.
- Property: car or other. Each has a car or something else.
- Age 29. All are 29.
- Other installment plans: bank. Mentioned in each.
- Housing: own. Each owns their home.
- Existing credits at the bank: 2. Each has two.
- Job: specific roles as discussed.
- Dependents: 1. Each has one.
- Telephone: yes. Mentioned.
- Foreign worker: registered. Each has this.

Now, writing the letters. Let me start with the first one.

First letter: Project Manager. Purpose: expand team. Checking account low but stable. Credit history good. Co-applicant is his sister. Residence 3 months. Owns a car. Employment 3 years. Two existing credits. Wants to hire an assistant to take on more projects. Trustworthy because of timely payments and stable income.

Second letter: Freelance graphic designer. Purpose: invest in software. Savings low due to self-employment. Employment duration 2 years. Co-applicant is his mother. Needs better tools to increase income. Trustworthy because of timely repayments on existing credits.

Third letter: IT systems officer. Purpose: upgrade home office equipment. Needs to work remotely. Has existing credits. Co-applicant is his brother. Stable job, owns home. Trustworthy due to good credit history.

Fourth letter: Restaurant owner. Purpose: kitchen equipment. Self-employed, 1 year in current job. Co-applicant is his partner. Irregular income but managed previous loans. Trustworthy because of timely payments.

Fifth letter: Scientific research assistant. Purpose: conference and equipment. Needs to attend a conference for career growth. Co-applicant is his father. Stable job, 3 years employed. Trustworthy with good credit.

Each letter should be structured similarly but with unique details. Make sure they are short, no markdown, proper endings. Let me draft each one now.
