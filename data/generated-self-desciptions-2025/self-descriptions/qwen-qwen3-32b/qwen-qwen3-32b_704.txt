Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all required elements.

First, the profile includes details like having a checking account with at least 200 DM, salary assigned for at least a year, 24-month loan term, good credit history, purpose for radio/television, credit amount 1377 DM, savings between 100-500 DM, employed for at least 7 years, installment rate 4, female, divorced/separated/married, no other debtors, residence for 2 years, no property, age 47, no other installment plans, housing for free, one existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee/official, one dependent, has a telephone, and foreign worker registered.

Each letter needs to be unique but adhere to these specifics. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different job roles, reasons for needing the TV/radio, different family situations, etc. Let me brainstorm five different angles:

1. A scientific research assistant who wants a TV for her child's education.
2. A teacher needing a radio for her language learning classes.
3. A nurse applying for a TV to have a home entertainment system after long shifts.
4. An office administrator needing a radio for a small business project.
5. A librarian wanting a TV to stay updated with current affairs for her job.

Each person should mention their job title, duration of employment (at least 7 years), their savings, existing credit history, and why they're trustworthy. Also, they should explain the purpose clearly. Let me start drafting each letter, making sure to include all the required elements without being too generic. Need to avoid formatting, keep them concise, and end properly. Let me check each attribute is covered in each letter. Also, ensure each has a unique scenario but fits the profile. Let me make sure each has a specific job, 8 years employed, savings between 100-500 DM, etc. Also, mention the installment rate and how they can manage it. Each should have a dependent, be female, and have a telephone. Maybe vary the reasons for the loan within the radio/TV category. Alright, let me put this together.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Anna Müller and I am a scientific research assistant at the local university where I have worked for 8 years. I am writing to apply for a loan of 1377 DM to purchase a television for my household. I currently reside in my apartment which I have occupied for 2 years and maintain a checking account with a minimum balance of 200 DM alongside a savings account holding 420 DM. I have a stable income with salary assignments for over 1 year and have consistently repaid previous credits in full. As a married woman with one dependent I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. My current employment provides sufficient income to manage the 4 DM installment rate comfortably. I kindly request your approval based on my reliable credit history and steady job as a skilled employee.  

Sincerely  
Anna Müller

Dear Bank Manager  

I am Christine Becker a certified teacher at the municipal school where I have been employed for 7 years. I seek a loan of 1377 DM to acquire a radio for my language learning classes which will enhance educational resources for students. My checking account meets the 200 DM minimum requirement and I have maintained a savings bond valued at 315 DM. I have no other outstanding credits except for the one existing credit at this bank which I have paid diligently. Living in my rented residence for 2 years I am a divorced mother of one and have a stable income to cover the 4 DM monthly installment. My job history and prompt repayment of past debts demonstrate my trustworthiness. I hope you will consider my application.  

Sincerely  
Christine Becker
