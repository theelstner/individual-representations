Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has a checking account with 0 to less than 200 DM, duration 7 months. Credit history is good, paid back all credits. Purpose is radio/television. Credit amount is 2415 DM. Savings account less than 100 DM. Employment since 1 to less than 4 years. Single male, has a guarantor, residence since 2 years, property is real estate, age 34, no other installment plans, housing is own, one existing credit at the bank, job is skilled employee or official, one dependent, no telephone, foreign worker yes.

So each letter needs to be from a different person. Let me think of different scenarios. Maybe different job roles, different reasons for needing the loan (though purpose is radio/TV, maybe they have specific uses), different guarantors, maybe different countries of origin as foreign workers.

Let me start with the first person. Let's pick a job: scientific research assistant. He's been employed for 2 years. Maybe he's from India. His guarantor could be his sister. He wants to buy a TV for his child's education, to have access to online learning resources. He mentions his stable job and real estate as security.

Second person: maybe a teacher. Let's say he's from the Philippines, working as a primary school teacher for 3 years. Guarantor is his uncle. He wants a TV for language learning for his dependent. He emphasizes his savings and real estate.

Third person: technical draftsman from Vietnam. Employed for 1.5 years. Guarantor is his brother. Needs a TV for his daughter's online classes. Mentions his credit history and housing.

Fourth: office administrator from Nigeria. Employed for 2 years. Guarantor is his cousin. Wants a TV to stay updated with work training. Talks about his stable job and real estate.

Fifth: IT support specialist from Brazil. Employed for 3 years. Guarantor is his father. Needs a TV for his son's educational programs. Highlights his timely payments and property.

I need to make sure each has specific details: exact job titles, countries, family relations, specific reasons tied to the TV/radio purpose. Also, mention their financial stability, existing credit paid, guarantor, residence duration, etc. Each letter should be concise, not too long, proper structure with greeting, body, closing. No formatting, just plain text. Make sure to end each letter properly. Avoid repetition in the reasons and guarantors. Check that all profile attributes are addressed in each letter. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they meet the criteria.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Rajesh Kumar, a 34-year-old scientific research assistant employed at the City Research Institute for the past two years. I am applying for a 2415 DM loan to purchase a television for my household. As a foreign worker from India, I have maintained a stable income and reside in my own apartment, which I own, for the past two years. My current employer has confirmed my position, and my sister, who lives locally, serves as a guarantor for this loan. I have a one-year-old daughter and have consistently repaid my existing credit with your bank. Though my savings account holds less than 100 DM, I am committed to fulfilling this new installment of 3 DM monthly. I kindly request your trust in my reliability and financial responsibility.  

Sincerely,  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Bank Manager  

I am Tarek Mohamed, 34, a primary school teacher at Greenfield School, employed there for three years. I seek a 2415 DM loan to acquire a television to support my 5-year-old son’s language learning through educational programs. I have lived at my current residence for two years and own real estate in my hometown in Egypt. My uncle, a respected businessman, guarantees this loan. While my checking account balance is modest (150 DM), I have no other debts and have always repaid my sole existing credit with your bank on time. My stable salary and property ensure I can manage the monthly installment. I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling this obligation.  

Thank you for your consideration.
