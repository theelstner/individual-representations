Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I cover all the details.

First, the profile includes a checking account with less than 0 DM, 24 months duration. Credit history is good, existing credits paid back. Purpose is furniture/equipment. Credit amount 3345 DM. Savings under 100 DM. Employment since at least 7 years. Single male, no dependents except one (maybe a child?), residence since 2 years. Property is building society savings or life insurance. Age 39. No other installment plans. Renting. One existing credit at the bank. Job in management, self-employed, or highly qualified employee. Has a telephone, foreign worker registered.

Each letter needs to be unique. Let me think of different job roles: maybe a scientific research assistant, a project manager, a self-employed IT consultant, a senior office manager, and a freelance graphic designer. Each with specific details.

For each person, they need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. Let me start with the first one.

First person: Scientific research assistant. He needs furniture for a home office. He's been working at a university for 8 years. Has a stable income, existing credit paid back. Savings are low because he's been paying monthly into a building society. Lives in a rented apartment, has a dependent (maybe a child). Uses the phone for work communication. Trustworthy because of his stable job and good credit history.

Second person: Project manager in construction. Applying for equipment (tools for his job). Employed for 7 years. Has a life insurance policy. His savings are low because he invested in a building society. Has a dependent. Trustworthy due to long-term employment and existing credit.

Third: Self-employed IT consultant. Needs furniture for client meetings. Been self-employed for 9 years. Savings in building society. Trustworthy because of consistent income and timely payments. Lives in a rented place, has a dependent.

Fourth: Senior office manager. Wants to buy office equipment for her job. Employed 8 years. Property is life insurance. Savings low but has a good credit history. Trustworthy due to stable job and existing credit.

Fifth: Freelance graphic designer. Needs a new computer and office setup. Self-employed for 7 years. Savings in building society. Trustworthy because of consistent income and timely payments. Has a dependent, rents.

I need to make sure each letter includes specific numbers and roles, mentions the purpose clearly, financial situation (checking account negative, savings low, existing credit), and reasons for trustworthiness. Also, each letter should end properly without formatting. Let me draft each one step by step, checking the profile attributes each time to ensure all points are covered.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,345 DM to purchase essential furniture for my home office. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed for 8 years with a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. My current checking account balance is negative due to recent equipment repairs, but I have consistently paid back my existing car loan of 1,200 DM over 24 months. I hold a building society savings agreement and maintain a life insurance policy as collateral. Though my savings account holds less than 100 DM, I have no other debts and live in a rented apartment for 2 years. With a dependent child and a registered foreign worker status, I prioritize financial responsibility. My timely repayment history and secure employment make me a reliable candidate. I kindly request your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Schneider

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a loan to upgrade my workshop equipment for my self-employed carpentry business. At 39, I have managed this business for 9 years, generating an average monthly revenue of 3,500 DM. My checking account is temporarily negative due to seasonal cash flow, but I have repaid all prior bank loans, including a 5,000 DM business credit in 2021. I hold a building society savings plan worth 1,500 DM and no other installment obligations. I reside in a rented property for 2 years and have one dependent. My telephone is registered under my business name, and I maintain a clean credit history. My stability and commitment to repayment ensure this loan will be managed responsibly.  

Respectfully,  
Lars Müller

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I apply for a loan to furnish my new rental apartment, as my current furniture is outdated and insufficient. Working as a senior office manager at a pharmaceutical company for 7 years, I earn 3,200 DM monthly. My checking account balance is temporarily negative due to recent medical expenses, but I have no other debts and have fully repaid a prior 2,000 DM credit. I own a life insurance policy and have 80 DM in savings. I have lived in my current residence for 2 years and have one dependent. My long-term employment, existing credit history, and registered foreign worker status reflect my reliability. I assure timely repayment of this loan.  

Gratefully,  
Anna Weber

**Motivation Letter 4**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I require funding to replace my aging laptop and office chair for my freelance graphic design work. As a self-employed designer since 2016, I earn 2,900 DM monthly and have consistently met payment deadlines for my sole existing credit—a 4,000 DM equipment loan. My checking account is currently overdrawn due to a client payment delay, but I maintain a building society savings plan and no other debts. I reside in a rented flat for 2 years, have one dependent, and own a registered telephone. My 8-year self-employment history and disciplined financial habits—evidenced by my repayment record—make me a trustworthy applicant.  

Sincerely,  
Thomas Becker

**Motivation Letter 5**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a loan to purchase ergonomic furniture for my home office, which is critical for my role as a project manager at a construction firm. Employed for 7 years, I earn 3,400 DM monthly and have repaid a prior 3,000 DM credit for tools. My checking account is temporarily negative due to unexpected plumbing repairs, but I have no other debts. I hold a life insurance policy and 50 DM in savings. I have lived in my current residence for 2 years and support one dependent. My stable income, clean credit history, and registered foreign worker status underscore my reliability. I assure you this loan will be repaid punctually.  

Respectfully,  
Jan Hoffmann
