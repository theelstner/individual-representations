Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

The profile says the applicant is a male, single, 50 years old, a skilled employee or official, has been in their current job for 1-4 years, has no checking account, but has existing credits paid back duly. The purpose is furniture/equipment, credit amount 1574 DM. Savings are less than 100 DM. They have real estate property, own housing, no other installment plans, no telephone, foreign worker, and one dependent.

First, I need to create five different individuals. Let me think of different job roles under "skilled employee / official". Maybe a scientific research assistant, a mechanic, a teacher, a nurse, and an IT technician. Each should have specific details.

Each letter needs to explain why they need the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their credit history, current employment, residence, and assets like real estate. Also, since they have no checking account, maybe they manage finances differently. They need to show they can repay.

Let me start with the first one: Scientific Research Assistant. He's 50, works at a university, has a 3-year job duration. Needs furniture for a new home office. Trustworthy because he's paid back previous loans and owns real estate. Dependents: 1. No checking account but uses savings account.

Second: Auto Mechanic. Maybe he's self-employed or works at a garage. Needs equipment for his workshop. Has been in job 2 years. Owns property. Can mention steady income and previous credit responsibility.

Third: Public School Teacher. Stable job, 4 years employed. Needs furniture for their child's room. Emphasize stable income and real estate ownership.

Fourth: Certified Nurse. Works in a clinic, 1.5 years there. Needs to buy medical equipment for home care. Highlight dependents and repayment history.

Fifth: IT Support Technician. Works for a company, 3 years. Needs to upgrade home office equipment. Mention foreign worker status, maybe from another country, and how the loan will help productivity.

Each letter should be concise, start with personal info, purpose, financial stability, repayment ability, and a polite closing. Avoid generic terms, use specific numbers from the profile. Make sure each has unique scenarios but fits the profile constraints.

Check that each has:

- Specific job title and employer
- Exact years in job (within 1-4)
- Reason for loan (specific furniture/equipment)
- Mention of credit history
- Real estate ownership
- No checking account but maybe savings (though less than 100 DM)
- Dependents and residence duration (present residence since: 2 years)

Avoid using formatting, keep paragraphs short. Make sure each letter ends properly without being cut off. Also, ensure the foreign worker aspect is addressed in some way, maybe mentioning their employment status or contributions.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they meet all criteria and are distinct.

**Motivation Letter 1**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
My name is Ahmed Al-Mansouri, a 50-year-old scientific research assistant at the University of Duisburg-Essen. I have worked there for three years, earning a stable monthly income of 2,800 DM. I am applying for a 1,574 DM loan to purchase a new desk and ergonomic chair for my home office, which I use exclusively for research. Though I do not currently hold a checking account, I manage my finances through a savings book and have always repaid my previous credit (a 2,000 DM equipment loan in 2021) without delay. I own real estate in my hometown of Aleppo, Syria, and have resided in my current apartment in Germany for two years. With only one dependent, my sister’s child, I am confident I can manage the 4 DM installment rate. As a foreign worker contributing to academic innovation, I assure you I will honor this loan as I have all my obligations before. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ahmed Al-Mansouri  

**Motivation Letter 2**  
Dear Bank Representative,  
I am Karsten Müller, 50, a certified auto mechanic employed at Weber Garage since January 2022. I seek 1,574 DM to buy a hydraulic lift for my workshop, which will improve service efficiency. I have no checking account but maintain a savings book with 80 DM. My current job provides 2,600 DM monthly, and I have no other credits except a fully repaid car loan in 2020. I own a condominium in Leipzig and have lived at my current address for two years. As a skilled tradesperson with eight years of experience, I am committed to repaying this loan through my steady income. My dependent, my mother, lives with me, and we carefully budget expenses. I hope you will trust my reliability as you have in the past.  

Best regards,  
Karsten Müller  

**Motivation Letter 3**  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am Lena Hartmann, 50, a public school teacher at the Hamburg Central Gymnasium. Since 2021, I have earned 2,400 DM monthly, sufficient to cover my needs and repay the 4 DM installment for this 1,574 DM loan. The funds will purchase a new wardrobe and desk for my daughter, who is starting university next month. Though I have no checking account, I have consistently paid back my prior credit—a 1,200 DM vacation loan in 2022. I own a half-share in a townhouse in Hamburg and have resided at my current address for 24 months. With no other debts or installment plans, my income ensures timely repayment. As an educator with a 15-year career, I take pride in my financial responsibility.  

Respectfully,  
Lena Hartmann

I request 1,574 DM to buy a hospital-grade oxygen concentrator for my father, who has a chronic lung condition. I have no checking account but hold a small savings bond worth 90 DM. My previous credit—a 1,800 DM medical equipment loan in 2023—was repaid in full. I own property in Mumbai, India, and have lived in my German apartment for two years. With one dependent (my father) and no other debts, I am confident in repaying this loan. As a healthcare professional, I prioritize stability and trust, values I have upheld in both my career and financial commitments.  

Yours faithfully,
