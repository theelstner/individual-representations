Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says the person is a skilled employee or official, male, single, 52 years old, has been in their current job for 1-4 years, has a car or other property, lives in their own housing, has a telephone, and is a registered foreign worker. They don't have a checking account, have savings less than 100 DM, and have existing credits paid back. The loan purpose is for radio/television, amount 3077, and they have one existing credit at the bank.

I need to create five different people. Let me think of different job roles. The original example had a scientific research assistant. Others could be a teacher, electrician, IT technician, and maybe a mechanic. Each should have a unique job and specific details.

For each letter, they need to explain why they're applying, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their stable job, repayment history, residence, and maybe their dependents. Also, they don't have a checking account, but have savings under 100 DM. Need to make sure each letter is concise, no formatting, and ends properly.

Let me start with the first one. Maybe a teacher. Name could be Mr. Jan Kovac. He's a high school teacher with 3 years at his job. He wants to buy a TV for his family. He mentions his stable income, timely repayments, owns a car, and lives in his own home. He has a dependent child. Ends with gratitude.

Second, an electrician. Mr. Carlos Mendes, 52, works for a construction company, 2 years there. Needs a radio for his business. Mentions his savings, residence for 4 years, and that he's a responsible person.

Third, IT technician. Mr. Rajesh Patel, works at a tech firm, 3 years. Wants a TV for his daughter's education. Talks about his job stability, owning a car, and being a foreign worker registered.

Fourth, mechanic. Mr. Ahmed Mohamed, auto repair shop, 1.5 years. Needs a radio for his workshop. Mentions his home ownership and timely payments.

Fifth, maybe a public official. Mr. Michael Berger, city administration, 4 years. Wants a TV for family. Emphasizes his long residence, savings, and dependents.

I need to ensure each letter has specific numbers and roles, no generic terms. Also, check that all profile attributes are addressed: no checking account, savings <100 DM, existing credit paid, etc. Each letter should be short, so avoid fluff. Make sure to end with a proper closing, like looking forward to approval and thanking the bank.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Mr Jan Kovac and I am a high school physics teacher with three years of experience at my current job. I am writing to apply for a loan of 3077 DM to purchase a television for my family. As a single father to my 12 year old daughter I believe having access to educational programming will greatly benefit her studies.  

I have been living in my current apartment for four years and own a used car which I purchased two years ago. Though I do not currently hold a checking account I have consistently paid back my previous credit for car repairs on time. My monthly income of 2800 DM allows me to comfortably manage my expenses and I am confident in my ability to repay this loan with the agreed installment rate.  

I kindly request your consideration and am happy to provide any additional documentation needed. Thank you for your time and understanding.  

Sincerely  
Jan Kovac

Dear Bank Manager  

I am Mr Carlos Mendes a certified electrician working for a construction company in Frankfurt. With two years at my current position and a stable monthly income of 3200 DM I am seeking a 3077 DM loan to invest in a professional radio equipment set for my small contracting business.  

I have lived in my residence for four years and own a 2009 Volkswagen Passat. While my savings account holds only 80 DM I have maintained a flawless credit history including my existing loan for tools which I have repaid in full. As a registered foreign worker since 2018 I take pride in my responsibility and punctuality.  

This equipment will significantly improve my ability to secure contracts and I am committed to fulfilling all repayment terms. I would appreciate your support in this endeavor.  

Respectfully  
Carlos Mendes
