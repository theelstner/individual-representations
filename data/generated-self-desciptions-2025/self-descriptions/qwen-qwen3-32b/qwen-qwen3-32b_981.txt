Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the checking account has less than 200 DM. The person has had a checking account for 15 months. Credit history is good here—paid back all credits at the bank. The purpose is a new car, and the amount is 1264 DM. Savings account is between 100-500 DM. Employment duration is 1-4 years. The installment rate is 2. The person is a married or widowed male with no other debtors or guarantors. They've lived in the current residence for 2 years. Property is a building society savings agreement or life insurance. Age is 25. No other installment plans. Housing is rented. Number of existing credits at the bank is 1. Job is skilled employee or official. Dependents: 1. No telephone. Foreign worker: yes.

So each letter needs to be from someone with these specifics. Let me think of different scenarios. Let me vary the jobs first. The job is "skilled employee / official." Let me think of different skilled jobs. Maybe a scientific research assistant, a teacher, a nurse, a mechanic, and a software developer. That gives five different professions.

Each person needs to explain why they're applying for the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their stable employment, existing savings, good credit history, and other factors from the profile.

Let me start with the first one: Scientific Research Assistant. He's 25, married with one dependent. Worked at a research institute for 3 years. Savings account has 400 DM. Existing credit paid back. Needs a car for commuting. Installment rate is 2 DM. Lives in a rented apartment. Has a building society savings agreement. As a foreign worker, maybe he came from another country. Trustworthy because of timely repayments and stable job.

Second, maybe a teacher. Let's say he's a primary school teacher with 2 years of employment. Savings 300 DM. Same structure. Car needed for school duties. Third, a nurse. Worked at a clinic for 3 years. Fourth, a mechanic. Worked at a garage for 2 years. Fifth, maybe a software developer, but since the job is skilled employee, maybe a systems analyst. Let me check the job options again. The profile says "skilled employee / official," so maybe different roles under that category.

Each letter needs to be concise. Start with addressing the bank, state the purpose, mention the credit amount, explain the need, financial situation (employment duration, savings, existing credit paid back), and why they're trustworthy. Conclude with thanks and willingness to provide more info.

Make sure each letter has specific numbers and details. For example, instead of saying "some years," use exact numbers within the given ranges. For example, employment since 2 years (within 1-4), savings between 100-500 DM, say 300 DM, etc.

Also, check that each letter is from a different person with different jobs and maybe different reasons for needing the car. For example, commuting, work requirements, family needs, etc.

Avoid formatting, just plain text with paragraphs separated. Each letter should have a proper ending, not cut off.

Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring all the profile points are covered with specific instances.

Dear Bank Manager  
I am writing to apply for a loan of 1264 DM to purchase a new car. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for 3 years, I require reliable transportation to commute between our main lab and a satellite facility 45 kilometers away. My current savings account holds 400 DM, and I have maintained a checking account with your bank for 15 months without overdrafts. Over the past 8 years as a foreign worker from Poland, I have consistently repaid my sole existing credit—a 2018 loan for laboratory equipment—and now seek this vehicle to reduce my 2-hour daily travel time. My wife and I reside in a rented apartment for 2 years, and I hold a building society savings agreement valued at 1500 DM. With a stable income and no other debts, I am confident in my ability to meet the 2 DM installment rate. Thank you for considering my application.
