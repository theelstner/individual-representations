Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile mentions a checking account with less than 0 DM, so the person might be in a tight financial situation. The credit history is good—existing credits paid back. The purpose is a new car, credit amount 1228 DM. Savings under 100 DM. Employment duration 1-4 years. Female, divorced/separated/married, no other debtors. Residence since 2 months. Real estate as property. Age 24, unskilled job, 1 dependent, no phone, foreign worker.

Each letter needs specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "scientific research assistant." But the job here is "unskilled - resident." So maybe jobs like retail assistant, cleaning staff, etc. Let me think of five different jobs.

1. Retail Sales Associate
2. Cleaning Staff
3. Fast Food Worker
4. Warehouse Assistant
5. Customer Service Clerk

Each person has to explain why they need the loan (car for work commute?), their financial situation (real estate, but low savings), and trustworthiness (good credit history, steady job). Also, they are foreign workers, so maybe mention ties to the community or country.

Check for each letter: purpose (car for work), trustworthiness (paid back credits), current job details with specific roles, maybe mention how the car will help in maintaining employment. Also, note that they have real estate as property, which can be a security point.

Make sure each letter is concise, starts with sender info, date, bank address, subject, body with personal situation, why loan is needed, ability to repay, and a polite closing. Avoid formatting, just plain text.

Let me start drafting each one with different names, jobs, and specific details. Ensure each has unique scenarios but fits the profile. For example, one might need the car for longer commutes, another for reliable transportation to work shifts, etc. Also, mention the existing credit they have with the bank and that they've paid it back.

Subject: Application for Car Loan  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to request a loan of 1,228 DM to purchase a new car. As a retail sales associate at a local supermarket, I work 40-hour weeks but rely on public transport that is unreliable and costly. My current job pays 1,800 DM monthly, with 80% going toward rent and groceries for my 5-year-old daughter. I have repaid a prior bank loan for vocational training (1,500 DM) over 18 months without delay. Though my checking account is currently overdrawn due to recent medical expenses, I own a small apartment valued at 45,000 DM and have no other debts. A car would reduce transportation costs and ensure punctuality, securing my employment. I kindly ask for your trust in my repayment ability.  

Sincerely,  
Amina Diallo

Subject: Request for Auto Financing  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I seek a 1,228 DM loan to buy a used car. Working as a nightshift cleaning staff at a hospital, I earn 1,600 DM monthly but spend 300 DM on taxis to reach my shifts. My husband and I separated last year, and I now support my son alone. I have a 3-year-old credit account for a refrigerator that I repaid fully. While my savings are minimal (90 DM), I own a co-op apartment and have lived here for two years. A car would allow me to work consistently and avoid late fees. I assure timely repayments, as my employer deducts taxes directly.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Morales

**Letter 3**  
Ms. Zofia Nowak

Subject: Application for Vehicle Purchase  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am applying for a 1,228 DM loan to improve my transportation as a fast-food worker. My job at Burger King requires early mornings, but my old scooter broke down, leaving me dependent on crowded buses. I earn 1,700 DM monthly, with 700 DM allocated to childcare for my toddler. I have no overdue debts and repaid a 2,000 DM student loan two years ago. Though my checking account is temporarily negative due to my mother’s care costs, I own a mortgaged house. A car would save 150 DM monthly on transit and ensure I keep my job. I am committed to repayment.  

Yours faithfully,  
Zofia Nowak

Mr. Rajesh Kumar

Subject: Request for Car Loan  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I need a 1,228 DM loan to purchase a vehicle for my warehouse job at a logistics company. My 38-hour weekly shifts require punctuality, but my bicycle is insufficient for the 20km commute. I earn 1,900 DM monthly, with 600 DM spent on my daughter’s schooling. I have a 24-month-old credit history with this bank (a paid TV loan) and no other debts. My savings are low due to recent visa renewal costs, but I own a rented apartment and have lived here for 2 years. A car will reduce travel time and help me qualify for a promotion. I promise disciplined repayments.  

Sincerely,  
Rajesh Kumar

Subject: Application for Auto Loan  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am requesting 1,228 DM to buy a car for my customer service job at a call center. My 9-to-5 schedule is incompatible with late-night public transport, and I often lose hours waiting for trains. I earn 1,750 DM monthly, with 500 DM going toward my son’s daycare. I repaid a 3,000 DM furniture loan in 2022 and have no arrears. My checking account is currently overdrawn due to a family emergency in Egypt, but I own a co-owned apartment. A car would grant me flexibility and reliability. I am confident in repaying this loan as I have done before.  

Respectfully,  
Hana El-Sayed
