Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by breaking down the profile to make sure I include all the required details.

First, the profile has specific attributes: no checking account, 15 months duration, credit history of existing credits paid back, purpose is radio/television, credit amount 1213 DM, savings between 500-1000 DM, employed for at least 7 years, installment rate 4, single male, no other debtors, residence since 3 years, property as building society savings or life insurance, age 47, other installment plans in stores, own housing, 1 existing credit at the bank, job as skilled employee/official, 1 dependent, has a telephone, and foreign worker registered.

Each letter needs to be unique, so I should vary the specific instances. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe use different jobs like scientific research assistant, electrician, teacher, etc. Also, the purpose is radio/television, so maybe each person has a different reason: upgrading equipment for a small business, home entertainment, educational purposes, etc.

Let me start with the first person. Let's say he's a scientific research assistant. He needs the loan for a radio/television to stay updated with research developments. He has been in his current job for 8 years, has a savings account with 600 DM, and lives in his own house. He mentions his punctual repayment of previous credits and his stable employment.

Second person could be an electrician. He wants a TV for his family's entertainment. He's been employed for 7 years, has a building society savings agreement, and has a dependent child. He emphasizes his consistent income and existing credit management.

Third person might be a teacher. She needs a radio for language learning. She's been in her residence for 3 years, has a savings bond of 800 DM, and has no other debts. She highlights her stable job and timely payments.

Fourth person could be an IT support specialist. He's applying for a TV to replace an old one. He's been working for 9 years, has a life insurance policy, and has a registered foreign worker. He mentions his savings and ability to manage installments.

Fifth person might be a mechanical engineer. He needs a radio for a home studio. He's had his job for 10 years, has savings of 900 DM, and owns his home. He emphasizes his long-term employment and reliable payment history.

I need to make sure each letter includes all the profile elements with specific numbers and roles. Also, each should end properly without formatting. Let me check each attribute is covered in each letter: checking account status, duration, credit history, purpose, amount, savings, employment duration, installment rate, personal status, residence, property, age, other plans, housing, existing credits, job, dependents, telephone, foreign worker. Each letter should have these but with varied specifics. I'll make sure the language is concise and each letter is from a different perspective with unique reasons and details.

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Lars Müller, 47, and I am a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, a position I have held for 8 years. I am writing to apply for a loan of 1213 DM to purchase a high-quality television for my home. As someone who frequently collaborates with international colleagues, I require access to current broadcasts to stay informed on global scientific developments. While I do not currently hold a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with 620 DM for the past 15 months. I have a stable income, reside in my own home, and have consistently repaid my existing bank credit for a car installment plan. With one dependent and a registered foreign worker under my name, I prioritize financial responsibility. I kindly request your approval based on my punctual repayment history and secure employment.  

Sincerely,  
Lars Müller

Dear Bank Officer,  

I am Thomas Weber, 47, a certified electrician employed at ElektroHans GmbH since 2016. I seek a 1213 DM loan to acquire a television for my household, as my current device is nonfunctional. I have no checking account but hold savings bonds worth 750 DM. My 7-year tenure at ElektroHans, combined with my 3-year residency in my current apartment, demonstrates stability. I have fully repaid prior credits and manage a monthly installment plan for store purchases. With one dependent and a life insurance policy, I am committed to timely repayments. My telephone number is listed for easy contact. I assure you of my reliability and appreciate your consideration.  

Yours faithfully,
