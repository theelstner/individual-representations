Okay, I need to create five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the provided profile. Each letter must come from a different person, so I have to invent specific instances for each generic attribute. Let me start by breaking down the profile to understand the requirements.

First, the profile has several key elements:
- Existing checking account: 0 to less than 200 DM, duration 18 months.
- Credit history: critical account or other credits not at this bank.
- Purpose: business-related.
- Credit amount: 3590 DM.
- Savings account/bonds: less than 100 DM.
- Present employment: unemployed.
- Installment rate: 3.
- Personal status: male, married/widowed.
- No other debtors or guarantors.
- Residence since 3 years.
- Property: car or other.
- Age: 40.
- No other installment plans.
- Housing: own.
- Number of existing credits at this bank: 3.
- Job: unemployed/unskilled/non-resident.
- Dependents: 2.
- Telephone: yes.
- Foreign worker: registered under the customer's name.

Each letter needs to address why the person is applying for the loan, their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. The challenge is to make each person unique while fitting the profile. Let me brainstorm different scenarios.

First person: Maybe a former employee who was laid off but has a business idea. Let's say he's a former mechanic. He could be starting a repair shop. He has a car as property and a critical credit history from previous loans.

Second person: Perhaps someone who was self-employed but had to stop due to health issues. Now, they want to start a small catering business. They have a car and some savings, but not much. They have dependents and need the loan to get back on track.

Third person: Maybe a foreign worker who came to work in the country, has been unemployed recently, and wants to start a food stall. They have a critical credit history from their home country but are now registered here. They own a car and have a stable residence.

Fourth person: Could be a former teacher who lost their job due to school closures. They want to start an online tutoring service. They have a car and some existing credits at the bank. They need funds for equipment and marketing.

Fifth person: Maybe someone who was working in construction but got injured, leading to unemployment. They want to start a home improvement blog and sell DIY kits. They have a car and a critical credit history from previous attempts.

Now, I need to make sure each letter includes specific details from the profile. For example, each must mention being unemployed, having dependents, owning a car, existing credits at the bank, etc. Also, they need to explain why they are trustworthy—maybe through their past responsibilities, stable residence, or commitment to repay.

I need to avoid generic terms. Instead of "skilled employee," use specific jobs like "mechanic," "teacher," etc. Each letter should have a unique business purpose and personal story. Also, ensure the letters are concise, not too long, and properly ended with a sign-off.

Let me start drafting each letter one by one, making sure they all fit the profile and have distinct scenarios. Check for each attribute in the profile to ensure compliance. Also, ensure that the loan purpose is business-related and that the financial situation is explained clearly, including their current unemployment but plans to generate income through the new business.

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Thomas Reinhardt, a 40-year-old registered foreign worker currently unemployed. I have been residing in this city for three years and own a checking account for 18 months with a small balance due to recent job loss. I am applying for a 3,590 DM loan to launch a mobile car repair service, leveraging my 12 years of experience as a mechanic in my home country. Despite my current unemployment, I have three existing credits with this bank, all in good standing, and own a van I can use for business. My wife and two children rely on me, and this venture will provide stable income. I assure timely repayments with the 3% installment rate, as I have maintained my residence and phone service without interruption. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely  
Thomas Reinhardt

Dear Bank Manager  

I am Karl Meier, a 40-year-old widower with two dependents, currently seeking employment after a health issue forced me to leave my job as a caterer. I have a critical credit history from a previous loan in another country but have since paid off 80% of it. My 3,590 DM loan request aims to start a small catering business here, using my professional kitchen skills. I own a delivery van and have resided in my current home for three years. Though unemployed now, I have secured two event contracts pending equipment upgrades. My savings are minimal (<100 DM), but I am committed to repayment, as evidenced by my three existing credits with this bank. I ask for your trust in my ability to rebuild.  

Respectfully  
Karl Meier

Dear Bank Manager  

As a 40-year-old registered foreign worker, I am Mohamed Ali, formerly a construction laborer now unemployed due to visa processing delays. I have lived in this city for three years and own a motorcycle. I seek a 3,590 DM loan to open a halal food stall, capitalizing on my 10 years of experience managing street food in my home country. My checking account has a low balance, but I have consistently paid my housing installments and kept my phone active. I have three existing credits with this bank, all current, and a critical credit history from a previous loan in my home country. This business will support my wife and son, and I pledge to repay the loan with the 3% rate as agreed. Thank you for your support.  

Yours faithfully  
Mohamed Ali

Dear Bank Manager  

I am Hans Weber, a 40-year-old former high school teacher, now unemployed after school closures due to economic downturns. Married with two children, I own a car and have resided in my home for three years. I request a 3,590 DM loan to launch an online tutoring platform, using my 15 years of teaching experience. My savings are exhausted (<100 DM), and my checking account reflects this due to recent unemployment. I have three existing credits with this bank, all managed responsibly, and a critical credit history from a personal loan taken during my teaching career. This venture will generate income swiftly, allowing me to meet the 3% installment terms. I guarantee repayment through my commitment and stable housing.  

Kind regards  
Hans Weber

Dear Bank Manager  

My name is Peter Fischer, a 40-year-old registered foreign worker and former construction worker, now unemployed after an injury. I have lived in this area for three years, own a motorcycle, and hold three existing credits with this bank. I am applying for a 3,590 DM loan to create a DIY home improvement blog and sell kits, using my technical skills. My checking account balance is low due to medical expenses, and my savings are minimal. Though my credit history is critical from previous loans in my home country, I have paid all local debts on time. This business will support my wife and daughter, and I am confident in repaying the 3% installments with the steady income this project will generate. I appreciate your confidence in my proposal.  

Sincerely  
Peter Fischer
