Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile says the person doesn't have a checking account. They've been in their current job for 1 to 4 years. Their job is listed as "unskilled - resident," but they are a foreign worker. The purpose of the loan is a new car, and the amount is 640 DM. They have existing credits paid back duly, a savings account under 100 DM, and own real estate. They are male, divorced, have one dependent, live in their own house, and have been in their residence for 2 years. No telephone, no other installment plans, no debtors/guarantors.

Wait, the job says "unskilled - resident," but the example in the prompt said "scientific research assistant" as a specific instance. Hmm, maybe I need to think of specific jobs that are unskilled but for residents. Maybe something like warehouse worker, manual laborer, or maybe a cleaner? Since they are a foreign worker, maybe they have a job that's manual.

Also, the profile mentions "unskilled - resident," so maybe they are a resident worker in an unskilled position. Let me think of different roles. Maybe construction worker, delivery driver, maintenance worker, etc. Each letter should have a different person with a different job and specific details.

Each letter needs to explain why they're applying for the loan (car purchase), their financial situation (current job, existing credits paid, real estate ownership), and why they're trustworthy. They don't have a checking account, so maybe they use another banking method? But the bank might need an account, but the profile says they don't have one yet. Maybe they're applying to open one? Or maybe they have a different type of account. Since they have a savings account with less than 100 DM, perhaps they use a savings account for their finances.

They are divorced, have one dependent. Maybe they have a child or a parent they support. They own real estate, which is a good credit point. They have been in their current job for, say, 2 years (since it's between 1-4 years). Let me pick specific numbers for each person: maybe 2, 3, 1.5, 2.5, etc. Also, the duration in months is 12, so maybe they've been employed for 12 months? Wait, the profile says "Duration in month:12" but "Present employment since:1 <= ... <4 years." Maybe the 12 months refers to the duration of the loan? Wait, the user might have mixed up the terms. Let me check again.

Original profile: "Duration in month:12" probably refers to how long they've had their current residence (Present residence since:2 years, which is 24 months), but the profile says "Duration in month:12"—maybe that's a separate field. Wait, the user provided the profile as:

Status of existing checking account: no checking account
Duration in month:12
Credit history: existing credits paid back duly till now
Purpose: car (new),
Credit amount: 640,
Savings account/bonds: <100 DM
Present employment since: 1 <= ... <4 years
Installment rate:4
Personal status and sex: male: divorced/separated
Other debtors / guarantors: none
Present residence since:2
Property: real estate
Age:49
Other installment plans:none
Housing: own
Number of existing credits at this bank:1
Job: unskilled - resident
Dependents:1
Telephone:none
Foreign worker:yes

So "Duration in month:12"—probably refers to the duration of employment? Or maybe the duration of the existing credit? Wait, the "Present employment since: 1 <= ... <4 years"—so the person has been in their current job between 1 to 4 years. The "Duration in month:12" might be another parameter, maybe the loan duration? But the credit amount is 640 DM. Maybe it's the duration of the existing credit? But the user hasn't specified. Since the user wants specific instances, maybe "Duration in month:12" can be converted into a specific time frame. For example, if the person has had a previous credit for 12 months. But since the credit history says existing credits paid back duly, maybe they had a credit for 12 months. But perhaps I should focus on the main profile elements.

Each letter needs to be from a different person. Let me think of five different unskilled jobs for foreign workers. Let's say:

1. Construction worker
2. Warehouse laborer
3. Janitorial supervisor
4. Delivery driver
5. Agricultural worker

Each person is a foreign worker, male, divorced, 49 years old, owns real estate, has a dependent, no checking account, but savings under 100 DM, current job for 1-4 years, existing credit paid back.

For each letter, they need to explain their situation. Let me start with the first one.

First person: Construction worker, has been employed for 2 years, owns a house, wants a car for commuting. Since he's a foreign worker, maybe he needs a reliable car to get to work. His savings are low, but he has real estate. He has paid back previous credits. He's divorced with one child. No telephone, but that's okay.

Second person: Warehouse laborer, been in job 3 years. Maybe he needs a car to transport goods or for work requirements. He has a stable job, owns property, and has a good credit history.

Third person: Janitorial supervisor. Maybe he needs a car to manage multiple sites. Has been in job 1.5 years, owns real estate. His previous credit was a loan for tools, which he paid back.

Fourth person: Delivery driver. He needs a new car to replace an old one. Has been driving for 2.5 years. Owns a house. Has a dependent.

Fifth person: Agricultural worker. Needs a car for farm duties. Has been working on a farm for 3 years. Owns land as property.

Each letter should mention their specific job, duration in current job, ownership of real estate, existing credit history, purpose of the loan (car), and why they're trustworthy (stable job, property as collateral, responsible with past credits).

Also, they don't have a checking account, so maybe they mention that they have been saving through a savings account, even though it's small. Since they are applying for a loan, perhaps they are opening a checking account with the bank.

I need to make sure each letter is unique in the specifics but fits the profile. Avoid generic terms. Use specific numbers where possible. For example, instead of saying "several years," say "two years."

Now, draft each letter step by step.

First letter:

Name: Mr. Ahmed Hassan
Job: Construction Worker
Employment duration: 2 years
Residence: 2 years
Dependent: son
Previous credit: tools loan
Loan purpose: reliable transportation to work sites

Second letter:

Name: Mr. Rajesh Kumar
Job: Warehouse Laborer
Employment: 3 years
Owns a small apartment
Need car for work shifts

Third letter:

Name: Mr. Carlos Mendes
Job: Janitorial Supervisor
Employment: 1.5 years
Previous credit for cleaning supplies
Need car to manage multiple sites

Fourth letter:

Name: Mr. James Okoro
Job: Delivery Driver
Employment: 2.5 years
Needs new car for deliveries
Owns a house

Fifth letter:

Name: Mr. Tran Van Minh
Job: Agricultural Worker
Employment: 3 years
Owns farmland
Needs car for transporting produce

Each letter should start with the bank's address, date, subject, then the body explaining their situation, and a polite closing.

Make sure each letter is concise, doesn't cut off, and properly ends with contact info and signature.

Check for any formatting issues, but the user said not to use any formatting. So just plain text with line breaks.

Now, write each letter with these specifics.

Subject: Application for New Car Loan  

Dear Sir/Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 640 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a construction worker employed at Al-Mustafa Builders for the past two years, I require reliable transportation to commute between job sites. I currently own a small apartment in Duisburg and have paid back a previous loan for safety equipment in full. Though I do not yet have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with 85 DM and have consistently met my monthly obligations. My stable income, combined with property ownership, ensures I can manage this loan responsibly. I am confident in my ability to repay the installment rate of 4 DM monthly. Thank you for considering my application.

Dear Bank Manager,  

I seek a 640 DM loan to purchase a car essential for my role as a warehouse laborer at LogiStar GmbH, where I have worked for three years.
