Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person with specific instances of the generic attributes. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile mentions a foreign worker, male, single, 37 years old, living in his own housing, has a savings account less than 100 DM, has a checking account with 0-200 DM, has a credit history of paying back previous credits, currently employed for 1-4 years, has one existing credit at the bank, job is unskilled resident, dependents: 1, no telephone, and the purpose is furniture/equipment for 1922 DM.

I need to create five different people with specific jobs instead of "unskilled resident." Let me think of different unskilled jobs. Maybe construction worker, warehouse helper, factory worker, maintenance technician, and janitor. Each person will have a unique situation but fit the profile.

Each letter should explain why they need the loan (furniture/equipment), their financial situation, and why they're trustworthy. They should mention their stable employment, existing credit paid back, and other details from the profile. Also, they have a dependent, so maybe a child or elderly relative.

Let me outline each person:

1. Construction worker: Maybe needs furniture for a new apartment after a promotion. Emphasize steady income and previous credit responsibility.

2. Warehouse helper: Perhaps needs equipment for a home office, since he works remotely part-time. Highlight punctual payments and savings.

3. Factory worker: Applying for furniture due to wear and tear. Mention the building society savings agreement as collateral.

4. Maintenance technician: Needs tools for his job. Stress the short installment rate and stable residence.

5. Janitor: Upgrading furniture for comfort. Emphasize being a foreign worker with stable employment and no other debts.

I need to make sure each letter includes specific numbers from the profile: 8 years of credit history (but existing credit duration is 12 months?), wait, the profile says "Credit history: existing credits paid back duly till now" and "Duration in month:12". Wait, the duration in month is 12, which is 1 year. But the credit history says existing credits paid back duly till now. Maybe the person has a history of managing credits, but the current existing credit at the bank is 1, with duration since 12 months.

Also, present employment since 1 <= ... <4 years, so maybe 2.5 years, or 3 years. Age 37, single, with one dependent. Let me make sure each letter has these specifics.

Let me start drafting each letter, making sure they are concise, include all required elements, and are properly ended without formatting.

Dear Sir or Madam  

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, a 37-year-old Egyptian construction worker residing in Germany for the past four years. I am applying for a loan of 1,922 DM to purchase new furniture for my apartment, as my current set is damaged from frequent moves. I have held my checking account for 12 months with a balance between 0 and 200 DM, and my savings amount to 80 DM. I have consistently repaid my previous credit for a power tool set over 18 months. Employed at a local construction site since 2021, I earn a stable monthly income and support my 8-year-old son. Though my savings are modest, I have a building society savings agreement and own my residence. I request this loan to improve my living conditions and assure timely repayment given my reliable work history.  

Sincerely  
Ahmed Mohamed

Dear Bank Representative  

I am Karim Nasser, a 37-year-old warehouse helper employed at a logistics company since March 2022. I seek a 1,922 DM loan to buy a ergonomic desk and chair to manage my work-from-home hours more comfortably. My checking account has been active for 11 months, and I have fully repaid a prior 1,200 DM loan for household appliances. My savings account holds 50 DM, but I maintain a life insurance policy as collateral. I have lived at my current address for two years and am the sole provider for my elderly mother. With no other debts and a steady income, I am confident in my ability to meet the 4% installment rate. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully  
Karim Nasser

Dear Sir or Madam  

As a 37-year-old factory worker at a textile plant since 2020, I am writing to request a 1,922 DM loan for new kitchen equipment. My current appliances are outdated and inefficient. I have a 12-month checking account with 150 DM and a savings bond worth 90 DM. Over the past eight years, I have paid all credits on time, including a 2,000 DM loan for my sister’s education. I reside in my own apartment and have a building society savings agreement. Supporting my 6-year-old daughter, I prioritize financial responsibility. My employer confirms my stable income, and I assure you of punctual repayments. This loan will enhance my productivity and household well-being.  

Sincerely

Dear Bank Officer  

My name is Youssef Ramadan, a 37-year-old maintenance technician employed at a manufacturing plant since 2021. I require 1,922 DM to replace my broken heating system, which is critical during winter.

This loan will ensure my family’s comfort and safety. I commit to honoring all terms with diligence.  

Gratefully
