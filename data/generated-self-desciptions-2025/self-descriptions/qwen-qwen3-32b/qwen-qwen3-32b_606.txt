Okay, I need to write five motivation letters for a bank loan application based on the given profile. Each letter should be from a different person. Let me start by understanding the profile details.

First, the profile has specific attributes. Let me note them down:

- Checking account: at least 200 DM, salary assigned for at least 1 year.
- Duration in months: 10 months.
- Credit history: existing credits paid back duly.
- Purpose: furniture/equipment.
- Credit amount: 1275 DM.
- Savings account/bonds: less than 100 DM.
- Present employment since: less than 1 year.
- Installment rate: 4.
- Personal status: female, divorced/separated/married.
- No other debtors/guarantors.
- Present residence since 2 years.
- Property: building society savings agreement or life insurance.
- Age: 23.
- No other installment plans.
- Housing: own.
- Number of existing credits at this bank: 1.
- Job: skilled employee/official.
- Dependents: 1.
- No telephone.
- Foreign worker: yes.

Each letter needs to be from a different person. So, I need to create five distinct individuals with specific instances of the generic attributes. For example, instead of "skilled employee," maybe "scientific research assistant," "nurse," etc.

Let me brainstorm different jobs for each person. Let's think of five different skilled jobs or official roles. Maybe:

1. Scientific research assistant
2. Nurse
3. Office administrator
4. Electrician
5. Teacher's aide

Each person will have a unique reason for needing the loan for furniture/equipment. Let me think of specific scenarios. For example, a nurse might need a new bed for a child, an electrician might need tools, etc.

Also, each person is a female foreign worker, age 23, married/separated/divorced, with one dependent, living in their own housing for 2 years, has a building society savings agreement, no telephone, etc.

I need to make sure each letter includes why they need the loan, their financial situation (mentioning existing credit paid back, current job, checking account status), and why they're trustworthy.

Let me start drafting the first one. Let's take the scientific research assistant. She's been employed for less than a year, but has a good credit history. She needs furniture for a new apartment. She has a building society agreement. She's a foreign worker, maybe from another country, working in Germany. She's responsible, paid back previous loans, stable job.

Second letter: Nurse. Maybe she needs to buy a crib for her child. She's been in her residence for two years, has a savings agreement. Trustworthy because of her stable job and previous credit history.

Third: Office administrator. Needs office equipment for home office? Or furniture for her home. Maybe she's working remotely and needs a desk and chair. She can mention her stable employment and savings.

Fourth: Electrician. Needs tools for work. But the purpose is furniture/equipment. Maybe she needs equipment for her job. Or furniture for her family. Let me check the purpose is furniture/equipment, so maybe she's setting up a home office or needs furniture for her child.

Fifth: Teacher's aide. Needs to furnish a living room for social gatherings, or a study area for her dependent.

Each letter should be concise, not too long. Start with sender's address, date, bank address, subject, body, closing.

But the user said not to use any formatting. So no bold, italics, etc. Just plain text with line breaks.

Each letter should have specific details. Let me make sure to vary the reasons for the loan within the furniture/equipment category. Also, mention the existing credit paid back, current employment (even though less than a year), checking account status, savings agreement, etc.

Also, since they have a foreign worker status, maybe mention that they have been working in the country for some time, contributing, etc.

Let me check the profile again: existing credits paid back duly till now, so each person should mention that they have a history of repaying credits. The current loan is 1275 DM, installment rate 4. They have one existing credit at the bank.

Each letter must be unique. Let me start drafting each one step by step, ensuring all points are covered.

Subject: Loan Application for Furniture Purchase  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1275 DM to purchase essential furniture for my home. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed for 8 months and earn a stable monthly salary of 1800 DM. My current checking account, held for over a year, maintains a minimum balance of 250 DM, and I have consistently repaid my existing student loan through this bank without any delays.  

Though I relocated from Poland two years ago as a foreign worker, I have resided in my own apartment since arrival and contributed to a building society savings agreement. My husband and I have one child, and I am committed to maintaining financial responsibility. I assure you that the installment rate of 4 DM per month will be managed diligently alongside my current obligations. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
Maria Kowalska

I respectfully request a 1275 DM loan to replace outdated kitchen equipment, which is necessary for my household’s daily needs. As a registered nurse at St. Anna Hospital in Berlin, I have worked for 10 months and earn 2100 DM monthly.

I have lived in my own residence for two years and hold a life insurance policy. Though I am divorced and raising one child independently, my income ensures timely payments. I am confident in meeting the 4 DM monthly installment alongside my existing credit commitment. Thank you for your trust in my reliability.  

Yours faithfully,  
Lina Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I seek a 1275 DM loan to furnish my newly renovated living room, which will improve my family’s comfort. As an office administrator for a logistics firm in Hamburg, I have worked for 9 months and receive a salary of 1950 DM.

With one dependent and a stable income, I am confident in fulfilling the 4 DM monthly payment. I appreciate your consideration of my trustworthy financial history.  

Respectfully,
