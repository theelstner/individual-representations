Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Franz Adler, 32, a single father and quality-control chemist at Bayer Leverkusen for the past six years. My take-home pay is €2 450 and I have never missed the €200 monthly payment on my existing €5 000 renovation loan with you. I need €2 662 to add a safe new family car (a base-model Dacia Sandero) so I can drive my four-year-old daughter Klara to kindergarten and myself to early-shift work. I own my apartment outright, hold a paid-up life-insurance policy with €8 000 cash value, and have no other debts. My payroll is deposited to a payroll card, hence no checking account, but I am willing to open one immediately. The requested 48-month installment of €61 fits easily into my €600 monthly surplus. Please approve the loan; my flawless repayment record and stable employment make me a safe risk.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Navarro, I am 32, single, and I have worked as a senior refrigeration technician for Hamburg Süd for five years, earning €2 300 net. I have repaid every cent of my current €3 500 personal loan on schedule and now ask for €2 662 to buy a new Kia Picanto that will let me accept emergency call-outs along the coast. I live in my own flat, have no rent, no other dependents, and no other debts. Although I do not keep a checking account, my salary is wired to a prepaid card and I save €500 a month in cash; I will open an account today if required. The new credit would cost me €61 a month, 2.6 % of income, well below your 4 % ceiling. My spotless history and fixed employment make me a reliable borrower. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Navarro

Dear Team,  
I am Stefan Müller, 32, a certified industrial electrician at BMW’s Leipzig plant since January 2018 (6 years 4 months). I earn €2 600 net and have never been late on my present €4 000 consumer loan with your bank. I am requesting €2 662 to purchase a new VW up! so I can commute reliably when my shift starts at 5 a.m. Public transport does not run that early and car-sharing is becoming too expensive. I own my apartment, have a building-society savings contract with €9 000 assigned to it, and carry no other liabilities. My payroll is credited to a wage card, so I have not needed a checking account, but I will open one today. The proposed 48-month installment of €61 equals 2.3 % of income and leaves me a monthly surplus of €650. My steady employment, on-time payment record, and real-estake make me a low-risk customer. I appreciate your support.  
Best regards,  
Stefan Müller

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Jonas Weber, 32, a single paramedic employed by the City of Nuremberg since mid-2017. My net salary is €2 380 and I have honored every payment on my existing €3 000 holiday loan. I seek €2 662 to buy a new Hyundai i10 that will allow me to reach rural emergencies quickly; my current 18-year-old Polo is unreliable. I have lived in my own flat for three years, have no rent expense, and own a paid-up life-insurance policy worth €7 500. No other debts burden me. Although I receive pay on a card rather than a checking account, I will open one immediately. The requested 48-month installment of €61 represents 2.5 % of income and fits comfortably within my €550 monthly surplus. My proven reliability and essential-job stability make me a trustworthy borrower. Thank you for approving the loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Lending Manager,  
My name is Erik Hansen, 32, a master welder at Blohm+Voss shipyard for five years ten months, with a net income of €2 500. I have never missed the €190 monthly payment on my current €4 500 loan with your institution. I apply for €2 662 to finance a new Toyota Aygo that will get me to the dockyard by 6 a.m.; the night bus is being cancelled. I own my apartment, have no rent, and hold a building-society savings contract with €10 000. I have no other debts or dependents. My wages are paid to a card account, but I am ready to open a checking account today. The new loan’s 48-month installment of €61 equals 2.4 % of income, leaving me a surplus of €600 monthly. My flawless repayment history, skilled-trade tenure, and property stake assure you of full repayment. I look forward to your approval.  
Kind regards,  
Erik Hansen
