Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Lena Weiss, 41, senior research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Climate Physics, employed there since 2015. I need €3,868 to replace my 2009 Opel Zafira that died last month; without a car I cannot reach the coastal measurement stations. Net salary €3,250 plus €400 child benefit for my 9-year-old son. Monthly rent €680, no other loans, no checking account yet because my salary is paid to a savings-bank book that currently holds €87. Credit record shows one paid-off micro-loan for a laptop; the “critical” flag stems from a €35 phone bill I forgot while on field work—now settled. I have worked 9 years in the same position, live in the same flat for 24 months, and own only the replacement car I am about to buy. Installment of €160 over 24 months equals 4 % of disposable income, easily covered. Please approve the loan; my institute’s HR will gladly confirm permanent employment.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lena Weiss

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Marta Jelen, divorced mother of one, 41 years old, self-certified tax adviser running my own one-woman office in Bremen since 2014. My 2006 VW Transporter, essential for client visits, needs a successor; I have found a 2015 Caddy for €3,868. Average monthly profit last 3 years: €2,400; no salaries, no alimony, only €700 rent for office+flat. Savings €63, no checking account—clients pay into business savings. Schufa lists one old €2,200 consumer credit (furniture after divorce) paid on time; the “critical” marker is a €50 co-signed phone contract with my ex that he missed. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and offer the new vehicle itself as security. 24-month loan at €160/month fits easily within 4 % rule. After eight successful years in business I ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Marta Jelen

Dear Team,  
Katharina Lorenz, 41, married, senior nurse on the cardiology ward of Cologne City Hospital since 2013 (permanent contract). My husband and I separated last year; I now rent a small flat and need reliable transport for night shifts. I have chosen a 2014 Skoda Fabia priced €3,868. Gross salary €3,050, net €2,050, child benefit €219 for my daughter. Current savings €91; no checking account yet because I use my (ex) husband’s until divorce finances are final. Credit history shows only a €1,000 store loan paid off in 2021; the “critical” entry is a €60 electricity back-payment already arranged in installments. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and offer the car as collateral. €160 monthly over 24 months is 4 % of net, well within household surplus. After 9 years in the same hospital, I am a safe bet.  
Kind regards,  
Katharina Lorenz

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Selin Yilmaz, 41, Turkish citizen with unlimited German residence, married but living alone while my husband finishes his degree in Ankara. I have worked as IT project manager at SAP Berlin for 8 years (permanent contract, €4,800 net). My 2007 Ford Fiesta collapsed; I need €3,868 for a 2016 Seat Ibiza to commute 60 km daily. Savings €74, no checking account yet—salary goes to payroll card. One previous €3,000 credit card balance cleared last year; the “critical” note is a €48 unpaid streaming bill during my move—now settled. Rent €650, no dependents here, no other loans, no co-debtors. Proposed €160 monthly installment equals barely 3 % of net income. The car will be registered in my name and can serve as security. I respectfully request approval.  
Best,  
Selin Yilmaz

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Franziska Adler, 41, divorced, sole supporter of my 12-year-old daughter, employed as logistics shift-leader at Amazon Leipzig since 2014 (tariff wage €2,700 net). My 2005 Renault Clio no longer passes inspection; I have located a 2013 Peugeot 208 for €3,868. Savings account holds €52; no checking account yet because I use cash budget envelopes. Earlier credit record shows a €1,500 washing-machine loan repaid early; the “critical” flag is a €36 mobile-internet bill I disputed during Covid—paid once documented. Present residence 24 months, rent €600, no other debts, no guarantors. €160 monthly over 24 months is exactly 4 % of net, leaving €1,400 for living costs. The vehicle itself is my only property and offered as security. After 9 years with Amazon and a spotless attendance record, I ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Franziska Adler
