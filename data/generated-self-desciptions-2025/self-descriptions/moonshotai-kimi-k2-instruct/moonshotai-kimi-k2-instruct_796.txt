Letter 1 – Marco Weber, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 3,062 DM to buy a height-adjustable lab bench and an ergonomic chair so I can prepare tissue samples at home for the university pathology department, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My salary of 2,450 DM net reaches my savings-book at the local savings bank every 15th of the month; the balance is currently 780 DM. I have lived in the same 42 m² apartment on Lindenstraße for three years and pay 420 DM rent, always on time. The only other credit I carry is a 200 DM/month car loan that will be settled in November; every instalment has been paid promptly, as your records confirm. My daughter Lena is my only dependent. With no other debts and a stable employment contract that runs until 2007, I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Marco Weber  

Letter 2 – Daniel Lehmann, Railway Signal Maintainer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
After 9 years with Deutsche Bahn I need 3,062 DM to replace my broken welding unit and to buy a professional-grade tool chest so I can accept private repair jobs on weekends. My take-home pay is 2,600 DM; 650 DM goes into my savings passbook, which now holds 920 DM. I rent a small terraced house in Feldmoching for 680 DM and have never missed a payment. The proposed 4 % instalment (122 DM) fits easily within the 300 DM buffer I keep each month. My previous 1,500 DM consumer credit was paid off last year without a single reminder. I am single, 32 years old, and have no other obligations. I would appreciate your support.  
Respectfully,  
Daniel Lehmann  

Letter 3 – Philipp Hoffmann, Court Clerk  
Dear Loan Team,  
As a certified judicial clerk at the Munich District Court since 1997, I earn 2,720 DM net and have saved 840 DM. I am applying for 3,062 DM to furnish my new apartment with a solid wood desk and a document-safe filing cabinet required for confidential case files I occasionally review at home. My housing costs are 550 DM rent; the requested 122 DM monthly instalment represents only 4 % of my income. My only existing loan—taken out for my car—will be fully repaid in four months, every due date honoured. I have no property, no guarantors, and no other instalment plans. At 32, with a tenured position and one dependent son, I offer the reliability you expect.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Philipp Hoffmann  

Letter 4 – Stefan Neumann, Senior Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Loan Department,  
For the past 7 years I have prepared cytostatic drugs at the city hospital, earning 2,550 DM monthly. I need 3,062 DM to buy an air-purifying laminar-flow hood for the small preparation room I rent in my shared flat, ensuring patient safety when I compound therapies for local doctors. My savings account currently shows 690 DM, and I have no checking account by choice—only my payroll card. I pay 480 DM rent and can comfortably afford the 122 DM instalment. My record shows one prior 1,200 DM loan that I repaid early. I am single, 32, with no other debts or dependants besides my dog. I kindly request approval.  
With regards,  
Stefan Neumann  

Letter 5 – Andreas Vogel, Aviation Sheet-Metal Worker  
Dear Lending Officer,  
I have built aircraft fuselage segments at MTU Aero Engines for 8 years and take home 2,700 DM. I am seeking 3,062 DM to purchase a professional column drill and a welding table so I can start a side business crafting custom metal furniture. My savings-book balance is 860 DM, and I have consistently set aside 300 DM each month. I rent a workshop garage for 350 DM and my apartment for 500 DM; the 122 DM loan instalment equals 4 % of my net income. My only current credit is a 180 DM/month motorcycle loan that finishes in February, always paid on schedule. I am 32, single, and have no other liabilities or guarantors. Your support will help me grow responsibly.  
Thank you for your confidence.  
Best regards,  
Andreas Vogel
