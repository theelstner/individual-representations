Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Carlos Mendoza, I am 32 and have worked for the past six years as a scientific-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Leipzig. I need 2 325 DM to replace my 1991 Polo with a new Hyundai i10 so I can continue to drive my eight-year-old daughter to school and to weekend visits with her mother. My net salary is 2 100 DM and my only existing bank obligation is a 110 DM monthly installment for the computer I bought last year; together with the proposed 97 DM car payment my debt-service ratio stays below 10 %. In six years I have never missed a payment on my checking overdraft (currently –180 DM) or on the computer loan, and I have already set aside 350 DM in my savings account. The car itself will serve as additional collateral. I respectfully ask you to approve the 24-month loan; my record shows I pay what I owe.

Thank you for your consideration.

Carlos Mendoza

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Arjun Patel, 32, single, and a skilled electronics technician employed since 2013 at Siemens in Nuremberg. I am requesting 2 325 DM to purchase a new VW Up! so I can accept on-call shifts that begin at 5 a.m., something impossible with buses that start at 5:30. My take-home pay is 2 050 DM and my only current credit is a 95 DM monthly bank loan for household goods taken in 2015 and always paid on time. Adding the proposed 97 DM car installment keeps me well below the bank’s 35 % threshold. Though my checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 120 DM, I have saved 400 DM and own my apartment and current car outright. After four years of flawless repayment history with you, I ask for your continued trust.

Respectfully,

Arjun Patel

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Youssef El-Amin, 32, Syrian national and single father of a ten-year-old son. Since 2014 I have worked as a certified nursing official at the University Hospital in Cologne, earning 2 200 DM net. I need 2 325 DM to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach night shifts that public transport cannot serve. I have 480 DM in savings, own my flat, and my only debt is a 100 DM monthly bank loan taken in 2016 and never missed. My checking overdraft of 90 DM will be cleared with next week’s salary. A 24-month loan at 97 DM per month represents 4 % of income, well within safe limits. My six-year clean credit history with you shows I honor obligations; I kindly request approval once again.

Sincerely,

Youssef El-Amin

Dear Loan Department,

I am Petr Novák, 32, CNC machine operator at Bosch in Stuttgart for the past five years. I am applying for 2 325 DM to replace my failing 1993 Golf with a new Kia Picanto so I can keep my 4 a.m. shift that pays the 150 DM monthly bonus I rely on. My net income is 2 120 DM, my savings hold 420 DM, and my checking account is –150 DM only until the 25th. My sole existing credit is a 105 DM monthly bank loan for tools, always paid promptly since 2015. The new installment of 97 DM keeps total debt service at 10 % of income. After five years of perfect repayment, I respectfully ask for your approval.

Best regards,

Petr Novák

Dear Credit Manager,

My name is Kwame Asante, 32, Ghanaian national and skilled laboratory technician at Bayer in Leverkusen since 2014. I seek 2 325 DM to purchase a new Toyota Aygo so I can respond to emergency call-outs at the plant, a requirement for my promotion to team leader. My net salary is 2 180 DM, I possess 450 DM in savings, and my only current obligation is a 100 DM monthly bank loan taken in 2016 and never missed. My checking account shows –170 DM today but will be positive again on payday. The proposed 97 DM installment over 24 months equals 4.5 % of income. After six years of flawless repayment history with your bank, I trust you will view me as the reliable borrower I strive to remain.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kwame Asante
