Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Ana Petrova, a 64-year-old Ukrainian laboratory technician who has worked for the Max-Planck-Institute in Potsdam for the past eight years. My divorce became final last spring; since then I have lived alone with my 12-year-old granddaughter Katja in the small terraced house I bought after selling my former family home.  
The house is paid off, yet my checking balance is only 186 DM and my savings book holds 96 DM. I need 753 DM to replace our broken television—Katja’s only window to her school’s online lessons.  
I have never missed a payment: the 3,500 DM car loan I took with you in 2020 was repaid in 24 equal installments and closed two months ahead of schedule. My guarantor is the institute’s personnel manager, Dr. Werner Scholz, who has known me for eleven years.  
With a net salary of 1,450 DM, the proposed monthly installment of 125 DM represents less than 9 % of my income and leaves room for living costs and granddaughter care.  
I respectfully ask for your approval so that Katja can continue her schooling without further interruption.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Leyla Yilmaz, I am a 64-year-old Turkish machine setter and have been in Germany since 1987. After 31 years at the same company I still earn 1,380 DM net each month and have never been unemployed.  
My checking account currently shows 174 DM; my savings passbook holds 87 DM. I need 753 DM to buy a new kitchen radio—my only companion during long evening shifts.  
I have always repaid on time: the 2,000 DM furniture credit granted by your bank in 2019 was settled after 18 months without a single reminder. My ex-husband, Mehmet Yilmaz, who remains a close friend, acts as guarantor; he owns the apartment building in which I have lived for the past three years.  
The requested installment of 125 DM is exactly 2 % of my monthly income, well within the safe range. No other loans or obligations burden me.  
I would be grateful if you could approve this small loan so that I can continue to listen to the news that keeps me connected to both Germany and Turkey.  
With kind regards,  
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Maria Gonzalez, 64, originally from Spain, now a senior pharmacy assistant in Stuttgart. I have been employed by the same drugstore chain for the past nine years and currently earn 1,520 DM net per month.  
My divorce two years ago left me with full ownership of our condominium; however, my liquid funds are low—only 152 DM in checking and 73 DM in savings. I am requesting 753 DM to purchase a television so that my disabled sister, who recently moved in with me, can follow her rehabilitation exercises via broadcast programs.  
I have one open credit with your institution—a 1,800 DM dental loan from 2020 that matures next month and has been serviced flawlessly. My guarantor is the pharmacy owner, Frau Dr. Inge Hoffmann, who has employed me for the entire period.  
The new loan’s installment of 125 DM equals 2 % of my net income and will not interfere with household expenses or the final payments on the existing credit.  
I kindly ask for a quick approval so that my sister’s recovery is not delayed further.  
Respectfully yours,  
Maria Gonzalez

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Jana Novak, I am a 64-year-old Czech national and have worked as a certified tax clerk in a midsize Dresden accounting firm for the last eleven years. My monthly net salary is 1,340 DM; my checking balance is 167 DM and my savings account holds 54 DM.  
I am applying for 753 DM to replace my defective television, which is essential for keeping up with continuing-education broadcasts required for my professional license.  
I have one prior relationship with your bank: a 2,200 DM home-appliance loan originated in 2018 and repaid without delay; the account was closed in 2021. My guarantor is my supervisor, Steuerberaterin Ulrike Meissner, who has overseen my work for the past seven years.  
The proposed installment of 125 DM represents 2 % of my income and is the only obligation I would carry; no other installment plans exist.  
I would appreciate your approval at your earliest convenience so that I can meet my continuing-education deadline.  
Thank you very much.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jana Novak

Dear Credit Reviewer,  
I am Elisabeth “Elli” Mwangi, 64, a Kenyan-born senior ward nurse who has worked for the Klinikum Nürnberg since 1991. I became a German citizen in 1995 and have been living alone in my own row house after my separation last year.  
My checking account presently shows 143 DM; my savings balance is 68 DM. I am requesting 753 DM to buy a television for my 88-year-old mother, who has recently come to live with me and depends on German-language programs to learn the language.  
I have one active credit with your bank—a 1,500 DM laptop loan taken in 2020 that will be fully repaid this December; every installment has been debited on schedule. My guarantor is the head of nursing, Herr Dipl.-Pflegewirt Thomas Berg, who has been my line manager for twelve years.  
The new monthly installment of 125 DM equals 2 % of my net income of 1,480 DM and will not endanger household solvency. No other debts or installment commitments exist.  
I kindly request prompt approval so that my mother can feel at home in her new country.  
With sincere thanks,  
Elisabeth Mwangi
