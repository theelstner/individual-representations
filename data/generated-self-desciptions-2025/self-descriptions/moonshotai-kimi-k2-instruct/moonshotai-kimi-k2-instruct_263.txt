Letter 1 – Rosa Martínez, Radio Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 1,603 DM to replace the failing studio transmitter that keeps my small neighbourhood radio on air. For eight years I have worked as a scientific-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute, earning 2,050 DM net. My current checking balance is –85 DM because I just settled last quarter’s VAT, but my sole existing bank loan (a 5,000 DM car credit) has been paid on the dot every month since 2019. I own my apartment and a 1994 VW Golf; no other debts or dependants except my 12-year-old daughter. The new transmitter will raise our listener base and advertising income, letting me repay 67 DM monthly over 24 months without strain. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Rosa Martínez  

Letter 2 – Fatima Al-Hassan, TV Production Assistant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 1,603 DM to buy a professional colour-monitor essential for the community television workshop I run for migrant women. I have been employed as a senior laboratory technician at the municipal hospital for the past nine years and have lived at the same address for four. Although my savings book shows only 90 DM, my salary of 2,200 DM and my debt-free record (my car loan with you has never been late) guarantee the 67 DM monthly instalment. I am divorced, have one son, own my flat, and possess no other credits. The monitor will allow our group to produce programmes we can sell to local stations, securing the repayment.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Al-Hassan  

Letter 3 – Lina Petrov, Broadcast Engineer  
Dear Team,  
I am applying for 1,603 DM to purchase a digital mixing console for my home studio, from which I supply audio content to three regional stations. I am a 55-year-old foreign national, have worked as a skilled electronics technician for the city transport authority for seven years, and have lived in my own apartment since 2019. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 120 DM, but my savings passbook holds 95 DM and my only bank loan—taken for a used Opel—has been serviced flawlessly. With no other instalments or guarantors, I can comfortably meet the 67 DM monthly payment over 24 months. The console will double my output and income, ensuring timely repayment.  
Best regards,  
Lina Petrov  

Letter 4 – Amrita Singh, Radio Presenter  
Dear Madam/Sir,  
I request 1,603 DM to acquire a portable field recorder so my weekend bilingual radio programme can go live from local events, attracting new sponsors. I am a 55-year-old foreign woman, separated, with one daughter; I have owned my flat since 2019 and hold a 1995 Renault. My day job as a senior pharmacy technician at Charité Hospital has provided steady income for the past eight years. My checking account shows –50 DM today, my savings 80 DM, yet my repayment record on the 4,200 DM car loan I still have with you is spotless. No other debts exist. The 67 DM monthly instalment represents 3 % of my net salary, well below the 4 % rate you require. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Amrita Singh  

Letter 5 – Elena Costa, Satellite-TV Technician  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am seeking 1,603 DM to replace the defective satellite receiver that supplies foreign-language programmes to 300 subscriber households. I am 55, married, foreign, and have worked as a certified high-voltage technician for the power utility for ten years. I have resided in my mortgaged apartment for four years and own a 1993 Mercedes used for service calls. My checking balance is –70 DM and my savings 60 DM, but my record on the 6,000 DM equipment loan I have with you is unblemished since 2018. No other credits or dependants. The 67 DM monthly payment fits easily within my 2,300 DM net income. The new receiver will restore full service, retain customers, and secure repayment.  
Gratefully,  
Elena Costa
