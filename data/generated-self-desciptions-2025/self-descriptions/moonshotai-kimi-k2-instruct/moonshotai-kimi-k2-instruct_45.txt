1. Letter from Dr. Ing. Arjan Patel, 24, married, research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics, Garching  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 6 187 DM loan to buy a 1997 VW Golf that will let me reach the institute’s remote experimental hall for night-shift data runs. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn because I recently paid 1 800 DM for my wife’s visa extension; my savings book holds 420 DM. I have worked 5 years on fixed-term contracts, renewed every 18 months, and my net salary is 2 450 DM. Rent and utilities take 650 DM, leaving enough room for the requested 206 DM monthly installment. Although I still service two smaller credits (total 140 DM/month) taken before I joined your bank, every payment has been met on the due date. My residence permit is tied to uninterrupted employment; defaulting would endanger both career and stay, so I have every incentive to remain solvent. The car itself will serve as additional collateral. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Arjan Patel  

2. Letter from Herr Mehmet Yildiz, 24, married, certified welder at BMW Leipzig  
Dear Loan Department,  
I need 6 187 DM to replace my 12-year-old Opel with a 1998 Passat so I can keep the early shift that pays 150 DM bonus. My checking account shows –80 DM after a 500 DM remittance to my ill mother in Ankara; my savings passbook has 350 DM. I have been with BMW 6 years, earning 2 300 DM net, and live in company housing for 400 DM. The new installment of 206 DM fits easily into my 1 200 DM disposable income. Two running credits (130 DM total) have never been late; they are with another bank, but I am ready to transfer my salary to you. Losing the car would mean losing the shift bonus and, eventually, the job—something I will not risk. I appreciate your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Mehmet Yildiz  

3. Letter from Herr Piotr Lewandowski, 24, married, secondary-school mathematics teacher (Beamter auf Widerruf)  
Esteemed Bank Team,  
I request 6 187 DM to purchase a 1996 Skoda Felicia Combi necessary for the daily 70 km commute to the Gymnasium in Pfaffenhofen. My account is –95 DM after paying 650 DM for my daughter’s crèche place; my savings deposit shows 480 DM. I have served 5 years as a civil-service trainee and will be tenured next spring, when my salary rises from 2 190 DM to 2 740 DM net. The 206 DM installment equals my current phone-internet bundle—easily affordable. Two older credits (total 120 DM/month) are paid flawlessly; they predate my customer relationship with you, hence this application. As a future civil servant my dismissal is legally almost impossible, guaranteeing long-term repayment. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Piotr Lewandowski  

4. Letter from Herr Luis Ortega, 24, married, senior cook at the Hofbräuhaus Munich  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am seeking 6 187 DM to buy a 1997 Mercedes T-model that will allow me to accept lucrative catering gigs outside public-transport hours. My checking balance is –60 DM after my wife’s dental surgery (540 DM); my savings booklet holds 380 DM. I have cooked at the Hofbräuhaus 5 years, take home 2 100 DM plus average 300 DM tips, and pay 550 DM rent. The 206 DM installment represents 8 % of income—well below your guideline. I still repay two small credits (115 DM/month) punctually; they are not with you, so I now turn to you for better integration. The car is indispensable for the extra jobs that finance my family’s stay in Germany. I kindly ask for approval.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Luis Ortega  

5. Letter from Herr Viktor Rostov, 24, married, electronics technician at Deutsche Telekom, Nuremberg  
Dear Sirs,  
I apply for 6 187 DM to acquire a 1998 Ford Focus estate so I can remain on call for fibre-optic emergencies across Middle Franconia. My checking account is –110 DM after sending 600 DM for my wife’s language-course certificate; my savings account contains 460 DM. I have been employed 5 years, earn 2 380 DM net, and reside in a 470 DM flat. The requested 206 DM monthly payment fits comfortably within my 1 300 DM surplus. Two existing credits (125 DM total) have never been missed; they are held elsewhere, prompting me to consolidate my banking with you. The vehicle is mandatory for keeping the on-call bonus (150 DM) that stabilises my budget. I thank you for your favourable consideration.  
With kind regards,  
Viktor Rostov
