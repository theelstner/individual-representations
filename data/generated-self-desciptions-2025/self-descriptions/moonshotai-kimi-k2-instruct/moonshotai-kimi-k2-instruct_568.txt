Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Georg Müller, 36, a calibration technician at RheinMaschinen GmbH since 2016. My divorce last year left my checking account overdrawn, yet my 1 372 DM car loan will be repaid in 12 months at 2 % of my 3 100 DM net salary. I have never missed a payment on my existing 5 000 DM kitchen loan; the bank can verify the perfect history. I own my row-house and need the new small car to reach clients in remote plants—public transport adds two lost hours daily. My 9-year-old son is my only dependent; no other debts, no guarantors, no phone yet, but I can be reached through HR. Please approve the loan; my job is secure and a promotion to shift-leader is already signed for January.  
Respectfully,  
Georg Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Petr Nowak, Polish machinist at Stahlwerke Bochum since 2017. After separation I pay 600 DM alimony, pushing my checking account below zero, but I have always serviced my 4 200 DM furniture credit on time. The 1 372 DM will buy a 1998 Polo so I can work the late shift in Hagen—currently I lose 80 DM weekly to taxis. I rent a company flat, yet I possess a paid-off 1993 motorbike as collateral. The installment equals only 62 DM monthly, 2 % of my 3 100 DM wage. No other loans, no co-signers, one dependent daughter. Grant me this chance; my 5-year employment record and foreman’s reference prove reliability.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Nowak

Dear Team,  
I am Luis Ortega, 36, Spanish electronics assembler at Automatik AG since 2015. My divorce drained my savings below 100 DM and left the account negative, but every prior credit—total 6 800 DM—was settled early. I need 1 372 DM for a new Citroën to commute 60 km to the plant; car-pooling is unreliable and shift changes cost me 150 DM monthly in missed bonuses. I have lived in the same flat for 3 years, own my tools and a 125-cc scooter, and raise my 8-year-old daughter alone. The 2 % installment fits easily within my 2 900 DM net; no other debts exist. I ask for your trust—my supervisor will confirm my imminent step-up to team-leader.  
Thank you,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,  
Anton Ivanov here, 36, Ukrainian CNC-operator at MetTech GmbH since 2016. My checking balance is negative after court fees, yet my 5 500 DM previous loan was paid without a single delay. The 1 372 DM will complete the purchase of a new Seat Ibiza; without it I cannot accept the foreman position 45 km away starting next month. I own my 1990 Opel as trade-in and have lived in my apartment three years. The monthly debit is only 62 DM, 2 % of my 3 200 DM salary. One child depends on me; no other liabilities, no guarantors. Kindly approve—my HR letter guarantees the promotion and thus the repayment source.  
Respectfully,  
Anton Ivanov

Dear Madam,  
I write as Radu Popescu, Romanian quality inspector at Bayerische Leiterbahn since 2015. My divorce forced me to cover legal costs, leaving my account overdrawn and savings under 100 DM, but I have honoured every payment on my 6 000 DM home-appliance loan. The requested 1 372 DM will finance a new Ford Ka so I can reach the night-shift plant 35 km away; currently I spend 120 DM on late buses and forfeited shift premiums. I possess a 1992 bicycle and a small garage as property, reside at the same address for 3 years, and support only my 10-year-old son. The installment equals 2 % of my 3 050 DM income, with no other debts. Please grant the loan; my employment contract runs until 2005 and my line manager will attest to my reliability.  
Yours faithfully,  
Radu Popescu
