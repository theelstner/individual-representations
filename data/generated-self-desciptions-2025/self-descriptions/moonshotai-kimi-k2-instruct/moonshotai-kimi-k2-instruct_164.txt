Letter 1 – Klaus, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 36, single, and have worked as a laboratory technician at Westphalia Chemicals for the past six years. My take-home pay is 1 950 DM and I live rent-free in my own small row-house. I have two running credits with your bank (a 3 000 DM car loan and a 1 500 DM personal loan); both have always been paid on the 15th of every month without delay. I now need 1 262 DM to replace my 12-year-old refrigerator and washing-machine that have both failed. I have 800 DM in my savings account and can easily service the new 48-DM monthly installment from my salary. No other debts or dependents except my eight-year-old son. I have lived at the same address for three years and can be reached at the telephone registered in my name. I respectfully ask for approval so that I can keep my home running efficiently for my child. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely, Klaus Maier  

Letter 2 – Andreas, Railway Signalman  
Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Andreas Berger, 36, single father of one daughter. Since January 1994 I have held the position of signalman with Deutsche Bahn in Kassel, earning 2 100 DM net. I bought my terraced house in 1996 and have no rent to pay. Two loans already run with you: a 5 000 DM furniture loan (balance 1 800 DM) and a 2 200 DM computer loan; every installment has been met on time. I apply now for 1 262 DM to purchase a new energy-saving stove and dishwasher. My savings book shows 920 DM, so the requested 4 % rate (48 DM/month) is covered. I have no guarantors, no other installment plans, and have kept the same telephone number for five years. After 15 months of flawless repayment record I feel confident you will grant this small additional amount. Thank you very much.  
Respectfully, Andreas Berger  

Letter 3 – Martin, Aircraft Mechanic  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Martin Schulze, 36, unmarried, aircraft mechanic at Hanover Airport since 1993. My monthly income is 2 350 DM; I own my apartment and have no housing costs beyond insurance. I presently service two of your credits (3 400 DM motorcycle and 1 700 DM holiday) and have never missed a due date. I need 1 262 DM to replace a defective washer-dryer and microwave before my dependent mother moves in next month. I hold 750 DM in savings bonds and can comfortably add the 48 DM installment to my budget. No other debts, no co-borrowers, and I have been reachable at my listed telephone for four years. I kindly request the loan and pledge the same punctuality you have experienced so far.  
Best regards, Martin Schulze  

Letter 4 – Stefan, Municipal Clerk  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
My name is Stefan Lehmann, 36, single, employed as a grade-8 clerk by the City of Dresden since 1994 (salary 1 890 DM). I live in my own bungalow and have no rent expense. I currently repay two credits to your institution: 2 800 DM for home insulation and 1 600 DM for a PC, both always on time. I seek 1 262 DM to buy a new induction hob and extractor hood. My building-society savings contract shows 870 DM and my disposable income easily covers the 48 DM monthly payment. I have no other liabilities, no guarantors, and have resided at the given address for three years with a telephone in my name. I would appreciate approval so I can finish my kitchen upgrade. Thank you.  
Yours faithfully, Stefan Lehmann  

Letter 5 – Thomas, Precision Toolmaker  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am Thomas Wolf, 36, unmarried, precision toolmaker at Bosch Stuttgart since 1993 with a net wage of 2 200 DM. I own my small townhouse and have no rent. I already have two loans with you—a 4 200 DM garage loan and a 1 900 DM television loan—both serviced promptly every month for 15 months. I now apply for 1 262 DM to install a new water-saving dishwasher and tumble-dryer for my household of two (myself and my dependent brother). My savings balance is 950 DM and the proposed 48 DM installment represents less than 2 % of my income. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and have kept the same telephone number for six years. I respectfully ask for your swift approval and thank you for the trust shown so far.  
Kind regards, Thomas Wolf
