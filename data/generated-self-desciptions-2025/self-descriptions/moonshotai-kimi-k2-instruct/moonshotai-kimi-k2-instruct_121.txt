Letter 1 – Dr. Lars Meissner, junior research-group leader  
Dear loan officer,  
I am 36, divorced, and father of a 6-year-old boy. Since 2019 I have led the biotech-spectroscopy team at Fraunhofer IST; my 5-year contract was just renewed. Net salary: 3 100 DM/month, stable. I live in my own row-house in Holzminden and need a reliable car to drive to the institute’s outstation in Göttingen (140 km round-trip, 3 days/week). My 1991 Opel died in March; without a new vehicle the project deadline on 15.12. cannot be met. I ask for 2 366 DM to bridge the gap after the 1 000 DM I have already saved. My checking balance is presently 180 DM because I just paid kindergarten and roof repair. No other loans except the current 50-DM/month building-society contract with you. I have never missed a payment since opening the account three years ago. The requested 3 % installment (71 DM) equals 2.3 % of my income, well within the bank’s guideline. Please approve the loan; my scientific performance bonus next April will allow early redemption if desired.  
Respectfully, Lars Meissner  

Letter 2 – Andreas Vogel, self-employed master carpenter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 36-year-old master carpenter, divorced, one daughter (9). Since 2017 I have run my one-man workshop in Delbrück; annual profit averaged 42 000 DM. I own my house and small yard where I store timber. My 1989 Ford Transit collapsed (gearbox), paralysing deliveries. I have 800 DM in savings and need 2 366 DM to co-finance a 1996 VW Transporter (total 7 900 DM). My checking account shows 150 DM today because a customer payment (3 800 DM) will arrive next week. I have fulfilled every obligation of my 1994 building-society loan (50 DM/month) with you. The new credit would cost 71 DM/month – 2.6 % of my average net income. The vehicle secures the loan itself, and my order book is full until February. I kindly ask for approval so I can resume deliveries next Monday.  
Sincerely, Andreas Vogel  

Letter 3 – Martin Richter, deputy head of logistics, City of Bielefeld  
Dear team,  
I am 36, separated since last year, and father of a 5-year-old son who lives with me every weekend. I have worked for the City of Bielefeld since 1998, presently as deputy head of logistics (salary group 8, net 2 900 DM). My 1990 VW Golf was written off after a crash; without a car I cannot bring my son to kindergarten and reach night-shift emergencies within 30 min as required. I have 900 DM saved and apply for 2 366 DM to buy a 1996 Seat Ibiza. My checking balance is 170 DM today (salary comes in four days). My only other credit is the 50-DM building-society loan with you, always paid on time. The proposed 71-DM installment equals 2.4 % of net income. The car itself serves as security; I also own my apartment house (mortgage-free). I would appreciate a quick decision so I can resume full parental and professional duties.  
Yours faithfully, Martin Richter  

Letter 4 – Dr. Thomas Neumann, senior physician, St. Josef Hospital  
Dear loan department,  
I am 36, divorced, and father of 7-year-old twins. I have been a senior physician in cardiothoracic surgery at St. Josef Hospital since 2016, earning 4 200 DM net. My on-call duty requires a car less than ten years old; my 1991 Audi no longer meets hospital safety rules. I have 950 DM in savings and request 2 366 DM to purchase a 1997 VW Polo. My checking account shows 190 DM because I just paid property tax. Apart from the 50-DM building-society loan (with you) I have no debts; every payment has been met for the past three years. The 71-DM monthly installment represents 1.7 % of my income, well below the 20 % limit. The car is my property and collateral. Granting this loan will ensure my continued availability for emergency operations. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully, Dr. Thomas Neumann  

Letter 5 – Stefan Krause, IT project manager, Miele & Cie  
Dear Sir or Madder,  
I am 36, divorced, and raise my 8-year-old daughter alone. I have been employed by Miele & Cie as an IT project manager (SAP SD) since 2015, current net salary 3 400 DM. My workplace in Gütersloch is 38 km from home; public transport takes 90 min, incompatible with school hours. My 1989 Opel was scrapped last month. I have 850 DM saved and need 2 366 DM to co-finance a 1996 Renault Mégane. My checking balance is 160 DM today (salary day is 30.09.). My only existing credit is the 50-DM building-society loan with you, paid without delay. The requested 71 DM/month equals 2.1 % of my net income. The car itself is security; I own my terraced house. I kindly ask for approval so I can resume reliable commuting and care for my daughter.  
Sincerely, Stefan Krause
