Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Markus Hoffmann, 28, senior lab technician at BioChem Rhein GmbH for the past 6 years. My wife and I are expecting our first child in September; the used Polo we share cannot fit a rear-facing seat. I am requesting 939 DM over 12 months to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero (cash price 7 200 DM; I have 6 261 DM already). Net household income is 2 450 DM, our mortgage 610 DM, and the new installment will be 78 DM—3.2 % of income. My salary has been assigned to this bank for five consecutive years; current balance 340 DM. Although a 320 DM mobile-phone debt was reported in 2022, it was closed the same month. I own our row-house (market value 180 000 DM) and hold 750 DM in savings bonds here. No other debts, no guarantors, no prior defaults. I have repaid three small consumer loans with you (last one closed March 2023). A new car is not a luxury—it is safety for my family. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Markus Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Bayer, 28, married, father of one, and for the past 5 years I have worked as a certified electrician for Stadtwerke München. We live in our own apartment; the mortgage is paid first every month. My checking account averages 250 DM and my salary has been routed through your bank since 2018. I need 939 DM to finish paying for a new VW up! that will replace the 1998 Golf that just failed inspection. I have 6 000 DM saved and the dealer holds the car until I wire the balance. Monthly payment will be 78 DM—well below the 4 % ceiling. Savings bonds with you total 800 DM. A 450 DM furniture credit with another bank is current; no late payments. I have already repaid three previous loans with you in full. I have never asked for a deferral and I do not intend to start now. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Bayer

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Andreas Richter, 28, senior aircraft-maintenance mechanic at Hamburg Airport since 2019. My wife and I bought our flat last year; we now need a reliable car for the night shifts I work. I am applying for 939 DM to close the gap on a new Škoda Fabia priced at 8 000 DM; I have 7 061 DM in hand. My salary (2 600 DM net) has been assigned to this bank for 4 years; checking balance 290 DM. The installment of 78 DM equals 3 %. I hold 900 DM in savings bonds here and own the apartment outright. One 500 DM credit-line elsewhere is up to date; no missed payments. I have successfully repaid three prior loans with you, the last in January. I have no dependents besides my spouse, no other debts, and no history of default. I would appreciate your approval so I can collect the car before my next shift.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Richter

Dear Team,  
I write as Thomas Neumann, 28, married, father of a 3-year-old boy. I have been a civil-service clerk at the city tax office since 2018 and live in our own terraced house. My 1999 Opel died last month; repair costs exceed its value. I am short 939 DM to finalize the purchase of a new Kia Picanto listed at 7 500 DM. I have 6 561 DM saved and hold 600 DM in savings bonds with you. My net income is 2 300 DM; the new loan installment of 78 DM is 3.4 %. My salary has been credited to my checking account (current balance 220 DM) without interruption for 5 years. A 380 DM small-loan at another bank is current and will be paid off in October. I have already repaid three consumer loans with your bank, the last in 2022, never with delay. No guarantors, no other obligations. I kindly ask for your support so my family can stay mobile.  
Best regards,  
Thomas Neumann

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Christian Vogel, 28, senior refrigeration technician for Nordsee-Supermarkets for 6 years. My wife and I are expecting our second child; our 1997 Audi no longer starts reliably. I need 939 DM to complete payment on a new Hyundai i10 (cash price 8 100 DM; I have 7 161 DM plus 750 DM in savings bonds here). My checking account averages 300 DM and my salary has been assigned to you since 2018. Monthly installment will be 78 DM—3.1 % of net income (2 500 DM). I own our apartment; mortgage 550 DM, always paid first. One 400 DM credit-card balance elsewhere is current. I have repaid three previous loans with you, the last closed April 2023, without ever requesting rescheduling. No other debts, no guarantors. I respectfully request approval so I can collect the car before the baby arrives. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Christian Vogel
