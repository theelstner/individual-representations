Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Mendez, a 27-year-old veterinary-lab technician who has rented a tiny room behind the marketplace for three years. I need 3,652 DM to buy a second-hand centrifuge and microscope so I can open “Mendez Mobile Lab,” a weekend service for rural farmers. My take-home pay is 1,300 DM; my only dependent is my six-year-old daughter Ana. I have worked at Tiervet GmbH for five years and four months, and my wage slips show a steady rise. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 95 DM—proof that I live within my means. Although I still owe 1,100 DM on a computer loan from another bank, I have never missed the 55-DM monthly payment. The proposed 2 % installment rate equals 73 DM, which I can cover by cutting overtime taxi rides. The building-society contract I opened at age 22 now shows 2,400 DM, giving you additional collateral. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone—just solid work and a business plan that already has 20 farmers waiting. Please help me turn my daughter’s future secure.  
Respectfully,  
Arturo Mendez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Nowak, 27, single father of Maya (4). Since 2018 I have been a CNC operator at MetPro AG, currently earning 2,100 DM net. I request 3,652 DM to convert my late grandfather’s garage into a small side-business making custom aluminum guitar parts; purchase orders from two music shops total 5,800 DM. My checking account shows 150 DM today, savings 80 DM, yet my payslips are regular and my employment contract is open-ended. I have serviced a 900-DM motorcycle credit elsewhere without delay; the new loan’s 73-DM monthly fits easily into my 400-DM discretionary budget. I own my apartment (inherited, debt-free) and have paid into a life-insurance policy since 2019, now valued at 3,100 DM. After 5 years and 3 months with the same employer and three years at the same address, I offer stability despite my modest balances. Grant me this chance to grow.  
Sincerely,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Yusuf Hassan, Syrian machinist, resident of Bremen for three years. I am 27, single, and father to my sister’s son whom I support (1 dependent). I have worked at Hansa Precision for 6 years and 1 month, net salary 1,950 DM. I seek 3,652 DM to buy a used industrial sewing machine and start “Hassan Workwear,” supplying overalls to local factories. My checking balance is 170 DM, savings 60 DM; I send 300 DM home monthly yet keep perfect payment discipline on a 750-DM furniture loan elsewhere. The new installment of 73 DM represents 2 % of nominal income and leaves 280 DM safety margin. My life-insurance policy, begun 2017, has 2,700 DM surrender value. I possess no phone, but every supervisor since my hiring will vouch for my punctuality. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my residence is owned outright. Help me stitch a new livelihood.  
Yours faithfully,  
Yusuf Hassan

Dear Credit Committee,  
I write as Dmitri Petrov, 27, Bulgarian instrument technician at ChemLab Europe for 5 years 8 months. I need 3,652 DM to patent and prototype a low-cost pH sensor for school labs—already endorsed by two chemistry teachers’ associations. My salary is 2,050 DM; after rent to my cousin (zero, I house-sit his own flat) I live on 600 DM and save the rest. Checking: 190 DM; savings: 90 DM. I still service a 950-DM personal loan at another bank with zero arrears. The proposed 73-DM monthly installment equals 2 % and fits my 480-DM surplus. My building-society contract, started 2016, holds 2,950 DM. Three years at the same address, steady employment, single, no dependents except my project. I carry no other liabilities and offer you my future royalties as moral collateral. Please approve the loan so young students can afford good science.  
Respectfully,  
Dmitri Petrov

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Luis Ortega, 27-year-old Peruvian auto-electrician at KlimaAuto GmbH since May 2018 (5 years 5 months). I apply for 3,652 DM to buy a mobile diagnostic unit and launch weekend on-site service; 40 customers have pre-registered. My net wage is 1,800 DM; my checking account balance is 160 DM and my savings book 70 DM. I honor a 650-DM small credit at Sparkasse Nord, never late. The new 73-DM monthly payment is 2 % of the loan and only 4 % of my income, well below my 350-DM buffer. I own my small row-house (inherited, no mortgage) and have accumulated 2,600 DM in a life-insurance plan. Single, one dependent (my mother, 54, lives with me), no other debts, no co-signers, no phone bills—just reliable hands and a clear goal. Allow me to wire a brighter future.  
Kind regards,  
Luis Ortega
