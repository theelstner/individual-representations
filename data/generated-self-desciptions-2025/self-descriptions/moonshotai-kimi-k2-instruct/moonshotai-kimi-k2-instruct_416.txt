1. Letter from Dr. Larissa Müller, 35, divorced, one daughter aged 9  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for 1 381 DM to complete the purchase of a new VW Polo that will let me drive to the university hospital where I have worked as a scientific research assistant in pediatric oncology for the past three years. My salary is 2 650 DM net; housing costs are 430 DM because I own my small row-house outright. My only existing credit with you—a 3 000 DM kitchen renovation loan—has been paid on time every month since 2019. My checking account currently shows –120 DM because I just paid daycare fees, but the overdraft is covered by next week’s salary. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I carry life-insurance that names the bank as contingent collateral. A reliable car is essential for on-call emergencies; I have budgeted the 4 % installment (58 DM) without strain. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Larissa Müller

Dear Loan Officers,  
I request 1 381 DM to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can accept a guaranteed 30-hour contract as senior pharmacy technician at Stadtapotheke; the position starts 1 August and requires a car for late-shift transport. I have been employed there three years and earn 2 400 DM net. We own our apartment; the mortgage is 320 DM/month and never missed. My current checking balance is –80 DM after holiday expenses, yet my payroll clears tomorrow. My only existing loan with you—a 2 500 DM furniture credit—has been serviced perfectly since 2020. No other debts, no co-signers, and my life-insurance policy secures the new loan. The 58 DM monthly installment fits easily within the 4 % rule you apply. I would be grateful for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Maria da Silva

Dear Team,  
I need 1 381 DM to finish paying for a new Opel Corsa that lets me keep my 8 km commute to the district court where I serve as judicial clerk (Beamtenanwärterin). My net pay is 2 550 DM; I have held the post since February 2020. My checking account is –60 DM today after kindergarten charges, but salary arrives 30 June. My previous 3 200 DM computer-loan with your bank has never been late. Housing is my own terraced house; monthly costs 380 DM. I carry no other loans, no guarantors, and I have building-society savings worth 4 000 DM assigned as silent security. The proposed 58 DM installment equals 2.3 % of income—well below your 4 % ceiling. I promise the same punctuality you have already experienced.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Ines Becker  

4. Letter from Aisha Rashid, 35, divorced, one son  
Dear Sirs and Madams,  
I am asking for 1 381 DM to settle the balance on a new Fiat Panda that I need to reach my night-shift job as radiology technologist at St. Hedwig Klinik, where I have been employed since January 2020. My net wage is 2 700 DM; my checking account is overdrawn 95 DM after school-trip costs, yet my salary credits on the first of every month. My existing 2 800 DM household-appliance loan with you carries a perfect repayment record. I own my small condo; housing expense 350 DM. No other debts, no co-debtor, and my life-insurance policy can be ceded to the bank if desired. The 58 DM monthly payment represents 2.1 % of income, comfortably within your 4 % guideline. I appreciate your continued confidence.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Rashid  

5. Letter from Petra Novak, 35, married, one daughter  
Dear Loan Department,  
I apply for 1 381 DM to finalize purchase of a new Škoda Fabia required for my role as quality-control chemist at Bayer Werk Dormagen, a position I have held since April 2020. My net earnings are 2 800 DM; my current account is –70 DM after quarterly utilities, but my wage is credited on 1 July. My sole prior 3 500 DM home-improvement loan with you has been repaid flawlessly. We live in our own semi-detached house; monthly outgo 400 DM. I have no further credits, no guarantors, and my building-society contract (balance 5 200 DM) can serve as additional collateral. The requested 58 DM installment equals 2 % of income, safely below the 4 % limit. I would value your approval and guarantee the same timely payments you have received to date.  
With thanks,  
Petra Novak
