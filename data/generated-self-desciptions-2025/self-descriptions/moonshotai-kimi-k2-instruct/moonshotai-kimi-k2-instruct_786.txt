Letter 1 – Former Regional Sales Manager, now consultant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
After 32 years in medical-device sales I took early retirement at 59 to care for my diabetic ex-wife; our divorce left me with the house but only EUR 180 in my checking account.  I have kept my one existing car-loan with you paid perfectly for 20 months and never missed a cent.  A 2016 Skoda Octavia (EUR 6 468) will let me restart independent consulting; three hospitals have already signed letters of intent that will bring EUR 2 100 net per month.  The house is debt-free, my only dependent is my 25-year-old son who finishes his apprenticeship in July, and I have no other debts.  At 60 I still have six strong earning years ahead; please allow me to add this second, modest loan to the one I have already honoured.  
Respectfully,  
Klaus Müller

Letter 2 – Self-employed master carpenter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have run my one-man carpentry workshop for 28 years, but since a back operation last spring I can no longer lift heavy beams on site.  My checking balance is EUR 150 today, yet every instalment of my current EUR 5 000 equipment-loan has been transferred on the 30th of each month for 20 months without fail.  A used 2015 Caddy (EUR 6 468) would let me deliver finished furniture instead of building on location, keeping turnover at EUR 3 200 per month.  I own my house outright, have no other debts, and my 17-year-old daughter, my only dependent, will start an apprenticeship in August, cutting my expenses.  I ask for 20 months of support so I can keep paying every bill on time until 66.  
With thanks,  
Franz Huber

Letter 3 – Freelance software architect  
Dear Team,  
At 60 I am the oldest coder in my co-working space; after my divorce I live alone in my own flat and keep EUR 170 in checking.  For 20 months I have serviced my first EUR 4 500 laptop-loan flawlessly.  A reliable 2014 VW Golf (EUR 6 468) will let me reach clients in Stuttgart and Munich; I already have signed contracts worth EUR 18 000 for the next quarter.  No other debts, no guarantors, and my 19-year-old daughter just moved into her own apartment, so my only outgoing is this single new loan.  Twenty months of identical instalments will close it before I reach statutory retirement.  
Best regards,  
Dr. Thomas Lechner

Letter 4 – Interim hospital administrator  
Dear Lending Department,  
Following restructuring at Augsburg General I accepted severance last year; since then I have worked as an external interim manager for two rural hospitals, paid per diem.  My checking account holds EUR 190, but my record with you shows 20 consecutive on-time payments on an earlier renovation-loan.  A 2013 BMW 318d (EUR 6 468) is essential to cover the 450 km weekly commute; the board of Klinikum Bad Tölz has already extended my contract through December.  I own my condominium debt-free, have no other instalments, and support only my 22-year-old son until he graduates this summer.  Permit me to add this one small loan to the clean history I have built with you.  
Sincerely,  
Martin Baumgartner

Letter 5 – Self-employed scientific translator  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I translate research papers from English and French; after my divorce I kept the terraced house and currently keep EUR 160 in my checking.  My sole existing loan—taken to replace the heating—has been repaid exactly on schedule for 20 months.  A 2015 Renault Megane (EUR 6 468) will let me meet publishers in Heidelberg and Frankfurt, protecting my monthly net income of EUR 1 850.  I have no other debts, no co-signers, and my 24-year-old daughter finishes her master’s in October, ending child support.  I respectfully request a second, equally modest loan that will be fully repaid within 20 months, just before my 62nd birthday.  
Yours faithfully,  
Peter Neumann
