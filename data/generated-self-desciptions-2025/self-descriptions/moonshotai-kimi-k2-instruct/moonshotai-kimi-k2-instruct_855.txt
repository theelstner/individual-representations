Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 1,442 DM to buy a new 1990 VW Polo so I can keep my night-shift job as a hospital porter in Cologne. I have worked there for five years and my contract runs until 1993. My take-home pay is 2,300 DM and my only monthly costs are 350 DM child support for my two daughters and 200 DM food; I live rent-free in my mother’s flat. My last two small loans from your bank—800 DM and 1,200 DM—were both repaid early. Although my checking balance is currently –120 DM, my salary next week will restore it to positive. I have no other debts, no rent, and I am asking for only 4 % of my income as the monthly installment. I have never missed a payment in Germany and I intend to keep that record. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Dumitru Lupu

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Ahmed Hassan, 32, Egyptian mechanic at Ford-Werke since January 1988. I need 1,442 DM to replace my broken 1982 Kadett with a new Fiesta so I can continue to commute to the plant in Niehl. My net wage is 2,400 DM, I live free in the company hostel, and I send 400 DM monthly to my wife and two small children in Cairo. I have already repaid two earlier loans from your branch—1,000 DM and 1,500 DM—without a single delay. My checking account shows –80 DM today because I just paid kindergarten fees; my salary on the 30th will zero that. I ask for 4 % installment, no other credits anywhere, and I offer you my wage assignment as security. I have been in Germany six years without one day unemployed. Please approve the loan; my family’s mobility depends on it.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Team,  
I am Petar Ivić, 32, unskilled warehouseman at Obi-Baumarkt, employed since March 1987. I request 1,442 DM for a new Dacia 1210; my old Wartburg died last week and I must drive my disabled brother to dialysis three times a week. My salary is 2,200 DM net, I live free in my uncle’s house in Leverkusen, and my only expense is 300 DM household money. Your bank knows me: I repaid 900 DM and 1,100 DM loans ahead of schedule. My account is –60 DM today after buying winter tires; next salary will cover it. I offer 4 % installment, no rent, no other debts, and I have been at the same address for four years. A reliable car is medical necessity, not luxury. Thank you for helping me keep my word to my brother.  
Sincerely,  
Petar Ivić

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is José da Silva, Brazilian, 32, assembly-line worker at Bayer for six years. I need 1,442 DM to buy a new Opel Corsa so I can travel to weekend Portuguese-language courses in Düsseldorf and qualify for promotion next year. My net income is 2,500 DM, I live free in the parish guesthouse, and I save 300 DM monthly; my passbook shows 95 DM today. I have already honored two previous loans from your bank—1,000 DM and 1,300 DM—finishing the last one six months early. My checking account is –40 DM because I just paid for my mother’s visa; my salary tomorrow will clear it. I request 4 % installment, no rent, no other credits, and I have lived at the same address since 1987. Education is my only debt, and I always repay.  
Obrigado,  
José da Silva

Dear Madam,  
I am Marian Nowak, 32, Polish citizen, unskilled packer at Aldi since April 1986. I apply for 1,442 DM to purchase a new Fiat Uno; my current 1981 Lada is unsafe for my newborn twins. My wage is 2,100 DM net, I live free in my sister’s flat in Duisburg, and I spend 250 DM on diapers and food. I have repaid two prior loans from your branch—700 DM and 1,000 DM—never missing a mark. My checking balance is –95 DM after buying baby car-seats; my salary on the 1st will restore it. I ask for 4 % installment, no rent, no other debts, and I have been in the same apartment for four years. Fatherhood taught me responsibility; I will not let you down.  
With respect,  
Marian Nowak
