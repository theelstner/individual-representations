Letter 1 – Carlos Mendoza, Automotive Mechanic  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 35, single, and have worked as a senior transmission specialist at QuickShift Garage for the past six years. I need €8,858 to buy a 2018 diesel van so I can start my own mobile-repair service on weekends. My take-home pay is €2,100 and my only fixed cost is €350 rent to my mother; I have lived with her for one year and pay no utilities. Although my checking account was closed after an overdraft in 2020, I have since repaid the €1,240 debt and can document the clearance letter. I have no other loans, no dependents beyond my ten-year-old daughter, and I am prepared to let the bank debit the €370 monthly installment directly from my wages. The van will raise my side income enough to keep the payment below 18 % of net earnings. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendoza  

Letter 2 – Dr. Lars Nielsen, Post-doctoral Researcher  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 35-year-old Danish biophysicist employed on a fixed-term contract at the Max-Planck Institute since 2019. I must purchase a reliable used car (€8,858) to commute between the Hamburg and Kiel laboratories three times a week. My net salary is €3,050; housing is supplied by the institute, so my largest expense is childcare for my six-year-old son (€280). Although my German checking account was cancelled after a brief negative balance during my relocation, my Danish account remains positive and I have arranged for salary transfers to your bank. Savings are modest because I moved countries, but my employment is guaranteed until 2027 and the requested installment of €370 represents only 12 % of income. I carry no other debt and can offer a direct-payroll guarantee. I would be grateful for your support.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Lars Nielsen  

Letter 3 – Amir Hassan, Restaurant Head Chef  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am 35, single, and have led the kitchen of “Levantine Nights” for five consecutive years. I need €8,858 to replace my failing 2005 compact with a 2017 used hatchback so I can reach the morning wholesale market before service. My contractual salary is €2,300 net, supplemented by an average €400 in tips declared to tax authorities. I live rent-free in the apartment above the restaurant, moving in only thirteen months ago after my divorce. My prior checking account was closed for unpaid fees during that divorce, but I have since settled every cent and can provide the bank’s closure certificate. No other credits or dependents burden me; the proposed €370 monthly payment equals 13 % of income and will be secured via direct wage assignment. I respectfully ask for approval so I can keep the restaurant supplied and growing.  
Kind regards,  
Amir Hassan  

Letter 4 – Viktor Petrov, Wind-turbine Service Technician  
Dear Lending Team,  
Age 35, I have spent the last six years climbing 120-metre turbines for NordWind Services and have just signed a new three-year contract. To reach remote coastal sites I must buy a four-wheel-drive vehicle costing €8,858. My net monthly income is €2,450; housing is provided in a shared technicians’ lodge, so my only regular cost is sending €300 home to my mother. My former checking account was closed after currency-transfer issues when I arrived from Latvia, but I have cleared the small negative balance and possess the confirmation letter. I have no property, no other loans, and no dependents in Germany. The €370 installment equals 15 % of salary and will be automatically transferred by payroll. I respectfully request your approval to keep Germany’s turbines—and my career—running smoothly.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Viktor Petrov  

Letter 5 – Elias Schwarz, Certified Electrician & Foreman  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am a 35-year-old master electrician employed by Stadtwerke München since early 2019, currently supervising fifteen apprentices. My daughter Lisa (12) lives with me on weekends; we reside in my late grandmother’s house for which I pay only property tax (€180) and utilities. My take-home pay is €2,600 and I have no rent. I need €8,858 for a 2019 estate car to transport tools and Lisa safely. My checking account was terminated after an identity-theft incident in 2021; I have since repaid the €967 shortfall and hold the bank’s clearance notice. No other debts, no other installment plans, and no guarantors are involved. The requested €370 monthly debit equals 14 % of income and can be backed by a wage-assignment order. I kindly ask for your consent so I can continue training the next generation of electricians while caring for my family.  
With appreciation,  
Elias Schwarz
