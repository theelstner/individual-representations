My name is Emre Yilmaz, I am 23 years old and I have lived in Cologne for two years. I work as an unskilled warehouse assistant at KölnFresh GmbH and have been there for three years. My monthly net income is 1 100 DM and I live in my own small one-room apartment which I inherited from my grandmother. I am applying for a loan of 2 520 DM to buy a television and a stereo system so that my six-year-old son can watch educational programmes and I can improve my German with the radio courses. I already have two small loans with this bank which I have always serviced on time; the instalment rate of 4 % is easy for me to manage. I have 700 DM in a savings account and a building-society savings contract with 1 500 DM in it as security. My checking account currently shows 150 DM, but my salary comes in regularly and no other debts or guarantors burden me. I have never broken a payment promise in Germany and I will not start with your bank. Thank you very much for your trust.

I am Anton Petrov, 23, single, Russian, resident in Duisburg since 2021. For two and a half years I have been working as an unskilled loader for LogiTex AG, earning 1 050 DM net. I need 2 520 DM to buy a television and a receiver so that my mother, who lives with me and speaks no German, can watch Russian news and stay mentally stable. My checking balance is 180 DM, but every month 50 DM goes into my savings book which now holds 800 DM. I also have a life-insurance policy with 2 000 DM surrender value. Two running credits with you are almost paid off; I have never missed an instalment. The new loan would cost 42 DM a month, 4 % of my disposable income. I have no other debts, no guarantors and I have never moved since arriving in Germany. I respectfully ask for approval.

With due respect, I, Luis Ortega, 23, unmarried, Spanish, apply for 2 520 DM. I have been living in my own small row house in Oberhausen for two years and working for the city’s street-cleaning department for three years, earning 1 020 DM net. My checking account shows 120 DM today, but my savings account holds 900 DM and my building-society contract another 1 800 DM. I need the loan for a television and a DVB-T receiver so that my four-year-old daughter can watch German cartoons and learn the language before school. I already service two small loans with you; the proposed instalment of 4 % fits easily into my budget. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone, just reliability. I will continue to pay conscientiously and I thank you for your support.
