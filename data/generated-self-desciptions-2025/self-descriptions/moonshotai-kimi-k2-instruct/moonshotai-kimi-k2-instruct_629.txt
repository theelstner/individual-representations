Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 1 437 DM to buy a new 1985 Opel Kadett that will let me reach the Max-Planck-Institute in Garching where I have worked as a scientific research assistant for the past 5 years and 8 months. My net salary is 1 950 DM; my checking balance is 186 DM and my savings book holds 420 DM. The only credit I have ever taken from this bank—750 DM for a washing machine—was repaid in 18 punctual installments. I live rent-free in the small row-house I inherited from my grandmother and have been in it for 3 years; there are no co-debtors, no other loans, and my 6-year-old son is my only dependent. With 2 % of my income the new installment is 39 DM, leaving 1 550 DM for living costs and savings. My residence permit runs until 1990 and the institute has already issued my contract extension through 1988. I respectfully ask for approval so I can keep my job and my son safe.  
Sincerely,  
Andrzej Kowalski

Dear Loan Officer,  
I have driven 53 000 km this year as a senior courier for DHL and need 1 437 DM to replace my failing moped with a new 1985 Honda C70 so parcels reach customers on time. I have been with the company 6 years 2 months and earn 1 880 DM net. My checking account shows 154 DM, my savings passbook 380 DM, and my only previous loan from this bank—600 DM for furniture—was repaid without delay. I rent a 45 m² attic room in Moosach for 280 DM, have lived there 3 years, and have no property, no co-debtors, and no other installments. The requested 2 % installment of 38 DM leaves 1 550 DM for rent, food, and support of my 8-year-old daughter. My work contract is unlimited and my residence permit is valid until 1989. I kindly request your approval.  
With thanks,  
Miguel Silva

Dear Loan Officer,  
Since 1980 I have served as a certified orthopedic technician at the Agnes-Karl-Krankenhaus; after 5 years 4 months my monthly net is 2 010 DM. I am requesting 1 437 DM to buy a new 1985 VW Polo so I can reach patients in rural areas on call-outs. My checking balance is 192 DM, my savings account 450 DM, and my only prior credit with you—900 DM for tools—was repaid early. I own no real estate, live in my late parents’ small house in Allach for which I pay only utilities, and have no other debts or dependents except my dog. The 2 % installment equals 40 DM, leaving 1 970 DM for all living costs. My residence permit runs to 1990 and the hospital has already issued my confirmation of employment through 1988. Please approve the loan so I can continue my work.  
Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrović

Dear Loan Officer,  
I have spent the last 5 years 9 months as a refrigeration technician for the Bavarian State Brewery, maintaining 4 °C fermentation tanks; my net wage is 1 910 DM. I need 1 437 DM to purchase a new 1985 Ford Fiesta so I can accept standby shifts that begin at 4 a.m. My checking account holds 178 DM and my savings book 410 DM. The single loan I have ever taken from this bank—650 DM for a welding machine—was settled on schedule. I rent a 38 m² city-owned flat in Pasing for 320 DM, have lived there 3 years, and have no property, no co-debtors, and no other loans. The 2 % installment of 38 DM leaves 1 550 DM for rent, food, and the monthly 200 DM I send to support my mother abroad. My residence permit is valid until 1989 and my employer has just renewed my contract indefinitely. I respectfully request your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Karel Novák

Dear Loan Officer,  
Since February 1981 I have worked as a quality-control chemist at Süd-Chemie AG, earning 2 050 DM net; my shift starts at 5:30 a.m. and public transport does not run early enough. I therefore apply for 1 437 DM to buy a new 1985 Renault 5. My checking balance is 165 DM and my savings account 480 DM. My only previous credit with this bank—700 DM for laboratory instruments—was repaid exactly as agreed. I live in a 50 m² cooperative apartment in Freimann that I own shares in, have resided there 3 years, and have no other property, no co-debtors, and no dependents besides my 7-year-old son. The proposed 2 % installment is 41 DM, leaving 1 550 DM for all household expenses. My residence permit is secured until 1990 and the company has provided a letter confirming my permanent position. I kindly ask for your favorable decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lev Rebrov
