Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Silva, a 20-year-old Brazilian veterinary-assistant trainee who arrived in Germany twelve months ago. I live with my three-year-old daughter in a small rented flat in Cologne. Since January I have been employed full-time at the Tierklinik Ehrenfeld, earning €1,550 net; the clinic has already promised me a permanent contract starting in October. I have paid every instalment of my current €2,000 bank loan on time and have no other debts. The €4,675 I now request will buy a 2015 VW Polo I have test-driven; it will cut my two-hour commute to the clinic to 25 minutes and let me reach night emergencies reliably. I budget €310 per month for the loan repayment, well within my disposable income of €550. Please help me secure my daughter’s future and my career.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Petrova, a 20-year-old Ukrainian laboratory technician who has rented the same studio in Leipzig since 2019. After finishing my apprenticeship in May I was hired by BioLab Services GmbH on a one-year probation that converts to unlimited employment if I keep perfect attendance; my supervisor has already issued a letter confirming the intention to retain me. I have one running credit with your bank—every €95 instalment has been debited punctually. The €4,675 will finance a 2016 Skoda Fabia Combi I need to reach pharmaceutical sampling sites outside public-transport hours; without it I risk losing the upcoming permanent position. My net salary is €1,640 and my only dependent is my retired mother who lives abroad and receives her own pension. I have no telephone contract yet, but I can be reached instantly via e-mail and will supply any document you request.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Petrova

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Fatima Al-Hassan, 20, a Syrian divorced mother of a two-year-old boy. I have lived in the same Hamburg apartment for four years and work as an ophthalmic-assistant trainee at the University Eye Clinic, earning €1,480 net. Although I have been in this job for only eight months, my department head has written a letter stating that my contract will be extended and upgraded to skilled staff in December. I have never missed the €90 monthly payment on my existing €2,500 loan with your bank. I need €4,675 to purchase a 2014 Opel Corsa so I can take my son to daycare and still reach the clinic by 6 a.m.; otherwise I will lose the post. I have no savings account yet, but I attach a detailed budget showing €380 free cash after rent and living costs—ample to service the new credit.  
Yours faithfully,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Mei Tan, a 20-year-old Malaysian married woman who moved to Stuttgart twelve months ago after marrying a German national. I am completing my apprenticeship as a biological-research assistant at the Institute for Cell Biology; my stipend is €1,510 net and the institute has guaranteed written employment for at least three years once I finish in November. My husband and I rent a small flat; we own no property except our 2010 Renault Twingo which now needs replacement after its engine failed. The €4,675 will cover a 2015 Seat Ibiza inspected yesterday; it will allow me to commute to the institute and my husband to reach evening shifts. Our only existing credit with your bank has been repaid flawlessly at €100 per month. We have no other debts and can comfortably afford the proposed €315 instalment.  
Respectfully yours,  
Mei Tan

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Elena Dragomir, a 20-year-old Romanian separated mother of one five-year-old daughter. I have resided in the same Frankfurt flat since 2019 and have worked since March as a skilled pharmacy technician at City-Apotheke, where my net wage is €1,530. My employer has already informed me that my limited contract will be converted to an open-ended one in January provided I maintain reliability; a letter confirming this is enclosed. I have never missed the €85 instalment on my current €2,200 loan. I am requesting €4,675 to buy a 2014 Ford Fiesta I have reserved; it is essential for reaching the pharmacy’s early-morning and late-evening shifts that buses do not serve. My budget shows €370 available each month after rent and expenses, more than enough for the €315 repayment. I have no telephone landline but respond immediately to e-mails and can visit the branch any afternoon.  
Thank you for helping me build a secure life for my daughter.  
Sincerely,  
Elena Dragomir
