Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 40, a single father and foreign national who has lived in Germany for 22 months. I work as a senior laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH, a position I have held for 8 years. I am requesting €2,675 to replace our broken television and radio—my 12-year-old daughter uses them daily for school assignments and language practice. My net salary is €2,100 and my only current credit with your bank has been paid on time every month. I own my small row house (no mortgage) and a 2013 Golf that is fully paid. Savings stand at €700. With no other debts and a clean Schufa record, I will comfortably service the €89 monthly installment. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Rajiv Malhotra, 40, an Indian electronics specialist employed since 2014 by Siemens Mobility in Krefeld. After 22 months in Germany I need €2,675 for a television and DAB+ radio so I can follow technical training broadcasts required for my upcoming Meister examination. My wages are €2,450 net; my existing €3,000 car loan with you carries a perfect repayment history. I have saved €850, live in my own terraced house, and drive a 2015 Caddy that serves as both property and transport. The proposed €89 monthly installment equals 3 % of my income, leaving ample room for living costs and my 8-year-old son. No other liabilities exist. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Rajiv Malhotra

Dear Team,  
My name is Petr Novák, Czech citizen, 40, single, residing in Dresden for 22 months. I have worked as a CNC programmer at Aerospace Parts Dresden for 9 years, earning €2,300 net. I apply for €2,675 to buy a smart TV and studio monitors so I can host online coding workshops for apprentices. My record: one current loan with you—always paid by the 5th, savings balance €920, no checking account needed as salary lands in my Sparkasse savings book. I own my apartment (no rent) and a 2012 Transporter. The €89 monthly rate is 3 % of income and fits easily within my budget. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Petr Novák

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Erdal Yılmaz, Turkish machinist, 40, employed at Bielefeld Textile Machines since 2011. After 22 months in Germany I request €2,675 for a television and radio to stay informed in Turkish and German—vital for integration courses I teach voluntarily. My net pay is €2,180; my only existing loan with you has never been late. I have €750 in savings, own my small bungalow, and possess a 2014 Opel Zafira. The €89 installment represents 3 % of income and is easily manageable with no other debts. I kindly ask for approval.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Erdal Yılmaz

Dear Madam,  
My name is Andrei Popescu, 40, Romanian maintenance foreman at BASF Schwarzheide since 2010. I have lived in Germany 22 months and need €2,675 for a television and radio—my elderly mother who recently joined me speaks only Romanian and relies on these for news and cultural programs. My salary is €2,350 net; my current loan with you is paid promptly each month. I hold €900 in savings, own my modest house, and keep a 2013 Skoda Octavia. The proposed €89 installment equals 3 % of income and leaves room for myself and my dependent mother. No further obligations exist. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Andrei Popescu
