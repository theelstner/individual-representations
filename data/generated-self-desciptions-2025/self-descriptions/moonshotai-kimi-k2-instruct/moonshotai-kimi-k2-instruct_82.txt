Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Marta Erlen, 44, senior cytology technician at Westbridge Pathology Lab. 18 months ago I bought a small house for my daughter and me; the move left me without savings, but I have never missed the €247 monthly payment on my two existing car and furniture loans with your bank. I now need €5 943 to replace our broken television and to buy a sturdy kitchen radio so my 12-year-old can follow her on-line classes without sharing my work laptop. My net salary is €2 140 and my fixed costs are only rent-free ownership expenses, so the requested single installment of €247 is 11 % of income. My contract is open-ended and my supervisor Dr. Reis has confirmed in writing that my position is permanent. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I am prepared to let the bank collect the installment directly from payroll. Please allow me to give my daughter the stable study environment she deserves.  
Respectfully,  
Marta Erlen

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lena Nowak, 44, divorced mother of one, employed since ten months as a certified court stenographer at the Regional Court. After my divorce I had to open a new current account; it still shows no balance because every euro goes to rebuilding our life. I have, however, serviced two previous loans—one for the car, one for the washing machine—without a single delay, as your records confirm. My daughter’s only entertainment is the family television, which has now failed completely; I therefore apply for €5 943 to purchase a modest replacement set and a small DAB radio for her homework. My net income is €2 050, housing is cost-free since the house is mine, and the requested single installment of €247 equals 12 %. I enclose the court’s letter stating my employment is civil-service permanent. I have no other obligations and I agree to salary assignment. I ask for your trust so that my child can continue her education without further disruption.  
Sincerely,  
Lena Nowak

Dear Team,  
My name is Sofia Carvalho, 44, married, mother of one boy, working as a senior radiation-safety technician at Lisbon Oncology Centre. We moved into our own row house exactly one year ago; the savings were consumed by notary fees, leaving us without reserves but also without rent to pay. I have two running loans with your branch—both paid impeccably—and I now request €5 943 to buy a reliable television and radio so my husband, who is still learning Portuguese, can follow daily news and language courses. My open-ended contract brings home €2 200 net; the single installment of €247 is 11 %. I hold no other debts, no co-signers, and I authorise direct debit from my salary account. Kindly approve this last step toward integrating my family into our new country.  
Thank you,  
Sofia Carvalho

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Petra Müller, 44, separated, employed since nine months as a master baker supervising the night shift at “GoldKrume” bakery. Although my checking account is newly opened and shows no accumulated balance, I have honoured every payment on my two existing loans with you. My 14-year-old daughter and I live in our own terraced house; the car is my only other possession. I apply for €5 943 to replace our defective television and to buy a kitchen radio so she can listen to educational programmes while I work late shifts. My net wage is €2 030; the single installment of €247 represents 12 %. I have no other credits, no guarantors, and I consent to wage garnishment if ever necessary. Please help me secure a normal home life for my teenager.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Müller

Dear Madam, Sir,  
My name is Claire Dubois, 44, divorced mother of one daughter, senior pharmacy technician at Hôpital Central. I have resided in my own small bungalow for exactly one year; the purchase drained my savings, but I own the property outright and keep a modest car. I have two active loans with your bank, both serviced promptly every month, and I now seek €5 943 to acquire a television and a radio—basic tools my child needs for homework and for keeping in touch with the world while I work rotating shifts. My permanent contract yields €2 100 net; the requested single installment of €247 equals 11 % of income. I carry no other debts, I have no co-debtors, and I am willing to sign a direct-debit mandate. I respectfully ask for approval so that my daughter’s education need not suffer further after our family changes.  
Respectfully yours,  
Claire Dubois
