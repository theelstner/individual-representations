Letter 1 – Marco Weber, 30, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting a €2,002 car loan to replace my 1998 Golf that died last month. As a scientific research assistant at Fraunhofer Institute for the past 6 years I net €1,450 monthly. My checking balance is €180 and my savings contract holds €90, yet every prior obligation—including the €3,500 personal loan I took with you in 2020—has been paid exactly on the 15th of each month. The new car will let me reach the lab’s night-shift rotas that begin in August, safeguarding the job that supports my two school-age children. Rent and utilities are €520; the requested 36-month installment of €59 fits easily within the €200 monthly surplus I have after all household costs. No other debts or guarantors exist. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached at the listed landline. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Marco Weber  

Letter 2 – Daniel Richter, 30, Railway Signal Maintainer  
Dear Loan Department,  
My current checking account shows €150 and my home-savings contract €70, but my payment record is unblemished: the €4,000 kitchen loan I repaid to you finished last spring without a single delay. I need €2,002 to co-finance a new Dacia Sandero so I can accept rotating night shifts 40 km away; overtime pay will rise by roughly €200 a month, more than covering the €59 installment over 12 months. Employed by Deutsche Bahn since January 2018, I earn €1,520 net, rent a €480 flat, and support two dependents. No other credits or guarantors are registered. I have been at my present residence for four years and can always be reached on the listed phone. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely, Daniel Richter  

Letter 3 – Lukas Hoffmann, 30, Tax Inspector  
Dear Team,  
I write to secure €2,002 for a new vehicle. My 12-year-old Opel failed inspection, and public transport will not reach the rural courts I audit. Since joining the Bavarian Tax Office in June 2017 I have risen to grade A9, netting €1,600 monthly. My checking balance is €190, savings contract €85, and my only prior loan—€5,000 taken in 2019—was settled ahead of schedule. The proposed 36-month installment of €59 represents 3 % of net income, well below the 25 % threshold. I rent for €500, have no other debts, and am single with two children for whom I pay €250 support. Residence and phone have been stable for four years. I kindly request your approval.  
Yours faithfully, Lukas Hoffmann  

Letter 4 – Felix Neumann, 30, Precision Machinist  
Dear Bank Officers,  
I am applying for €2,002 to purchase a new Citroën C3 needed for my upcoming promotion to field-service engineer. I have worked at Starrag GmbH since March 2018, currently earning €1,550 net. My checking account holds €170 and my life-insurance savings €80; the €3,800 CNC-course loan I concluded with you in 2021 shows perfect repayment history. The car will add €300 monthly travel premium to my wage, easily covering the €59 installment. Rent is €460, no other credits or guarantors exist, and I have lived at the listed address and phone for four years. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards, Felix Neumann  

Letter 5 – Jonas Braun, 30, Court Bailiff  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I seek a €2,002 loan to buy a new Kia Picanto required by my employer’s new rotating courthouse assignments. Employed as a civil-service bailiff since August 2017, I earn €1,540 net. My checking balance is €160, my building-savings contract €95, and my record with you is spotless: a €4,500 relocation loan was paid off last year without arrears. The 36-month installment of €59 fits within my €210 monthly surplus after rent (€470) and support for two children. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have resided at the same telephone number and address for four years. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Kind regards, Jonas Braun
