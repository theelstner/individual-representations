Letter 1 – Dragan Petrović, Field-Service Ultrasound Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I service hospital imaging equipment across Bavaria and need €1 979 to replace my van’s broken radio-communication and navigation unit; without it I cannot receive emergency call-outs. I have worked for Siemens Healthineers for 8 years, earn a net €2 600 monthly, and have always repaid my current €4 000 equipment loan on time. Single, I live in my own flat in Augsburg for the past two years and have no other debts. Though I keep no separate savings account, my salary is deposited directly to my payroll card; the requested installment of €79 is only 3 % of my income. I am a Serbian citizen with permanent German residency and a clean Schufa record. Granting this loan will keep life-saving devices running; I will be grateful for your trust.  
Respectfully, Dragan Petrović

Letter 2 – Luis Ortega, Veterinary Anaesthesia Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I request €1 979 to purchase a silent television for my home recovery kennel; the animals I foster after surgery need calm visual stimulation to heal. For 9 years I have been employed at the Tierklinik Stuttgart, earning €2 450 net. My only existing credit—€5 000 for surgical tools—has been paid flawlessly. I own my small terraced house in Degerloch since 2022 and keep no other installment plans. The €79 monthly payment equals 3.2 % of my salary, well below the 4 % rate you allow. Though I hold no savings book, my pay slip shows regular surplus. As a single Spanish citizen with permanent EU status and no telephone, I answer emails daily and will provide any further proof of reliability you require. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely, Luis Ortega

Letter 3 – Miroslav Horvat, Railway Signalling Engineer  
Dear Credit Committee,  
My 15-year-old car radio died, and I need €1 979 to install a compliant digital receiver so I can monitor live dispatch updates during on-call shifts for Deutsche Bahn. I have worked in signalling maintenance since 2016 and take home €2 750 monthly. My only current obligation is a €6 000 training loan, paid promptly every month. I have lived in my own apartment in Leipzig for two years and carry no other debts. The requested installment is €79, 2.9 % of my net income. While I possess no savings account, my salary deposits are transparent via payroll sheets. I am a single Croatian citizen with settled status and a clear credit record. I respectfully ask for approval so I can remain reachable for emergency track repairs.  
Yours faithfully, Miroslav Horvat

Letter 4 – Viktor László, Brewery Quality-Control Chemist  
Dear Loan Manager,  
I am seeking €1 979 to replace my defective television that doubles as a reference monitor for colour-accuracy tests at home. Employed as QC chemist at Hofbräuhaus München for 7 years, I earn €2 500 net per month. My existing €3 500 car loan has never been late. I own my Munich flat and have no dependents beyond my dog. The €79 installment represents 3.2 % of my income. Though I hold no savings account, my salary lands in a prepaid card with remaining balance visible. As a single Hungarian citizen with permanent residence and a spotless credit history, I guarantee punctual repayment and appreciate your support.  
Best regards, Viktor László

Letter 5 – Arjan van der Berg, Wind-Turbine Blade Technician  
Dear Team,  
To stay updated on weather warnings while on offshore assignments, I urgently need €1 979 for a marine-rated television set for my accommodation container. I have maintained turbines for RWE Renewables the past 10 years, with a net wage of €2 700. My only credit, a €5 500 gear-loan, is paid dutifully each month. I reside in my own Emden apartment for two years and have no other installment commitments. The €79 monthly payment is 2.9 % of my income. While I operate without a savings account, my steady surplus is documented via pay slips. A single Dutch national with German residency and a clean credit file, I respectfully request approval to keep renewable energy flowing safely. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards, Arjan van der Berg
