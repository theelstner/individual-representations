Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 1 537 DM loan to replace my broken television set. I have worked as a senior laboratory technician at Westphalia Chemicals for the past 8 years and my net salary is 2 400 DM monthly. Although my checking balance is currently 180 DM, my wages arrive reliably every 15th of the month and my only other obligations are two small credits with your bank totaling 110 DM per month. My single-family house is debt-free and my brother has agreed to serve as guarantor. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached at 0231-78943. Please approve the 4 % installment loan; repayment over 15 months is easily covered by my stable income.  
Respectfully,  
Martin Behringer

Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 1 537 DM to purchase a new radio-television combination for my mother who lives with me. Since 1990 I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the City Institute of Public Health, earning 2 550 DM net. My checking account shows 190 DM today because I just paid the annual property tax on my own home; nevertheless my job is permanent and my salary sufficient to service the requested 4 % installment. Two minor credits totaling 95 DM are already serviced by you and will be finished next spring. My cousin has signed as guarantor and I have no other debts. At age 50 with one dependent and a paid-off house I am a safe borrower. Kindly grant the loan for 15 months.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Reinhard Vogt

Dear Team,  
I am requesting 1 537 DM to buy a television set for my household. I have served as a police sergeant in Dortmund for the last 11 years, currently netting 2 700 DM per month. My checking balance reads 150 DM because I just settled quarterly utilities; savings are not held at a bank but in cash at home. My property is a terraced house owned outright, and my older sister has signed as guarantor. The proposed 4 % installment over 15 months fits easily within my budget alongside the two existing small credits (118 DM total) already managed by your bank. I have resided at Kirchstrasse 14 for four years and can be contacted at 0234-55512. Please approve the loan; repayment is secure.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Richter

Dear Sirs,  
I wish to borrow 1 537 DM to replace my defective television. Since 1989 I have worked as a certified electrical foreman at Stadtwerke München, bringing home 2 650 DM monthly. My checking account presently holds 170 DM, yet my employment is unlimited and my wage sufficient. I own my apartment building, live in one unit, and my brother-in-law acts as guarantor. Two minor running credits with your bank absorb 102 DM monthly and will be cleared next year. No other installment plans exist. At 50 years of age, single with one teenage son, I offer reliable collateral and steady income. Grant me the 15-month loan at 4 %; all payments will be met on schedule.  
Yours faithfully,  
Heinz Wiesner

Dear Credit Department,  
I am seeking 1 537 DM to purchase a radio-television set for my residence. For the past 10 years I have been a senior clerk at the Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden, earning 2 500 DM net. My checking balance is 160 DM today after monthly housekeeping, but my salary is constant and my job tenure secure. I possess a mortgage-free condominium, and my best friend has signed as guarantor. Two small credits totaling 105 DM are already administered by you and never missed. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached at 0611-987654. Kindly approve the 4 % installment loan for 15 months; repayment is fully assured.  
Respectfully yours,  
Gerhard Steinle
