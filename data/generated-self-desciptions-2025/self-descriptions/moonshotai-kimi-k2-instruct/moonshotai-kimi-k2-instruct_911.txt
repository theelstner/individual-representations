1. Letter from Maria Alvarez, Hospital Laundry Worker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 3 195 DM to buy a new 1990 Ford Fiesta so I can reach the city hospital by 5 a.m. for my laundry shift. I earn 1 580 DM net each month and have worked there 2 years 4 months. My only bank obligation is the 150 DM monthly mortgage on the small apartment I kept after my divorce; it has always been paid on time. I have no telephone, but the ward supervisor will confirm my reliability. I live with my 8-year-old daughter and need the car because the night bus no longer runs after my shift ends. My checking balance is 165 DM today, yet I have never missed a payment on the 1 200 DM furniture loan I took here in 1988. I can comfortably add 120 DM a month for the car note. Please allow me to keep providing for my child and my job.  
Respectfully,  
Maria Alvarez

2. Letter from Fatima El-Amir, Bakery Packer  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I pack flatbread at BackWerk GmbH since 1 May 1988 and make 1 450 DM net. I ask for 3 195 DM to replace my broken Trabant with a new Dacia, so I can continue the 35 km commute. I am divorced and support my 5-year-old son; we own our tiny row-house inherited from my parents. My only debt is the current home-loan of 140 DM per month, paid flawlessly. My checking account holds 180 DM, but my payroll is steady and my shift supervisor, Herr Becker, will vouch for me. I have no phone, yet I can be reached through the bakery. I have never failed the bank, and I will not start now. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima El-Amir

3. Letter from Jolanta Nowak, Supermarket Cleaner  
To the Credit Department,  
I clean at Aldi from 4 a.m. to 10 a.m. for 1 390 DM net and have done so since 3 March 1989. I need 3 195 DM for a new Opel Corsa; without it I will lose the job when winter buses fail. I divorced last year; my 11-year-old daughter and I live in our own small brick house, worth little but fully ours. I have no savings book, only 120 DM in checking, yet every prior loan (one, 1 000 DM for a stove) was repaid early. My installment rate is 1, so 110 DM monthly fits my budget. I carry no other debts and have no guarantor problems. Please approve the loan; my employer will confirm my punctuality.  
Gratefully,  
Jolanta Nowak

4. Letter from Samira Haddad, Vegetable Market Porter  
Dear Bank Team,  
I load produce at the Grossmarkt since 15 August 1988, earning 1 510 DM net. I seek 3 195 DM for a new Fiat Uno to drive my daughter to school before work and to keep my 3 a.m. shift. I am separated; my ex-husband left me the cottage we bought together, and I keep the mortgage of 125 DM current every month. My checking balance reads 150 DM, but my pay is regular and my foreman, Herr Schulze, will speak for me. I have one closed loan here (900 DM for a fridge) paid without fault. I have no phone, no other debts, and can manage 115 DM monthly for 28 months. I ask for your help to secure our future.  
Respectfully,  
Samira Haddad

5. Letter from Nguyen Thi Lan, Electronics Factory Assembly Assistant  
Esteemed Lenders,  
I assemble circuit boards at TelTech since 12 June 1989, making 1 620 DM net. I apply for 3 195 DM to buy a new Nissan Micra so I can reach the plant at 5:30 a.m. and collect my 7-year-old daughter evenings. My husband and I divorced last year; I kept the terraced house and continue its 130 DM monthly loan to your bank without delay. My checking account shows 170 DM today, yet my employment record is spotless and my line manager, Frau Richter, will confirm. I have no savings booklet, no phone, and no other credits. I can comfortably pay 120 DM each month. Please grant me this chance to stay reliable for my child and my employer.  
Yours faithfully,  
Nguyen Thi Lan
