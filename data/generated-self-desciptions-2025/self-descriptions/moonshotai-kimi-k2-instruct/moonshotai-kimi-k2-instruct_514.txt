Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Franz Adler, 26, a single father and laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig since 2018. My salary (€1 950) is assigned to your bank and my current account has held €220 for the past 14 months. I have repaid my first €1 500 car loan on time every month and now need €2 687 to buy a used PCR machine so I can offer freelance water-quality testing on weekends. My building-society contract (€7 400) serves as silent security; rent and living costs leave me €390 free cash, so the €179 instalment (2 % of loan) is easily covered. No other debts, no guarantors, one dependent. Please help me turn my side business into extra income for my daughter’s schooling.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Lukas Meier, 26, unmarried, and I have worked as a certified refrigeration engineer at Kältebau Süd for 5 years 3 months. My pay (€2 100) flows into my ≥200 DM account at your branch and I have never missed the €112 payment on my existing €3 000 equipment loan. I request €2 687 to buy a portable welding unit and a van roof rack so I can accept after-hours service calls; this will raise my monthly net by roughly €350. Savings stand at €90, but my life-insurance policy (€12 000) is fully paid up. Rent, utilities and support for my mother leave €460 disposable income, comfortably covering the €179 instalment. No other liabilities, no co-signers. I have lived at the same address for 4 years and can be reached by phone anytime.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Lukas Meier

Dear Team,  
I am Jonas Weber, 26, single, and a senior pharmacy technician at Stadtapotheke Rosenheim since January 2019 (5 years 4 months). My salary (€2 040) is assigned to you and my account has stayed above €210 for 16 consecutive months. I have just finished repaying a €2 200 holiday loan without a single delay and now seek €2 687 to purchase professional pill-counting and blister-packaging machines to start a small repackaging service for local care homes. My building-society savings contract shows €8 100; cash savings are €85. After rent, health insurance and support for my younger brother, I retain €420 monthly, so the €179 loan instalment (2 % rate) fits easily. No other debts, no co-debtors, telephone listed.  
Kind regards,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Tim Hoffmann, 26, single, and a court-certified judicial clerk at Amtsgericht Aachen since April 2019 (5 years 1 month). My wage (€2 200) is deposited at your bank and my account balance has exceeded €230 for the past 13 months. I have honoured every payment on my previous €2 800 furniture loan and now apply for €2 687 to acquire a high-speed document scanner and law-book licences for my private legal-research service aimed start-ups. My life-insurance policy (€15 000) is assigned to me; liquid savings are €70. Rent, utilities and alimony for my son leave €450 free, so the €179 instalment is only 40 % of available cash. No other instalment plans, no guarantors, telephone registered.  
Yours faithfully,  
Tim Hoffmann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Felix Braun, 26, unmarried, and I have served as a CNC machinist at Metallbau Stark for 6 years 7 months. My salary (€2 150) is transferred to my ≥200 DM account at your institute and I have never missed the €105 payment on my €2 400 motorcycle loan. I request €2 687 to buy a desktop CNC mill and raw-aluminium stock to produce custom drone parts, a niche that already earns me €250 monthly in pre-orders. My building-society savings total €9 200; cash savings are €95. After rent, health insurance and support for my sister I have €430 disposable, so the €179 instalment is safe. No other credits, no co-signers, resident at the same flat for 4 years, telephone listed.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Felix Braun
