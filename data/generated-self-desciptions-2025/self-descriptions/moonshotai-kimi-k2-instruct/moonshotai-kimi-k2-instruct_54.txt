Letter 1 – Javier, laboratory technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1,262 € to replace the broken radio-communication console in our neighborhood emergency-watch centre in Valencia. For the past three years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Polytechnic, earning 1,180 € net each month. My only bank account is the twelve-month-old loan I have with you, which I have repaid punctually every 30 days. I live in the studio apartment I inherited; I own no property beyond my 2009 Seat Ibiza valued at 900 € and 85 € in savings. The proposed installment of 3 % of my income fits easily within my budget, since I support only my younger brother and carry no other debt. I have been registered at the same address for two years and can supply employer confirmation that my contract runs until 2026. Thank you for considering this small, short-term loan; my record with you shows I honour obligations.  
Respectfully,  
Javier Molina

Letter 2 – Dmitri, line cook  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 1,262 € to buy professional knives and a small television for the staff room of the restaurant I will help open in Hamburg next month. I arrived from Ukraine eighteen months ago and have worked continuously as a skilled grill chef, currently earning 1,350 €. The only credit I have ever taken is the one I opened with you twelve months ago; every payment has been made on the exact due date. I rent a room in a shared flat, have lived there for two years, and possess nothing except my 2010 Opel Corsa. My savings book holds 72 €. The new loan’s installment equals three percent of my net wage, well below the thirty-percent limit my chef contract allows. No other debts or dependents burden me. Granting this loan will let me keep my job and continue flawless repayment.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Kovalenko

Letter 3 – Arjun, warehouse supervisor  
Dear Loan Team,  
I am applying for 1,262 € to purchase a television and PA system for the community cricket club I coach after work in Darmstadt. Since arriving from India two years ago I have been employed as a logistics coordinator at Schenker AG, a position I have held for three years with a gross salary of 2,050 €. The twelve-month consumer loan I maintain with your bank has been settled early every month. I own a 2008 VW Polo and have 93 € in my savings account; my rented room has been my home for twenty-four months. The requested installment represents three percent of my disposable income, leaving ample margin for living costs and the support I send to my mother. No other credits or guarantors encumber me. My repayment history and stable employment make me a reliable borrower.  
Kind regards,  
Arjun Mehta

Letter 4 – Mateo, automotive painter  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I write to secure 1,262 € to replace the old analogue television that keeps the workers informed during breaks at my uncle’s body-shop in Stuttgart. I came from Paraguay two years ago and have worked since then as a certified car painter, currently earning 1,280 € net. The personal loan I opened with you twelve months ago has been serviced without a single delay. I live in a small studio I bought on mortgage-free terms two years ago; my only asset besides the flat is my 2011 Ford Fiesta and 60 € in savings. The monthly installment amounts to three percent of my salary, well within the limit my union considers safe. I have no dependents, no other loans, and no checking account elsewhere. My steady job and perfect repayment record speak for my reliability.  
Yours faithfully,  
Mateo Giménez

Letter 5 – Yusuf, wind-turbine technician  
Dear Lending Department,  
I request 1,262 € to buy a weather-proof radio and smart television for the offshore service platform where I work as a mechanical maintenance technician near Bremerhaven. I have been in Germany for two years and have spent the last three years with the same energy company, earning 2,200 € gross. The twelve-month consumer loan I maintain with you has been repaid on schedule every month. I reside in a company-owned container apartment onshore and have been registered at that address for two years; my 2010 Renault Clio and 95 € savings constitute my entire wealth. The proposed installment equals three percent of my net income, leaving comfortable room for living costs while I support my wife abroad. No other debts or guarantors exist. My flawless payment history and technical tenure assure you of full repayment.  
Respectfully yours,  
Yusuf Al-Khalil
