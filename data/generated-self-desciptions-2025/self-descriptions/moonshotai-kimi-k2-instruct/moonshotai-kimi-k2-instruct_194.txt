Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 36, single father of two primary-school children. I drive a 2012 VW Caddy that doubles as the delivery van for the micro-roastery I started 27 months ago. After two years of steady growth I have just signed a supply contract with three cafés in Regensburg; the 3 915 DM loan will buy a second-hand 5 kg drum roaster so I can triple weekly output. My only existing bank credit—taken out 20 months ago for the first roaster—has been repaid early every month. I have been a scientific-research assistant at the university hospital for the past three years (net 2 450 DM) and live in my own small row house; no other debts, no guarantors, no missed payments. My checking balance is 180 DM today because I pre-paid green-bean stock; savings are 90 DM. With 4 % of disposable income the new installment fits easily inside the family budget. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can meet the cafés’ demand and secure my children’s future.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Martin Hoffmann, 36, certified refrigeration technician and single. Since 2018 I have run “CoolCall”, a one-man repair service that keeps supermarket coolers running in and around Nuremberg. My 27-month track record shows 12 % annual profit growth; the 3 915 DM loan will buy a used compressor-testing unit that lets me certify systems on-site and win larger maintenance contracts. I have repaid my only previous bank loan—a 2 000 DM vehicle loan—without a single delay. Present net salary averages 2 300 DM; housing costs are 320 DM because I own my small terraced house. Checking account: 150 DM; savings: 70 DM. The new 4 % installment leaves comfortable margin for my two dependents (my mother and my nephew who live with me). No other debts, no co-borrowers, telephone listed. I have lived at the same address for two years and my van is my only property. I ask for your support to expand my business and create one additional apprenticeship next year.  
Respectfully,  
Martin Hoffmann

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Sebastian Richter, 36, and I have spent the last eight years as a police-department radio-equipment technician. After hours I run “BikeLight”, a side-business building road-legal LED kits for touring bicycles. Sales have doubled each season; the 3 915 DM loan will finance injection-moulding tools so I can move assembly from my kitchen table to a small workshop. My only existing bank credit (taken 22 months ago for a CNC router) shows 100 % on-time repayment. I earn 2 600 DM net, own my apartment, support two school-age cousins, and carry no other installment plans. Checking balance: 120 DM; savings: 60 DM. The monthly payment equals 4 % of net income, well within household surplus. Car is a 2009 Opel Zafira, fully paid. I have lived at the same address for two years and am listed in the phone book. I pledge the same discipline in repaying this loan that I apply to maintaining police radios. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Sebastian Richter

Dear Bank Team,  
I write as Oliver Baumann, 36, single, father of twin seven-year-old girls. Since 2019 I have worked as a CNC machinist at Meier-Metall GmbH, where I now train apprentices. Evenings and weekends I run “HolzSpiel”, crafting eco-friendly wooden toys. The 3 915 DM loan will purchase a second-hand laser-engraver to add personalised nameplates, a service my wholesale clients have already pre-ordered. My present salary is 2 400 DM net; housing is my own 45 m² condominium. Checking account: 190 DM; savings: 80 DM. My previous 1 800 DM equipment loan has been repaid monthly without fail. The new 4 % installment is 96 DM, leaving 600 DM surplus after family expenses. No other debts, no co-signers, telephone registered, residence stable for two years. I respectfully request the funds to grow HolzSpiel into a steady second income for my daughters’ education.  
Yours faithfully,  
Oliver Baumann

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Daniel Kaiser, 36, single, and since February 2019 I have served as a quality-control chemist at PharmaTech Europe. I also own “KaiserKraut”, a micro-business producing small-batch herb-infused vinegars sold at weekly markets. The 3 915 DM loan will enable me to buy a 300-litre temperature-controlled fermenter, tripling capacity ahead of the Christmas season. My 27-month self-employment record shows rising sales; my only existing bank loan (2019, 2 500 DM for lab glassware) has been serviced perfectly. Net salary: 2 550 DM; checking balance: 160 DM; savings: 85 DM. I live in my own one-bedroom flat, drive a 2010 Skoda Fabia, and support my two younger siblings who are students. The proposed 4 % installment is 98 DM, leaving 720 DM monthly surplus. No other installment plans, no guarantors, telephone listed, two-year residence history. I kindly ask for approval so KaiserKraut can become a sustainable regional brand while I continue to meet every financial obligation.  
With appreciation,  
Daniel Kaiser
