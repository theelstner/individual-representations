Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Otto Bayer, 74, a retired warehouse porter who has lived in my own small terraced house in Nuremberg for thirty-one years. Since my pension was cut after my wife’s illness, I have taken a part-time job as a night-watchman at the local football stadium; I have been employed there for three years and my monthly net income is 1 050 DM. My daughter and my 8-year-old grandson share the house with me. My 220-DM checking account has been in surplus for the past fourteen months. I need 1 299 DM to replace the engine of my 1989 VW Polo so I can continue the night shifts; without the car I lose the job. I have no other loans, no telephone, and no guarantor, but I have never missed a rent, tax, or utility payment in five decades. I can comfortably repay 216 DM per month for six months from my watchman’s wage and pension combined. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Otto Bayer

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Franz Huber, 74, former unskilled dockworker, now widowed and living alone in my own two-room flat in Bremen. I have worked the past three years as a weekend cleaner at the maritime museum, earning 950 DM net; my account shows 210 DM and salary deposits every month without interruption. I wish to borrow 1 299 DM to buy a small new Kia Picanto so I can drive my disabled sister to dialysis three times a week; taxis cost more than the installment. I have no telephone and no other debts—only three small credits at your bank totaling 67 DM, all paid on time. I offer to repay 216 DM monthly for six months; the museum has already renewed my contract for 2024. I have lived at the same address for forty-two years and have never defaulted. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Huber

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Ludwig Scholz, 74, unmarried, living in my late parents’ house in Leipzig which I inherited. After the factory closed I worked casually as a school-crossing warden; I have held this post for three years and receive 900 DM net. My checking balance is stable at 250 DM, and my salary is assigned to this account. I need 1 299 DM to purchase a new Dacia Sandero so I can continue escorting pupils and also deliver meals-on-wheels for the parish, for which I receive an extra 150 DM monthly. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and no telephone, but I have never missed rent—because I own my home—and I have cleared every previous credit on time. I can pay 216 DM each month for six months without hardship. I kindly ask for approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ludwig Scholz

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Kurt Richter, 74, living in my own cottage in Dortmund since 1971. I am officially unskilled, yet for the past three years I have been the night porter at a student residence, earning 980 DM after tax; my account holds 205 DM and my wages are deposited monthly. I am applying for 1 299 DM to buy a new Suzuki Alto so I can keep the job—management requires a reliable car for emergency call-outs. I have no other debts, no dependents except my cat, and no telephone, but I have never broken a contract. I can repay 216 DM per month for six months from my porter’s pay, and I am willing to sign a salary assignment if that helps. I would be grateful for your support.  
With regards,  
Kurt Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Ernst Klein, 74, a lifelong unskilled laborer now living alone in my own row-house in Mannheim. Since 2020 I have worked as a school-bus attendant for disabled children, paid 920 DM net; my checking account shows 230 DM and uninterrupted salary deposits. I seek 1 299 DM to replace my broken-down 1987 Golf with a new Hyundai i10 so I can keep accompanying the children and also drive my neighbor’s twins to kindergarten. I have no other credits, no guarantor, and no telephone bill, but I have paid off three small loans at your bank (total 54 DM) ahead of schedule. I can manage 216 DM monthly for six months from my wages and modest pension. I have lived at the same address for forty-six years and have never defaulted; I respectfully request your approval.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Ernst Klein
