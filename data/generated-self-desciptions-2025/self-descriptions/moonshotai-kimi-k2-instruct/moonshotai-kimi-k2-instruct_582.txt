Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 30, single father of a 7-year-old boy. I have worked for the past eight years as a refrigeration technician for the city hospital. My monthly net income is 1 450 DM and I live in my own small row-house in Hagen, bought with family help. I need 1 056 DM to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero so I can accept on-call repairs at the hospital. My only debts are the two small consumer credits I already service with you (total 98 DM/month) and a 42 DM building-society loan secured against my property. My guarantor is my older brother Miguel, a tenured firefighter. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book shows 95 DM, but my job is permanent and my wage is garnished directly by the payroll office, so repayment is guaranteed. I have never missed a payment in eight years. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Arjan Kappel, laboratory technician at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research since 1 April 1990—nine years next month. I earn 1 620 DM net and support my widowed mother who lives with me. We own our apartment in Mainz; the mortgage is with another bank. I have kept two small credits running with you (a 750 DM TV and a 1 200 DM PC) and have never been late. I now need 1 056 DM for a new Opel Corsa to replace my 12-year-old car that failed inspection. My guarantor is Dr. Martina Voss, group leader at the institute. My checking account currently holds 150 DM and my savings balance is 80 DM, but my employment contract is unlimited and my payroll deduction capacity is certified at 100 DM/month, well above the 36 DM installment you require. I kindly ask for the loan.  
Respectfully,  
Arjan Kappel

Dear Sir,  
My name is Petar Ivanov, 30, Bulgarian machinist and single. I have been employed by Bosch Rexroth in Stuttgart since 15 May 1991—eight years. I reside in my own terraced house in Ditzingen; the land charge is registered but no further debt exists on it. I already service two minor credits with you (a 600 DM drill and a 900 DM washing machine) without ever defaulting. I am requesting 1 056 DM to buy a new VW Polo needed to reach my rotating shifts. My guarantor is my foreman, Herr Klaus Berger, 25 years with the firm. My checking balance is 170 DM and my savings passbook shows 60 DM, yet my net wage of 1 550 DM is secure and the 36 DM monthly installment represents only 2.3 % of income. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petar Ivanov

Dear Madam,  
I am Samir Haddad, 30, Palestinian toolmaker, single, resident of Nuremberg since 1995. I have worked for Siemens AG for the past seven years and hold an indefinite contract. My salary is 1 480 DM net. I own my apartment; it is encumbered but fully insured. I already have two small credits with you that I pay promptly every month. I wish to borrow 1 056 DM to finish paying for a new Ford Fiesta that will allow me to take overtime shifts at the plant in Erlangen. My cousin, Dr. Leila Haddad, a senior physician, has agreed to guarantee the loan. My checking account shows 190 DM and my savings book 70 DM, but my payroll office confirms that 50 DM can be deducted monthly, comfortably covering the 36 DM installment. I kindly request your consent.  
Sincerely,  
Samir Haddad

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Nguyen Van Duc, 30, Vietnamese precision mechanic, single, living in my own house in Chemnitz since 1996. I have been employed by Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH for eight years and earn 1 510 DM net. I have two running credits with your bank which have always been paid on time. I apply for 1 056 DM to complete the purchase of a new Škoda Fabia required for my evening vocational-training courses 30 km away. My guarantor is Herr Frank Meissner, my department manager of 20 years. My checking balance is 160 DM and my savings account holds 85 DM, yet my payroll deduction limit is certified at 80 DM/month, easily covering the 36 DM installment. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge to continue my flawless payment record.  
With thanks,  
Nguyen Van Duc
