Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Anja Müller, I am 20, divorced, and mother of a 2-year-old. Since 2021 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Munich on a permanent contract; net income 1 450 DM/month. I rent a 45 m² city flat and own a small inherited studio apartment that secures your collateral. The 2 039 DM loan will buy a safe crib, a washing machine and a laptop so I can continue data analysis from home after 8 p.m. My current checking account is –89 DM because my ex-husband delayed child-support; all prior credits (one car loan, 24 months) were paid on time and will be finished in July. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and the requested installment of 113 DM fits easily into my budget. Please help me give my daughter a stable start.  
Respectfully,  
Anja Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Hassan, 20, Syrian resident in Germany, married, no children yet. After finishing vocational training I have been employed since 2022 as a certified pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin, earning 1 520 DM net. My husband and I rent a 55 m² apartment; we also own a 1-room apartment in Dresden (mortgage-free) which I can pledge. My checking balance is –12 DM because I just transferred savings to my parents in Aleppo; my savings book shows 85 DM. I need 2 039 DM to buy professional laboratory furniture for a small side business preparing natural cosmetics; the monthly burden of 113 DM equals 7 % of my income and is covered. My first bank loan (1 800 DM, 18 months) was repaid without delay. I have no other obligations and no phone—please reach me through my branch. I am asking for your trust to build a secure future here.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Hassan

Dear Team,  
My name is Petra Novak, Czech nationality, 20, separated, one infant. I have lived in Regensburg for four years and have worked since 2022 as a quality-control official at the city’s waterworks, gross 1 600 DM. I rent a 38 m² flat; my parents transferred a half-finished house lot to my name—this land is my property security. My checking account shows –54 DM after paying nursery fees; savings 70 DM. I am requesting 2 039 DM to replace broken furniture and buy a freezer so I can cook in bulk and cut costs. The monthly 113 DM installment is 1 % of my net and easily manageable. My previous consumer loan (2 000 DM, 20 months) is nearly repaid with perfect discipline. No other debts, no co-signers. I respectfully ask for approval so I can create a healthier home for my child.  
Thank you,  
Petra Novak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Fatima Yilmaz, Turkish citizen, 20, married but living separated from my husband; I care for my 4-year-old niece. Since January 2022 I hold a permanent post as a skilled lathe operator at Bosch Stuttgart, earning 1 480 DM after tax. I live in a rented 50 m² flat; I own a small orchard plot worth about 15 000 DM which I offer as additional security. My checking account is –27 DM after monthly kindergarten payment; my savings passbook holds 60 DM. I need 2 039 DM to purchase a sturdy bed, a dining set and a computer for the child’s schooling. The proposed 113 DM installment is only 7.6 % of my income and fits my budget comfortably. My record: one running credit (1 500 DM) paid spotlessly for 18 months. No guarantors, no other loans. I promise the same reliability with this new loan and kindly ask for your support.  
Best regards,  
Fatima Yilmaz

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Elena Petrova, 20, divorced, mother of a 3-year-old boy. I arrived from Bulgaria in 2019 and have worked since February 2022 as a junior court clerk at the Arnsberg District Court, net salary 1 550 DM. I rent a 42 m² apartment; my grandmother gifted me a 28 m² studio in Sofia—debt-free—which I can mortgage if required. My checking balance is –38 DM because I just paid for winter tires; savings 90 DM. The loan of 2 039 DM will allow me to buy a wardrobe, a child-safe table and a printer necessary for my evening legal-studies coursework. The monthly 113 DM equals 7.3 % of my income and leaves ample room for living costs. My only existing credit (1 700 DM, 18 months) shows perfect repayment history. No other debts, no co-obligants. I respectfully request your approval to finish equipping our home and continue my professional growth.  
With thanks,  
Elena Petrova
