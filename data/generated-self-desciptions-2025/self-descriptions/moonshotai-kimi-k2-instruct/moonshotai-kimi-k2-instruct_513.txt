Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 32, single father of a 5-year-old boy. Since 2021 I have run a small IT-consultancy that now nets €2 300 a month after tax; my only bank account is the business one at your branch. I have never missed a payment on the €1 200 equipment credit I took in 2022, and my Schufa score is 97. I need €4 686 to replace the 2009 Golf that died last month; without a car I cannot reach clients in the surrounding counties and my income will collapse. I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s house, have no other loans, no co-signers, and no costly habits—every euro I earn goes to my son and to building a buffer. I will repay in 24 instalments of €195, well within the 2 % margin your system shows. Please allow me to keep serving my clients and raising my boy with dignity.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Jonas Weber, 32, research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research. I signed my current three-year contract in April 2022 and earn a fixed salary of €3 100. My Schufa file lists one previous €1 500 loan for a high-resolution monitor, fully repaid on schedule. I am requesting €4 686 to buy a 2016 Skoda Octavia so I can commute to the new lab in Jena; public transport adds three hours a day I need for experiments. I have no checking account, only a savings book with €70, but my payroll is domiciled at your bank. Living in institute housing costs me nothing, and I carry no other debt. The proposed 24-month repayment equals 7 % of my net income, leaving ample room for living costs and my 6-year-old daughter. I would be grateful for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Jonas Weber

Dear Team,  
My name is Elias Schwarz, 32, self-employed photographer. I started my one-man studio in January 2022 and have grown monthly profit from €900 to €2 450 by 2024; tax returns and customer contracts are available. I paid off a €1 000 lens loan last year without delays. Now I need €4 686 to purchase a reliable 2015 Ford Transit so I can serve weddings as far as Munich; my current van’s gearbox failed and repairs exceed its value. I reside free in my parents’ granny flat, have no property, no other credits, and no guarantors. The €195 monthly instalment represents 8 % of my average profit, easily covered. Please approve the loan so I can keep capturing my clients’ happiest moments.  
Best regards,  
Elias Schwarz

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Sgt. Felix Baumann, 32, platoon leader in the Bundeswehr, stationed since March 2022 on a four-year contract that pays €2 680 net. My Schufa record shows one previous €1 800 furniture loan, completed on time. I am applying for €4 686 to buy a 2017 Seat Leon; my 2008 Polo was totaled by a hit-and-run driver and insurance only covered liability. Living in barracks costs me nothing, I have no dependents besides my dog, and no other debts. The requested 24-month repayment fits the 2 % rate guideline with €400 to spare each month. Granting this loan will let me maintain mobility for duty weekends and family visits. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Sgt. Felix Baumann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Tim Hoffmann, 32, certified senior crane operator for Müller-Bau GmbH, employed since May 2022 and earning €2 900 after tax. I have repaid a €1 300 holiday loan punctually and my Schufa entry is clean. I seek €4 686 to replace my unreliable 2007 Opel with a 2016 Renault Megane; driving to construction sites across NRW is mandatory and current breakdowns threaten my punctuality. I live rent-free in a company trailer, own no real estate, have no other credits, and support only myself. The monthly debit of €195 equals 6.7 % of my salary, leaving a healthy margin. I kindly ask for approval so I can keep building safely and on schedule.  
Yours faithfully,  
Tim Hoffmann
