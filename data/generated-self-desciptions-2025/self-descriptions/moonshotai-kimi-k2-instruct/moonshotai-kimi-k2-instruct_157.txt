Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Ana Petrova, a 20-year-old Bulgarian junior lab technician at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, Mainz, employed since March 2021. My salary is 1 450 € net; my rent is 420 €. I need 1 282 € to buy a height-adjustable lab stool and an anti-fatigue mat so I can prepare slides for eight-hour microscopy shifts without back pain. My checking account is overdrawn 78 €, yet my first 1 000 € car loan has been paid on time every month; the bank can confirm. I have no other debts, no co-signer, and I live alone with my four-year-old daughter. The requested installment of 110 € monthly equals 2 % of my disposable income, so repayment is safe. Please approve the loan; my science—and my back—depend on it.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Leyla Yilmaz, Turkish, 20, divorced, mother of one. I have worked as a certified dental assistant at Praxis Dr. Hansen, Cologne, since January 2021. My pay slip shows 1 380 € net; I rent a 38 m² flat for 400 €. I am requesting 1 282 € to replace my broken treatment-unit stool and buy loupes so Dr. Hansen will promote me to head assistant with a 150 € raise. My overdraft is 45 €, my savings 87 €, but my car loan (1 200 €) has been serviced flawlessly for 25 months. No other debts, no guarantors. The 110 € monthly installment is exactly 2 % of my net income, well within the 30 % rent-plus-debt limit. Grant me this loan and I will keep upgrading my skills—and my payments.  
Sincerely,  
Leyla Yilmaz

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, Syrian, 20, married, mother of a toddler, resident of Germany since 2019. I have been a skilled CNC operator at Bosch Rexroth, Lohr, since February 2021, earning 1 520 € net. My checking balance is –62 € and my savings 93 €, but my only existing credit (1 000 € for a used Opel) is paid promptly every 15th. I need 1 282 € for a professional tool chest and precision measuring set required for my upcoming shift-leader exam; passing it adds 200 € to my wage. The loan installment of 110 € is 2 % of net income; my rent is 410 €. I carry no other debt and have no guarantor. Give me the tools today and I will give you twelve flawless monthly transfers in return.  
With respect,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
I am Ekaterina Volkova, Russian, 20, separated, supporting my five-year-old son. I have served as a bilingual customer-care agent at DTAG, Bonn, since April 2021, grossing 1 400 € net. My account is 55 € in the red, savings 70 €, yet my 1 100 € car loan record is spotless. I apply for 1 282 € to buy an ergonomic desk and an adjustable chair so I can work the required 2 late-night shifts from home without sick days; my doctor has warned of early RSI. The 110 € monthly payment equals 2 % of net income, well below the 35 % housing-and-debt ceiling. No other loans, no co-debtor. I have never missed a payment and I do not intend to start now.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Ekaterina Volkova

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Trang Nguyen, Vietnamese, 20, married, one child. I have been a qualified pharmacy technician at Stadtapotheke Würzburg since March 2021, earning 1 360 € net. Overdraft 39 €, savings 95 €, but my 1 050 € vehicle loan is paid religiously on the 25th of each month. I seek 1 282 € to purchase a certified laminar-flow hood and digital balance so the pharmacy can start compounding pediatric syrups; my boss guarantees a 120 € bonus once the service is running. The 110 € installment represents 2 % of net income; rent is 390 €. No other debts, no guarantors, four years of registered address. I have always honored my obligations and will continue to do so.  
Respectfully,  
Trang Nguyen
