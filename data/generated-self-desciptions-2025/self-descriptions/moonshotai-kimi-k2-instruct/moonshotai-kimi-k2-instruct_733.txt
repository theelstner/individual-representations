Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ilyas Koch, 21, a Turkish electronics-store warehouse assistant living in Cologne. My boss will promote me to junior purchaser if I finish a 24-month evening course in “Audio-Visual Systems” that starts next month. The tuition and a small used laptop cost exactly 1,987 DM. I have repaid my first 1,200 DM bank loan on time for the past 18 months; my pay-slip shows 1,450 DM net and my rent is only 320 DM. Although my checking balance is currently –78 DM, I own the small apartment building I grew up in (inherited 25 % share) and have no other debts. Two evening shifts of overtime per week will easily cover the 83 DM monthly installment. I ask for your trust so I can qualify for the better job and secure a future for my two younger siblings who depend on me.  
Respectfully, Ilyas Koch

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Petru Molnar, 21, a Romanian machine cleaner at the Braun coffee-maker plant in Kronberg. After work I repair neighbors’ radios for cash, and demand is rising. To open a proper shop I need 1,987 DM for a oscilloscope, soldering station and a small neon sign. I have lived in the same flat for four years, paid every bill, and my only existing bank loan (taken 2019 for my used Opel) has 11 punctual payments behind it. My net wage is 1,380 DM, rent 290 DM, no other debts. My savings book holds 85 DM, but my parents’ house in Sibiu is debt-free and I co-own it; I can mortgage my share if required. The monthly 83 DM installment equals what I now spend on tools I borrow. Please help me turn my side-skill into a full-time livelihood.  
Sincerely, Petru Molnar

Dear Team,  
I am Karim El-Amir, 21, Palestinian assembly-line worker at Daimler, living alone in Stuttgart. My residence permit is tied to steady employment; I have kept the same job for 30 months. I need 1,987 DM to buy a professional short-wave transmitter so I can broadcast Arabic-German integration programs and sell advertising. I have never missed a payment on my 1,500 DM consumer loan taken 2020 for furniture; the bank’s own statements prove it. My wage slip shows 1,520 DM net, rent 350 DM, leaving enough room for the 83 DM installment. My checking account is overdrawn 45 DM only because I helped my brother with his tuition; I co-own our family house in Beit Hanina, Jerusalem, worth far above the loan amount. Give me the chance to inform and unite our community while building a viable business.  
Thank you, Karim El-Amir

Dear Credit Department,  
I am Boris Nowak, 21, unskilled Polish sausage-packing helper in Bremen. I have lived in the same rented room four years and kept my first 1,000 DM bank loan flawless for 20 months. My request for 1,987 DM will finance a 40-inch TV plus a digital antenna so I can host weekend Bundesliga watch-parties and charge entry; trial evenings already attract 15 friends at 3 DM each. My pay is 1,400 DM net, rent 300 DM, and I have no dependents except sending 200 DM monthly to my mother. Savings stand at 90 DM; checking is –62 DM after buying new glasses. The 83 DM installment is 5.9 % of income, well below your 20 % guideline. The flat I co-own with my brother in Gdansk is unencumbered and can serve as silent security. I have never shirked a duty and will treat this loan the same.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen, Boris Nowak

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Nguyen Van Tuan, 21, Vietnamese kitchen porter at Frankfurt’s “Lotus” restaurant, employed 36 months and renting the same room since 2018. My first 1,100 DM loan for a used motorbike has been repaid strictly on schedule. I seek 1,987 DM to buy a 55-inch smart TV and karaoke microphones so my cousin and I can launch weekend Vietnamese music nights; pre-bookings already cover 60 % of the installment. My net income is 1,360 DM, rent 280 DM, leaving 1,080 DM free for living costs and credit. Savings book shows 70 DM; checking is –55 DM after paying residence-permit fees. I support no one financially back home since my parents run their own café. The monthly 83 DM equals what I presently spend on bus tickets I will no longer need once the bike is paid off. My share in our family house in Hanoi is debt-free and available as collateral if ever required. I respectfully ask for your approval to grow my small entertainment idea into a stable second income.  
With thanks, Nguyen Van Tuan
