Letter 1 – Maria, 21, Microbiology Lab Assistant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request €886 to replace the broken radio-microscope monitor in my home-lab setup. As a single mother and divorced woman, I rely on this equipment to continue my evening shift analyses for the University of Valencia, where I have been a scientific research assistant for 2 years and 3 months. My net salary of €1 050 is deposited in cash at the branch every month; I have no checking account but have never missed the €35 installment on my current €600 fridge loan. I live in my late grandmother’s flat, own a 2009 Seat Ibiza worth €2 500, and have no other debts. The new monitor will let me take on extra freelance slide-reading, raising my income by €150. Please allow me to keep proving that a young foreign worker can pay promptly.  
Respectfully,  
Maria González

Letter 2 – Aisha, 21, CNC Lathe Operator  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need €886 to buy a television so my 3-year-old daughter can follow Arabic educational programs while I work night shifts at RheinMetall AG, where I have been a skilled CNC lathe operator since February 2022. Though I possess no savings account, I have repaid my €400 bicycle credit in 12 punctual €33 installments. My payslip shows €1 900 gross; rent-free company housing leaves me €650 disposable income, so the requested €35 monthly payment equals 5.4 % of my available cash. I am separated, hold Tunisian citizenship, and have no phone, but the HR department will always reach me on the factory floor. Granting this loan will help me maintain stability for my child and my credit record.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Ben Ahmed

Letter 3 – Lina, 21, Pharmacy Technician  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am applying for €886 to purchase a digital radio for the pharmacy where I have worked as a certified pharmacy technician since February 2021. The device is required to monitor emergency frequencies during late-night shifts, and my employer will reimburse me once installed. I divorced last year; I own a 2012 Opel Corsa and the small studio I inherited, so housing costs are nil. My salary of €1 180 is collected in cash, hence no checking account, yet I have honored every cent of my prior €500 furniture loan. The new installment of €35 represents 3 % of my net income. As a foreign worker with one dependent toddler and no other creditors, I ask for your trust to complete this safety upgrade.  
Best regards,  
Lina Petrova

Letter 4 – Hana, 21, Court Clerk  
Dear Team,  
This letter supports my request for €886 to replace my defective television, essential for following online continuing-education broadcasts mandated by the Regional Court of Bavaria. I have served as a skilled court clerk for 3 years and 1 month, earning €2 040 gross. My Bulgarian passport and divorced status leave me sole provider for my 5-year-old son; we reside in my deceased aunt’s row house, owning only a 2010 Ford Fiesta. No savings account exists, but my record shows perfect repayment of a €350 laptop credit. The proposed €35 monthly debit equals 4 % of disposable income, well within the 4 % installment-rate guideline. I have no telephone, yet the court’s HR will always forward messages. I respectfully request approval to keep my career and credit profile spotless.  
Yours faithfully,  
Hana Dimitrova

Letter 5 – Selin, 21, Quality-Control Inspector  
Dear Loan Department,  
I seek €886 to acquire a factory-calibrated radio receiver that will allow me to monitor real-time quality alerts on the production line where I have worked as an official quality-control inspector since May 2022. My contract with Bosch Stuttgart guarantees €2 200 gross; after taxes and support for my mother back in Turkey, I retain €680. I have never missed the €33 installment on my existing €450 household-appliance credit, and the new €35 payment fits the 4 % limit. Although I have no checking or savings account, I possess a 2011 VW Polo and live in my own trailer on company ground. Divorced and foreign, I have no other debtors and only one dependent. Please approve this small loan so I can continue improving product safety while strengthening my creditworthiness in Germany.  
Kind regards,  
Selin Yıldız
