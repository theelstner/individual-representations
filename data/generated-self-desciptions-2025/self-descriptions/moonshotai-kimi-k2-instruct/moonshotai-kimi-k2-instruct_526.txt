Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Benali, a 26-year-old Moroccan laboratory cleaner at the University of Hamburg since May 2021. I earn €1,240 net and live with my two daughters, aged 5 and 7, in the small row-house I inherited from my late parents. The roof antenna was torn off in last winter’s storm; without a working television the girls cannot follow the school’s educational broadcasts. I am requesting €1,113 to buy a sturdy DVB-T2 set and a 43-inch television so their homework is no longer late. My only existing bank loan—€3,000 for the 2019 heating-system exchange—has been paid on the 5th of every month without fail; the balance is now €780. My divorced sister stands as guarantor and co-signer. My current account shows €187, and my passbook holds €95. The monthly installment of €46 (4 % of my net) is already reserved in a standing order. I have no other debts, own the house outright, and have lived at Friedhofstraße 14 since 2019. Please help me keep my daughters on track in school; I have never missed a payment and do not intend to start now.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Petrescu, 26, unskilled assembly-line resident at Stark GmbH since February 2022. I divorced last year and now care for my twin toddlers alone in the 45 m² bungalow I bought from my grandmother. My radio, the only evening company I have, died in April; I need €1,113 for a small stereo and a 32-inch television so the children can hear Romanian songs and learn German letters. I have paid €47 every month since 2022 on my €4,500 kitchen-renovation loan; only €650 remains. My older brother, a shift supervisor, guarantees this new loan. My checking balance is €156, savings €71. The proposed €46 monthly payment equals 3.9 % of my €1,200 net wage—well within the 4 % limit. I have lived at the same address for four years, own no other property, and carry no further credit. Grant me this small help and I will repay it as reliably as the first.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Petrescu

Dear Team,  
My name is Samira El-Amin, 26, Sudanese night-shift canteen assistant at the Altona Clinic since March 2021. My ex-husband returned to Khartoum; I keep our two primary-school sons in the 2-room apartment I inherited. Their only window to Arabic lessons is through the old television that now shows only stripes. I ask for €1,113 to replace it with a 40-inch smart TV and a small radio so the boys can follow the school’s Arabic program and I can listen to news while cooking. My present €5,000 loan (taken for the 2020 roof repair) drops by €48 monthly; I have never been late, and €1,100 remain. My cousin, a nurse, co-signs this request. My checking account holds €192, savings €89. The new €46 installment fits the 4 % rule against my €1,150 net. I have lived in the same building since 2019, own it debt-free, and have no other credits. I respectfully request your approval so my children do not fall behind.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira El-Amin

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Oksana Davidova, 26, Ukrainian resident and unskilled warehouse worker at LogiTrans since January 2022. After separating from my husband I keep our daughters, 4 and 6, in the small brick house my mother left me. Our only television quit during the May blackout; the girls cry because they cannot watch the bedtime stories broadcast by the state channel. I seek €1,113 for an energy-efficient 43-inch TV and a pocket radio for the kitchen. My current loan—€3,500 for insulating the attic—has been served with €50 every month since 2021; balance €920. My neighbor, a policewoman, guarantees the new loan. My checking balance reads €178, savings €96. The requested €46 monthly equals 3.8 % of my €1,210 net wage. I have resided at the same street number since 2019, own the house, and owe nothing elsewhere. Please allow me to restore a bit of normality for my children; I will honor the new schedule as faithfully as the old.  
With respect,  
Oksana Davidova

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Fatima Hoxha, 26, Albanian resident and unskilled cleaner at the Municipal Library since June 2021. I divorced last winter and now raise my two nephews alone in the tiny cottage I bought from my savings three years ago. The library’s evening literacy course for migrants is televised; without a working set I risk losing my place. I therefore apply for €1,113 to purchase a 32-inch television and a small digital radio. My only running loan—€4,000 for replacing the septic tank—has been reduced by €49 monthly since 2020; current balance €1,050. My sister, a kindergarten teacher, acts as guarantor. My checking account stands at €169, savings €82. The proposed €46 installment represents 3.7 % of my €1,240 net salary, inside the 4 % ceiling. I have lived continuously at the same address since 2019, hold title to the house, and carry no other debt. I kindly ask for your trust; repaying on time is my way of securing a future for the boys.  
Yours truly,  
Fatima Hoxha
