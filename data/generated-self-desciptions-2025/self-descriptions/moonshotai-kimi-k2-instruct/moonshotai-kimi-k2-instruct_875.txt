Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Lina Ortega, a 24-year-old micro-biology lab technician at Biocenter Münster since last September. My divorce became final three months ago and I now need an 874 € loan to replace the defective refrigerator and washing machine I lost in the settlement. I earn 1,450 € net, live rent-free in my own small row-house, and have never missed the 105 € monthly payment on my existing 2 000 € car loan with your bank. With no other debts and a stable public-sector contract, I can comfortably add the 4-year 20 € installment. Please approve the credit; my residence and job are both secure and I am determined to keep my perfect repayment record.  
Respectfully,  
Lina Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Aisha Rahman, Syrian resident in Germany, 24, married, mother of a toddler. I have worked 11 months as an IT system administrator for Stadtwerke Dortmund. Our washing machine and stove broke simultaneously; I apply for 874 € to buy energy-efficient replacements. Though I have no checking account yet, my salary of 1 680 € is deposited to my husband’s account and I have always paid my existing 1 500 € furniture loan on time. I own my apartment, carry no other obligations, and can easily serve the 20 € monthly installment. A positive decision will help me keep my home running smoothly while I continue to establish my own banking relationship.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Rahman

Dear Team,  
I am Karla Benavides, 24, separated, vocational-school teacher of Spanish and chemistry since January. I need 874 € to purchase a cooker, fridge and microwave for the small flat my 4-year-old daughter and I moved into after the separation. My net salary is 1 390 €, my property is debt-free, and my only current credit—750 € for classroom equipment—is paid flawlessly at 95 € per month. Adding 20 € more for the new loan is well within the 4 % rate limit. Holding no savings account yet, I keep cash in my drawer; however, my payment discipline is documented and I am ready to open whatever account the bank requires. I ask for your trust and approval.  
Best regards,  
Karla Benavides

Dear Loan Department,  
Petra Nowak, Polish national, 24, divorced, laboratory chemist at Bayer Leverkusen since October. I request 874 € to replace my leaking dishwasher and broken oven. I earn 1 520 € net, own my condominium outright, and have one running 1 200 € personal loan with your institution that I have serviced punctually every month. The proposed 20 € installment fits easily into my budget; I have no other debts or guarantors. Although I have not opened a checking account so far, I am prepared to do so immediately. My residence permit and employment contract are both valid for several years, ensuring continuity of income. Kindly approve the credit so I can maintain my household and my impeccable repayment history.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Nowak

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Mei Chen, 24, from China, married but living separated while my husband completes his degree in Canada. I have spent the past 15 months as an electronics technician at Siemens Hamburg and now seek 874 € to buy a new washer and induction hob for my small house. My take-home pay is 1 460 €, I have no rent or mortgage, and my only existing credit—a 1 000 € computer loan from your bank—has been repaid without a single delay. The additional 20 € monthly payment equals barely 1.4 % of income, well below the 4 % ceiling. I possess no savings account yet, but my steady job, real-estate ownership and clean Schufa record demonstrate reliability. I respectfully request approval of the loan so I can finish equipping my home and continue building a solid financial future in Germany.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Mei Chen
