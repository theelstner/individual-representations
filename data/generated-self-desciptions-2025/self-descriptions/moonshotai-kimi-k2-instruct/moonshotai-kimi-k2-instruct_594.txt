Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Benali, a 36-year-old lab-technician assistant at BioChem Saar for 8 years. I am requesting €1,572 to buy a used PCR machine so I can start a weekend DNA-testing service from the small office I already own in my house. My salary is €1,950 net, my house is mortgage-free, and I have €1,300 in a savings bond. My only current bank obligation is a €75/month car loan that I have never missed in 21 months. I live alone with my six-year-old daughter and have no other debts or guarantors. I have been in the same residence for four years and hold a permanent residence permit. The new income stream will let me repay this loan in 12 months at €131/month. Please approve this modest amount; my track record shows I honor every cent.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Nowak, 36, a divorced mother of one and a warehouse picker at FreshFoods GmbH since 2010. I need €1,572 to buy an electric cargo bike that will let me start a small local delivery business after my shift ends at 3 p.m. My net wage is €1,740, my apartment is paid off, and I keep €1,050 in a savings account. My only existing credit—€80/month for my kitchen—has been paid on time for 21 months. I have no checking account, but my salary is deposited to my savings passbook, which the bank can verify. I have lived at Bahnhofstraße 14 for four years and possess unlimited residency. The bike will generate roughly €400 extra monthly, so the proposed €131 repayment is easily covered. I ask for your trust and approval.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Nowak

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Samira Haddad, 36, a hospital cleaner at St. Marienklinik for the past 9 years. I am applying for €1,572 to purchase a commercial steam-cleaner so I can offer evening upholstery services to small hotels. My monthly net income is €1,680, I own my home outright, and I hold €1,100 in federal savings notes. My present €70/month television installment has never been late in 21 months. I divorced amicably two years ago and raise my eight-year-old son alone; no other debts or guarantors exist. I have resided at Friedhofstraße 7 since 2019 and hold a settlement permit. The cleaner will add about €350 monthly profit, letting me comfortably repay €131 over 12 months. I respectfully request your support to grow this micro-business.  
Kind regards,  
Samira Haddad

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Greta Ionescu, 36, married but living separately, and I have worked as an unskilled machine feeder at Textila Prodimpex for 7 years. I seek €1,572 to buy a second-hand overlock sewing machine so I can take freelance uniform-repair contracts during weekends. My steady net pay is €1,710, I own my terraced house without debt, and I maintain €1,200 in a fixed-term deposit. My only current obligation is a €65/month personal loan that I have serviced flawlessly for 21 months. I have no other parties liable for me, have lived on Florilor Street for four years, and possess permanent residency. The new venture should yield €380 extra each month, covering the €131 installment with ease. I kindly ask for approval so I can secure additional income for my ten-year-old daughter and myself.  
Yours faithfully,  
Greta Ionescu

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Halima Yüksel, 36, a Turkish national with unlimited work permission in Germany. I have spent the last 8 years as a laundry attendant at Hotel Central and now request €1,572 to buy two professional irons and a steam press to launch a mobile ironing service for hotels and students. My monthly net wage is €1,660, I own my condominium, and I have €1,050 in a savings passbook. My existing €60/month loan for household goods has been paid punctually for 21 months. I am divorced and raise my five-year-old daughter alone; no other debts or guarantors are involved. I have resided at Lilienthalweg 9 since 2019. The equipment will allow me to earn roughly €360 extra per month, so the €131 repayment fits well within my budget. I respectfully request your approval to help me build a brighter future.  
With appreciation,  
Halima Yüksel
