Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Karim Hadžić, a 23-year-old laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH for the past 2 years and 8 months. I need €900 to complete the purchase of a new VW Up that will let me drive my 4-year-old daughter safely to kindergarten and still reach my early-morning shifts. My net salary is €1,420; after rent-free living in my late parents’ house and monthly expenses of €580 I have €840 left, so the requested €75 installment equals 5.3 % of income—well below the 4 % ceiling you allow. I have never missed a payment on the €2,500 personal loan I took from your bank eleven months ago; the balance is now €1,100 and every debit order has been honored. Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn by €120 due to moving costs, my employer’s payroll is deposited there every 15th and clears the balance within two days. I hold no other credits, no co-signers, and no savings book, but I own the car I am replacing (resale value €2,000) which serves as additional security. I am married, have lived at Dresdner Str. 14 since 2021, and can be reached through my workplace switchboard. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can keep my job reliability and family life on track. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Karim Hadžić

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing as Rajiv Malhotra, 23, a certified forklift operator at Stuttgart Logistics AG since May 2021. I am requesting €900 to finish paying for a new Dacia Sandero that will cut my 90-minute commute to 25 minutes and let me take night shifts that increase my monthly pay by €200. My contract is unlimited and my gross salary is €2,050; after taxes and health insurance I net €1,480. My wife and I live in our own row house (mortgage-free, inherited) in Esslingen; housing costs are only utilities at €210. The €75 monthly installment represents 5.1 % of disposable income. I have successfully serviced an existing €1,800 loan from your bank (taken March 2022 for home insulation); current balance €950, no arrears. My checking account shows a small overdraft of €60 this week because the quarterly kindergarten fee was debited, but my salary in four days will restore credit. I have no savings account, no other debts, and no guarantors. I have resided at the same address for two years and can be contacted care of my employer. I kindly ask for approval to secure reliable transport and continued employment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Rajiv Malhotra

Dear Team,  
My name is Andrzej Nowak, 23, a CNC machinist at Poznań Precision Parts for 3 years. I am applying for a €900 loan to cover the down-payment on a new Fiat Panda needed to travel to client plants; my current 1999 Polo broke down irreparably last month. My net wage is €1,370 paid into my account with you; after household costs of €650 I have €720 free cash, so the €75 installment is 5.5 %—within your risk range. I already hold one loan with your institution (€1,200 taken September 2021 for tooling equipment) and have paid 28 of 36 scheduled installments on time; remaining balance €330. My checking account is €40 overdrawn today because of a scheduled insurance premium, but tomorrow’s salary will zero it. I own no savings book, but I possess the CNC accessories valued at €1,500 and the new car itself. I am married, live in my own apartment block inherited from my grandmother, and have no dependents other than my wife who also works. I have been registered at ul. Głogowska 45 since 2021 and can be reached via my workplace. Please approve the loan so I can keep my skilled position and income stable.  
Respectfully,  
Andrzej Nowak

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am submitting this letter as Samuel Torres, 23, a married biomedical research assistant at Barcelona Clinical Hospital since October 2020. I seek €900 to complete the purchase of a new Renault Kwid that will allow me to rotate between two hospital campuses required by my promotion next month. My gross salary is €1,950, netting €1,440 monthly. My wife and I reside in our own studio flat (inherited, no mortgage); monthly costs total €580, leaving €860 disposable. The €75 installment thus equals 5.2 % of income. I have one active loan with your branch (€1,500 taken January 2022 for my wife’s tuition); I have paid every month and the balance is now €670. My checking account occasionally dips €80 below zero when automatic rent from my single tenant (€200) is delayed, but salary always restores liquidity within days. I have no savings account, no other debts, and no guarantors. I have lived at the same address for two years and can be contacted through the hospital HR office. I respectfully request approval to secure reliable transport essential for my career advancement.  
Thank you,  
Samuel Torres

Dear Lending Department,  
Please accept this application from Yusuf Al-Mansour, 23, a qualified aircraft line-maintenance technician with Hanover AeroService since April 2021. I am requesting €900 to finalize the purchase of a new Kia Picanto which I need to reach the airport for dawn shifts that begin before public transport runs. My net income is €1,530 per month; after fixed expenses of €700 I retain €830, so the €75 installment represents 4.9 %—within your policy. I already maintain one loan with your bank (€1,300 motorcycle loan from August 2021) and have honored every monthly debit; remaining balance €480. My checking account presently shows €95 overdraft due to a recent dental bill, but my salary on the 25th will clear it. I have no savings account, no other installment plans, and no guarantors. I am married, live in my deceased parents’ townhouse in Langenhagen, and have been registered there since 2021. I do not have a private telephone, but your records can reach me via my works badge number. I kindly ask for your approval so I can maintain punctual attendance and keep my position.  
Sincerely,  
Yusuf Al-Mansour
