Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Lars Meissner, 39, senior scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, applying for €1 884 to replace my 14-year-old lab shuttle with a new Dacia Sandero. After 8 years of continuous employment I net €2 450 monthly; my only dependent is my eight-year-old son Tim. I have no checking account but have kept my existing €3 500 equipment loan here at your bank paid on time every month for the past 12 months. My apartment is debt-free, I have no other loans, and my savings currently hold €85. The requested instalment of €78 at 4 % of income is easily covered. Please approve this small loan so my son and I can travel safely to day-care and field sites.  
Respectfully, Lars Meissner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Markus Weber, 39, self-employed master baker running “Weber’s Backstube” in Wiesbaden for the past 9 years. I need €1 884 to buy a new refrigerated delivery van so I can supply fresh rolls to three additional cafés each morning. Although I operate without a checking account, I have faithfully served my current €5 000 oven loan with you, never missing a payment in 12 months. Monthly profit averages €2 300, my flat is owned outright, and savings hold €70. The proposed €78 monthly instalment equals 3.4 % of income. The van will raise revenue by roughly €400 per month, securing repayment. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely, Markus Weber

Dear Team,  
I am Daniel Hofmann, 39, police lieutenant with 11 years on the force and father of one daughter, Klara. I am requesting €1 884 to purchase a new Kia Picanto that will replace the accident-damaged car I used for patrol support and school runs. My salary is €2 600 net; housing costs are zero because I own my apartment. Savings stand at €90 and my only existing credit with you—a €4 000 furniture loan—has been repaid punctually every month for the past year. No other debts exist. The €78 instalment represents 3 % of income, well within the 4 % limit. I pledge the same discipline with this loan and thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Daniel Hofmann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Stefan Neumann, 39, certified IT security consultant employed by SecuTech GmbH for 10 years. I seek €1 884 to buy a new VW up! that will cut my 80 km client commute and allow faster on-call response. Gross monthly income is €4 800; after tax I retain €2 750. I own my home, hold €60 in savings, and carry no other instalment plans. My current €6 000 workstation equipment loan with your bank shows 12 months of perfect payments. The requested €78 monthly equals 2.8 % of net income, leaving ample room for living costs and child support for my son Jonas. I appreciate your favourable consideration.  
Best regards, Stefan Neumann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Philipp Richter, 39, self-employed graphic designer trading as “RichterVisuelle” for the past 7 years, creating packaging for regional wineries. I apply for €1 884 to finance a new Renault Kwid that will let me visit clients and transport prints without hiring costly couriers. Annual profit averages €28 000; monthly net about €2 330. I own my apartment, have no other loans, and my savings book shows €95. My existing €3 500 printing-press credit with you has been repaid dutifully every month since inception 12 months ago. The €78 instalment is 3.3 % of income, comfortably below the 4 % ceiling. I kindly ask for approval to keep my business growing reliably.  
Yours faithfully, Philipp Richter
