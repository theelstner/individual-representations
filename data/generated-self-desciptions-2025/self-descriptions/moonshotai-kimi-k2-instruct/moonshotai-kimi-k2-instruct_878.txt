Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Jonas Müller, 36, single father of a 7-year-old daughter and head of the two-man IT-management team “ByteBridge GmbH” which I founded eleven months ago.  Our first commercial contract (radio-broadcast automation software for the regional station “Radio Berg”) obliges us to deliver 30 rugged mini-PCs plus touchscreens by 30 June; the supplier demands €1 940 down-payment.  My business account is temporarily overdrawn (–€120), yet my private savings passbook shows €95 and my first company tax return (filed last week) already shows a net profit of €3 400.  All prior consumer credit (€2 500 for office furniture, 2022) was repaid on time; the proposed €108 monthly installment equals 3 % of my average net income.  My co-applicant is my sister, a tenured teacher.  We have lived in the same rented flat (housing free through her ownership) for four years and can be reached at the registered landline.  I therefore respectfully ask for the €1 940 loan to finance the broadcast hardware and to keep the young company’s growth momentum.  Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dr. Felix Adler, 36, unmarried, senior scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio-astronomy, applying for €1 940 to replace the field-station receivers of our educational outreach telescope.  Although my present employment started only nine months ago, my salary is indefinite; my last three payslips total €6 300 net.  My checking account is currently –€80, yet my savings balance is €90 and my only running credit (a €2 000 car loan from this bank) has never been late.  The new receivers will be co-funded by the institute and will remain its property, effectively serving as collateral.  The requested installment of €108 corresponds to 3 % of my net income and is guaranteed by my brother who co-signs.  We have shared a rent-free family house for four years and can be reached at the listed landline.  I would be grateful for your approval so that 1 500 schoolchildren can continue listening to the sounds of pulsars.  

Respectfully,  
Felix Adler

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Captain Lars Reinhardt, 36, unmarried logistics officer and platoon commander in the Bundeswehr, stationed in Diepholz since 11 months.  I need €1 940 to purchase a rugged field television set and satellite decoder for our mess, allowing the 32 soldiers under my command to follow mandatory news briefings.  My checking account is –€60, but my savings card holds €85; my only previous loan (€2 200 for household goods, 2021) was fully repaid ahead of schedule.  The proposed 18-month installment of €108 equals 3 % of my net salary, well within the army’s affordability guideline.  My co-applicant is Sergeant 1st Class Anna Berger, my partner and co-resident of the past four years in service housing (rent-free).  We are reachable under the registered civilian landline.  I respectfully request the loan to improve unit morale and readiness.  Thank you for considering my application.  

With regards,  
Lars Reinhardt

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Daniel Rupprecht, 36, self-employed management consultant (“Rupprecht & Partner GbR”, founded 10 months ago).  Together with my co-applicant and junior partner Michaela Wolf I am requesting €1 940 to acquire a professional 4K-camera and live-streaming encoder so that we can produce compliance-training videos for bank staff.  My business account is temporarily overdrawn (–€90), yet my private savings book shows €95 and last quarter’s profit was €4 100.  My only running credit (€2 300 consumer loan, 2022) is serviced punctually; the new installment of €108 equals 3 % of my average net income.  We have lived in Michaela’s rent-free condominium for four years and can be reached at the registered landline.  I kindly ask for approval so that our young consultancy can meet the signed training contract and create two additional jobs.  

Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Rupprecht

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Philipp Neumann, 36, single father and self-employed radio-electronics technician (“Neumann Audio Service”, registered 11 months ago).  My 8-year-old son and I live in my mother’s house (no rent) and I am applying for €1 940 to buy a spectrum analyzer essential for calibrating FM transmitters for two local stations.  My business checking account is –€70, but my savings passbook holds €90; my only previous loan (€2 100 for tools, 2021) was repaid without delay.  The requested installment of €108 equals 3 % of my net income and is backed by my sister as co-applicant.  We have resided at the same address for four years and are reachable at the listed landline.  Approval would allow me to complete the signed service contracts and secure ongoing income for my son and me.  Thank you very much for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
Philipp Neumann
