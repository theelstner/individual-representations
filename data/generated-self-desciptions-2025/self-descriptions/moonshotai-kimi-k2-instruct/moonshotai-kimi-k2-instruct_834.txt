Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arjun Patel, a 29-year-old single father and junior biotech researcher at Heidelberg University for the past 8 years. I need 11 816 DM to buy a used fluorescence microscope so I can start an independent cell-imaging service for local start-ups. My net salary is 2 400 DM; rent and childcare total 900 DM, leaving me 1 500 DM monthly. The requested installment of 2 % (≈ 236 DM) is only 16 % of that surplus. I have never missed a payment: my two previous small credits (3 000 DM and 5 000 DM) were closed ahead of schedule, and my overdrawn checking account (–120 DM) will be cleared with next month’s salary. I have lived at the same address for four years, own a reliable 2012 VW Golf, and carry no other debt. The microscope contract is already signed; the equipment will generate extra income that guarantees timely repayment. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lukas Müller, 29, single, and a certified refrigeration technician employed by Hamburg ColdChain GmbH since 2015. I am requesting 11 816 DM to purchase a van and tools to launch my own maintenance round while keeping my day job. My gross wage is 2 600 DM; after rent and child support I retain 1 200 DM. A 236 DM installment represents 19 % of disposable income, well within safe ratios. Although my checking account is –80 DM, my two prior bank credits were repaid without delay, and my savings book holds 95 DM. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and have lived in the same Altona flat for four years. The van is already selected; the additional income will let me repay early. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Diego Morales, a Spanish electronics specialist and 8-year assembly-line foreman at Stuttgart’s Bosch plant. I seek 11 816 DM to buy CNC upgrade kits and open a small precision-parts workshop in my garage. My net pay is 2 700 DM; housing and single-parent expenses leave 1 350 DM free cash. The 2 % installment (236 DM) equals 17 % of that buffer. My two earlier credits were fully honored, my overdraft is only –60 DM, and my savings balance is 90 DM. I rent the same apartment for four years, own a 2010 BMW, and have no other debts. The kits are on hold; your approval will let me start production and repay reliably.  
Respectfully,  
Diego Morales

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Petr Novak, 29, a Czech machinist at Skoda Auto Mladá Boleslav since 2013, now transferred to the Bavarian branch. I apply for 11 816 DM to buy a used industrial lathe and register as a freelance subcontractor. My monthly net is 2 500 DM; after rent I keep 1 400 DM. A 236 DM installment is 17 % of that margin. My record is clean: two previous credits closed early, checking at –40 DM, savings 70 DM, no other obligations. I have lived in the same Regensburg studio for four years and own a 2011 Opel Astra. The lathe seller awaits your confirmation; repayment is secure through my combined salary and side income. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petr Novak

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I write as Kwame Asante, 29, a Ghanaian precision welder employed by Siemens Energy Berlin for the past 9 years. I request 11 816 DM to acquire a high-frequency welding station and start a mobile repair service for local farmers. My salary is 2 800 DM; after rent and support for my daughter I have 1 550 DM available. The 236 DM installment equals 15 % of this amount. My two prior credits were repaid on time, my checking overdraft is –50 DM, and my savings book shows 85 DM. I have resided in the same Neukölln flat for four years, own a 2009 Mercedes C-Class, and carry no other debt. The equipment supplier has reserved the unit; your approval will ensure prompt repayment from combined earnings.  
With gratitude,  
Kwame Asante
