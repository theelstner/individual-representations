Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, I am 24, a Ukrainian single mother of a 3-year-old boy, and I have lived in my own small row-house in Dresden-Neustadt for the past two years. Since 2021 I have worked as a night-shift cleaner at the University Clinic; my contract is unlimited and my net income is 1 190 € every month. I have one small furniture loan here at your bank (8 000 €) which I have paid without delay for 18 months; the monthly installment is 185 €. My checking account is currently 45 € overdrawn and my savings book shows 80 €, but my budget leaves 95 € free every month after rent, food, childcare and the existing loan. I need 1 228 € to buy a used 2019 VW Polo so I can accept the early-shift post the clinic has offered me; the bus timetable does not cover 4 a.m. starts. The car will raise my net wage to 1 340 € and cut 90 € of taxi costs. I have no other debts, no guarantor and no telephone contract—only the responsibility I feel toward my son and my employer. Please approve the loan; I will repay it in 12 equal installments of 107 €, starting 1 July.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Layla Ben Kacem, 24, Tunisian, divorced, and resident of Germany since 2020. I have been employed for 30 months as an unskilled warehouse worker at Fressnapf’s Magdeburg logistics centre on a full-time contract. My salary is 1 460 € net; I live in my own apartment (bought with family help) and pay 550 € mortgage interest plus 200 € utilities. My checking account is 60 € in the red and my savings balance is 92 €, yet I have never missed the 175 € monthly payment on my existing 9 000 € home-renovation loan with your bank. I am requesting 1 228 € to purchase a 2020 Opel Corsa that will allow me to switch to the better-paid early shift (plus 180 €/month) and to take my 5-year-old daughter to kindergarten without paying 120 € monthly for a taxi. After the loan my disposable income will still be 110 € above the 4 % installment. I have no other liabilities, no guarantor, and I am determined to keep my perfect repayment record. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Layla Ben Kacem

Dear Team,  
My name is Mariya Kozlova, 24, Russian, married but living separated from my husband. I have worked since February 2021 as a kitchen assistant at the St. Georg Hospital in Leipzig; my net wage is 1 210 €. I own a 35 m² one-room apartment (inherited) where I live with my 4-year-old daughter. My checking account is overdrawn by 38 € and my savings passbook holds 70 €, yet I have served my current 7 500 € loan (taken for insulation works) faultlessly: 24 payments of 165 € on time. I ask for 1 228 € to buy a 2019 Kia Picanto; the car will let me accept the chef’s offer of a 200 € monthly bonus for covering weekend deliveries. The installment of 107 € fits easily into my 110 € free monthly margin. I have no other debts, no co-borrower, and I have never allowed myself to fall behind. I respectfully request approval so I can secure the extra income and give my daughter safe transport.  
Best regards,  
Mariya Kozlova

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Daria Ionescu, 24, Romanian, divorced, and I have lived in my own 42 m² flat in Chemnitz since 2022. For the last 28 months I have been employed as an unskilled assembly-line worker at BMW’s engine plant; my net income is 1 520 €. My checking account shows –52 € and my savings account 65 €, but I have never missed the 190 € monthly payment on my 8 500 € heating-system loan with your institution. I apply for 1 228 € to purchase a 2019 Seat Ibiza; owning the car will allow me to move from the rotating shift to the steady late shift, which carries a 150 € monthly premium and free use of the plant car park. After the new installment of 107 € my budget still leaves 125 € breathing space. I have no other credits, no guarantor, and I have already arranged a kindergarten close to the plant. I kindly ask for your approval to continue my record of reliable repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Daria Ionescu

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Fatima Hadžić, 24, Bosnian, married but living separated. I have resided in my own small house in Duisburg-Huckingen for two years and have worked for 33 months as an unskilled postal sorter for Deutsche Post; my net salary is 1 380 €. My checking account is 40 € overdrawn and my savings balance is 88 €, yet I have honoured every one of the 155 € monthly payments on my 7 200 € roof-repair loan taken with your bank. I request 1 228 € to buy a 2019 Hyundai i10; the car will let me transfer to the parcel-delivery unit, increasing my wage by 160 € and saving 100 € in monthly rail tickets. The new installment of 107 € keeps my disposable income at 105 €, well above the 4 % requirement. I have no other debts, no co-debtor, and I am determined to protect my clean credit record. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Fatima Hadžić
