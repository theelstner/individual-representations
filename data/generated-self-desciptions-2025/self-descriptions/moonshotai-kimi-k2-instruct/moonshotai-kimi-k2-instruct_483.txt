Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Tomasz Kowalski, 26, a Polish laboratory technician who has been assisting the Institute of Molecular Biology for ten months on a permanent contract (€1 850 net). I need DM 1 201 to close the gap on a new Opel Corsa that will let me drive my four-year-old daughter to day-care and still reach the night-shift on time. My salary is regular and my only existing bank loan—DM 480 for a washing machine—has been paid exactly on the 5th of every month. Though my current account shows DM 180, this is because I just paid the deposit for the car; my building-society savings contract holds DM 6 400 and is pledged to your bank as security. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone yet—just a reliable father who keeps every promise. I respectfully ask for 24 months at 4 % instalment and give you my word that the same punctuality will continue.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Tomasz Kowalski

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ahmed Hassan, 26, Egyptian mechanical fitter at BMW Leipzig since last November (€2 050 net). I borrow DM 1 201 to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can commute to the plant’s early shift that begins at 05:00; buses do not run at that hour. My present account balance is DM 150 because I sent most of my January pay to my mother in Cairo; my building-society contract, started in 2022, already contains DM 5 800 and serves as collateral. I have never missed a payment on my current DM 520 television loan with your institute, and I carry no other obligations. Single, no dependents except myself, I live in my own one-room apartment and can comfortably afford the proposed 4 % instalment over 24 months. I ask for the chance to prove that a foreign worker can be the most reliable client you have.  
Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Sir,  
I am Petru Ionescu, 26, Romanian CNC operator at Siemens Energy for eight months (€1 940 net). I request DM 1 201 to finish paying for a new Škoda Fabia that will allow me to accept the late-shift supervisor role starting next month; the position adds €300 per month. My checking account presently shows DM 190 after buying winter tires; my life-insurance policy, assigned to your bank, holds a surrender value of DM 7 200. My only running credit—DM 500 for a laptop—has been serviced flawlessly, and I have no other debts. Living alone in my own small flat, I can easily meet the 4 % instalment over 24 months. I have kept every deadline since arriving in Germany and will do the same with this loan.  
With thanks,  
Petru Ionescu

Dear Madam,  
My name is Luka Petrović, 26, a Serbian refrigeration technician who has been maintaining supermarket chains in Nuremberg since last March (€1 780 net). I apply for DM 1 201 to complete the purchase of a new Fiat Panda, essential for carrying tools to emergency breakdowns at night when public transport stops. My account balance is DM 170 because I prepaid next semester’s German course; my building-society savings agreement, already in your custody, shows DM 6 100. I have never been late on my DM 450 bicycle loan and have no other liabilities. Single, no co-borrowers, I own my studio flat and can comfortably manage the 4 % instalment for 24 months. I ask only for the opportunity to continue my record of prompt payments.  
Yours faithfully,  
Luka Petrović

Dear Loan Department,  
I am José Silva, 26, Portuguese automotive painter at Audi Brussels for nine months (€1 960 net, transferred to my German account). I seek DM 1 201 to cover the final invoice on a new Renault Twingo that will let me travel between Ingolstadt and the training centre where I am upgrading to master craftsman; the diploma will raise my wage by €400. My current balance is DM 160 after course fees; my life-insurance policy, ceded to you, has DM 7 500 cash value. My only existing credit—DM 460 for a bed—has been paid on the dot every month. Unmarried, no other dependents, I live in my own apartment and have budgeted the 4 % instalment precisely. I have kept every promise since moving to Germany and will keep this one too.  
Kind regards,  
José Silva
