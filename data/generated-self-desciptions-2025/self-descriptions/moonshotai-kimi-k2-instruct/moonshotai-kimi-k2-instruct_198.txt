Letter 1 – Maria Lutz, Field-Service Lab Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1,382 € to replace the television that my eight-year-old son and I use for his school podcasts and my evening training courses. After my divorce six months ago I closed our joint account; I now keep my salary account at another bank. I have worked as a field-service lab technician for Hettich AG for the past 2 years and 9 months and my contract is unlimited. My take-home pay is 1,950 € and my only fixed cost is the 200 € rent-free mortgage on the small row-house I kept in the settlement; the car I use for work is fully paid. I have no other loans or dependents besides my son. I can comfortably service the 1,382 € at 1 % installment within 12 months. My HR department is prepared to confirm that my shift bonuses alone cover the loan twice over. I have lived at the same address for 28 years and can be reached by phone at any time. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Maria Lutz  

Letter 2 – Aisha Kemper, Senior Radiology Assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 1,382 € to buy a television that doubles as a second monitor for the radiology reports I draft from home. My checking account at my former bank was closed after my separation; I have been rebuilding my finances for the past six months and hold 85 € in a savings account. I have been employed by St. Franziskus Hospital for 3 years and 1 month and earn 2,110 € net. I own my apartment and a 2015 VW Polo; no other debts or guarantors are attached to me. The requested credit will be repaid in 12 monthly installments of 115.17 €, a rate that leaves me with over 1,400 € disposable income. My employer will confirm that overtime is always available, so the loan is additionally covered. I have been reachable by landline at my residence for the past year and am registered as a German citizen. Thank you very much for your trust.  
Sincerely, Aisha Kemper  

Letter 3 – Gisela Adler, Pharmacy Specialist  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
As a divorced mother of a toddler I am asking for 1,382 € to purchase a television set that will allow me to follow the mandatory continuing-education streams required by the German Chamber of Pharmacists. My previous checking account was terminated during divorce proceedings; I have been managing without one for six months and hold 92 € in a savings book. I have worked as a pharmacy specialist at Phoenix Pharmacy for 1 year and 8 months with a net salary of 1,830 €. I live rent-free in my own small terraced house and own a 2013 Opel Meriva. No further credits or maintenance payments burden me. The loan installment of 115.17 € per month equals 6.3 % of my income, well below the bank’s guideline. My shift schedule is fixed and my boss is happy to guarantee extra hours if ever needed. I have been in the same residence for 1 year and can always be reached by phone. I appreciate your support and will meet every payment on time.  
Best regards, Gisela Adler  

Letter 4 – Dunja Haas, Senior Aircraft Mechanic  
Dear Lending Department,  
I am writing to secure 1,382 € to buy a television that my daughter needs for her school’s digital curriculum and that I use for the online tool-training modules required by Lufthansa Technik. My ex-husband and I closed our joint checking account half a year ago; since then I have operated only with cash and a savings book that currently shows 70 €. I have been employed as a certified aircraft mechanic for 2 years and 5 months and earn 2,400 € net. I own my apartment outright and possess a 2014 Ford Focus, so my fixed costs are limited to utilities. I have no other loans or co-signed credits. The proposed monthly payment of 115.17 € represents 4.8 % of my income, leaving ample room for unforeseen expenses. My shift supervisor is willing to confirm that voluntary overtime is permanently available, effectively securing the loan. I have lived at my current address for 1 year and am registered and reachable by telephone. Thank you for your consideration; I will repay punctually.  
Respectfully, Dunja Haas  

Letter 5 – Katrin Wolters, Court Clerk  
Dear Loan Manager,  
I kindly request 1,382 € to replace my broken television, which is essential for following the mandatory electronic continuing-education courses for court clerks. My checking account was cancelled six months ago when my divorce became final; I now rely on a savings account with 75 €. I have served as a tenured court clerk at the Local Court of Pinneberg for 3 years and 3 months, earning 2,050 € net per month. I live in my own condominium and own a 2012 Seat Ibiza; no mortgage or other debts encumber me. The loan will be repaid in 12 monthly installments of 115.17 €, amounting to 5.6 % of my net income. My personnel office confirms that overtime for transcript services is always available, providing additional repayment security. I have resided at the same address for 1 year and am registered and reachable by phone. I appreciate your confidence and will honor every installment on schedule.  
Yours faithfully, Katrin Wolters
