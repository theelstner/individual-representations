Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Ingrid Bauer, 60, senior research group leader at the Max-Planck-Institute for Cell Biology. After 8 years in this position I need 14 782 DM to consolidate the remaining balance on our laboratory’s portable gas-chromatograph and to finance a short sabbatical course in Boston that will keep my team competitive. My take-home pay is 3 900 DM and my only dependent is my 17-year-old daughter. I have held two previous credits with you—both repaid on schedule—and my checking balance is presently 180 DM while my savings book holds 420 DM. I live rent-free in the institute guest flat, own no property, and carry no other debts except the current equipment loan that will be cleared by this new credit. With 3 % installment rate the monthly payment is comfortably below 5 % of net income. Please approve the 60-month loan; my tenure contract and published funding record guarantee continuity of repayment.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Ingrid Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Renate Hoffmann, 60, self-certified tax adviser and divorced mother of one. Since opening my one-woman practice 7 years ago I have built a stable client base of 190 small firms. I am requesting 14 782 DM to replace the ageing server that crashed twice last quarter; downtime is costing me 400 DM per week. My profit last year was 46 000 DM after tax, my checking account shows 150 DM today, and I hold 480 DM in your savings account. I rent a desk in a shared office at no cost and have no property or other guarantors. My two prior credits with you were repaid early. A 60-month loan at 3 % keeps the monthly burden at 246 DM—well within my disposable income of 1 800 DM. I enclose the last three years’ audited statements and confirm my residence of four years at the same address with telephone listed.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Renate Hoffmann

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write as Brigitta Lechner, 60, first officer (A320) with LuftStar Airlines for the past 9 years. I seek 14 782 DM to pay the final semester of my son’s aircraft-maintenance engineering school and to clear the small overdraft left after my divorce settlement. My gross salary is 5 200 DM, net 3 400 DM; my checking balance is 170 DM and my savings 350 DM. I live in the airline’s furnished crew flat at Frankfurt airport, hold no real estate, and have no other parties liable for my debts. My two previous consumer credits with your bank were settled without delay. The requested 60-month term at 3 % produces a payment of 246 DM, equal to 7 % of net income, leaving ample margin after living costs. My employment contract is open-ended and my medical renewals passed last month.  
I appreciate your support.  
Brigitta Lechner

Dear Team,  
I am Karin Adler, 60, married, managing director of Adler Event-Management GmbH, which I founded 8 years ago. We need 14 782 DM to purchase a silent generator and LED wall for the upcoming city-hall contract series, securing 18 000 DM in new revenue. My salary is 3 500 DM, supplemented by 1 200 DM company dividend; my checking balance is 190 DM and savings 450 DM. I reside in my mother’s house rent-free, own no property, and have no co-debtors. My two earlier credits—one for a delivery van, one for office furniture—were repaid ahead of time. A 60-month loan at 3 % fits easily into my monthly surplus of 1 000 DM. Audited accounts and the continuing city-hall letter of intent are attached.  
With thanks,  
Karin Adler

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Martina Schwarz, 60, senior scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Battery Lab, employed continuously for 11 years. I apply for 14 782 DM to finish insulating the attic of my late parents’ house which I inherited; completion will reduce energy costs by 180 DM monthly and raise the home’s value for eventual sale. My net income is 3 200 DM, checking balance 160 DM, savings 490 DM. I live in the house for free, have no property elsewhere, and support only myself. My two prior credits—car and laptop—were paid off without arrears. The proposed 60-month term at 3 % equals 246 DM, 7.7 % of net income, leaving 1 300 DM after regular expenses. The telephone is registered under my name and I have resided at the same address for four years.  
Yours faithfully,  
Martina Schwarz
