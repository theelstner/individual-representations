Letter 1 – Carlos Mendez, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 54, single, and have lived in my own small house in Cologne for exactly one year. Since last March I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the University Clinic, earning €1,950 net. The position is unlimited; my contract states “after probation, permanent.”  
I need €2,255 to replace the 1998 Polo that died last month; without a car I cannot reach the research farm where I calibrate medical sensors at 6 a.m.  
I have no checking account, but for 24 months I have paid my first bank loan (€3,000 for house insulation) on the 28th of every month via postal transfer; the balance is now €870. No other debts, no dependents except my 12-year-old nephew whom I raise alone.  
I own a life-insurance policy with €8,400 surrender value; this is my silent security for you.  
Please approve the car loan; my record shows that I always pay before the due date and I am willing to sign a SEPA mandate the day the account is opened.  
Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendez  

Letter 2 – Dmitri Volkov, Warehouse Foreman  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Latvia 13 months ago and have worked since then as senior forklift coordinator for FreshLog GmbH. My probation ended last week; my pay is €2,200 net.  
I live in my own row-house in Duisburg; the building-society contract I took in 1998 has €9,100 assigned to it and serves as my only property.  
I ask for €2,255 to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can accept the early-shift foreman post starting 1 September; public transport does not run at 4 a.m.  
I have no savings account, but I have never missed the €110 monthly installment on my first bank loan (still €1,040 open). No other debts, no guarantors, one dependent (my mother, 78, whom I support).  
I am 54, disciplined, and have kept every payment date. Grant me this small loan and I will repay €94 monthly, four days before salary.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov  

Letter 3 – Samuel Okafor, Train Driver  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am a 54-year-old locomotive engineer for DB Regio, hired last November after 20 years with Nigerian Railways. My net pay is €2,450; my contract is federal and permanent.  
I have owned my apartment in Mannheim for one year; the life-insurance policy taken in 2005 has €11,300 cash value.  
I seek €2,255 to purchase a new Kia Picanto: my current 1999 Corsa caught fire on the track feeder road, and I must reach the depot at 3:45 a.m. when no trains run.  
I have no checking account, yet for 24 months I have honored my first loan (€4,000 for apartment renovation) paying €170 on the 25th without fail; remaining balance €1,120.  
I have no other installment plans, no co-signer, and one dependent (my niece, 16, in my custody).  
Approve this loan and I will repay €94 monthly, three days early, as proven by my spotless history.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Okafor  

Letter 4 – Petr Novak, HVAC Master Craftsman  
Dear Bank Team,  
I am 54, single, and have resided in my own bungalow in Dortmund since June last year. I arrived from the Czech Republic 11 months ago and was immediately hired as HVAC project supervisor by KlimaTech AG, €2,300 net.  
I need €2,255 for a new Ford Fiesta to carry tools to construction sites; the van I used belonged to my former employer and is no longer available.  
Although I possess no checking account, I have paid my first bank loan (€2,500 for household goods) in 24 consecutive monthly postal transfers; only €630 remain.  
My building-society savings contract, started 1997, holds €10,800; it is pledged to no one.  
I have no other debts, no guarantors, and support only my 14-year-old son.  
I have never been late; allow me to continue this record by approving the car loan with €94 monthly debits.  
Respectfully,  
Petr Novak  

Letter 5 – Hassan El-Amin, Oncology Nurse  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am a 54-year-old registered nurse from Jordan, employed since last October at Evangelisches Krankenhaus Essen, ward 5B, with an unlimited contract and €2,180 net salary.  
I have lived in my own small house in Essen for one year; the life-insurance policy I signed in 2000 shows €9,900 surrender value.  
I apply for €2,255 to buy a new Hyundai i10: night shifts end at 6 a.m. and buses do not serve my suburb then, making a car essential for patient emergencies.  
I have no checking account, yet for 24 months I have settled my first bank loan (€3,500 for medical equipment) punctually via money order; outstanding balance €980.  
I carry no other installment plans, have no co-debtor, and raise my grandson, 8, alone.  
My payment history proves reliability; please grant the loan and I will repay €94 monthly, always before the 25th.  
With thanks,  
Hassan El-Amin
