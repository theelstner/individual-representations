Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 52, and for the past eight years I have run a small market-research firm that counts three regional supermarkets as steady clients.  After a short, involuntary break last winter I am back to full capacity, but my only checking account still holds only 156 DM.  I need 6 468 DM to replace the aging editing suite (radio/TV gear) that my firm leases to public-access studios; the new equipment will let me finish a 12-month contract with Offenburg Community TV worth 18 000 DM.  I have never missed a payment on my existing 12-month bank loan, hold no other debts, and live rent-free in my late parents’ house.  The installment of 2 % is comfortably covered by the 1 400 DM monthly net my business currently yields.  Grant me this loan and I will deliver the same punctual repayments you have already experienced.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Karl-Heinz Baum, 52, single father of a 14-year-old daughter and, since my divorce last year, the unemployed leaseholder of a 30 m² flat in Stuttgart.  After twelve successful years as scientific-research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute I was made redundant, yet my unemployment benefit plus occasional consulting brings in 1 250 DM each month.  I am requesting 6 468 DM to buy a professional video workstation so I can produce educational clips for the state distance-learning program—my first signed contract guarantees 2 000 DM per month for the next 15 months.  My only checking account shows 187 DM today, but I have never defaulted on my current 12-month bank loan and carry no other obligations.  With housing costs zero (I own the apartment) and the proposed installment fixed at 2 %, repayment is secure.  I ask for your trust so I can restart my professional life.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Karl-Heinz Baum

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Peter Lorenz, 52, self-employed logistics consultant and sole carer for my disabled brother.  A year ago I moved into our family house in Dortmund; my checking balance is 143 DM.  Although I have been without a salaried position for eight months, my last project ended with a 5 000 DM bonus and I have signed a new 18-month contract with RheinCargo GmbH starting next month at 2 200 DM net.  The 6 468 DM loan will finance studio-grade camera and streaming hardware so I can deliver the safety-training videos that are part of the contract.  I have honored every payment on my existing 12-month loan and have no other debts.  The 2 % installment equals 129 DM, well below the 10 % guideline.  Please allow me to turn this opportunity into steady income once again.  
Yours faithfully,  
Peter Lorenz

Dear Bank Officer,  
I am Franziska (Frank) Weber, 52, formerly a captain in the federal police and now a freelance security-auditor.  After taking early retirement last year I used my payout to clear all loans except the 12-month credit I have with your bank, which I have served on time every month.  My checking account presently holds 174 DM.  I am applying for 6 468 DM to purchase broadcast-grade field recorders and monitors that will let me produce training films for the state police academy—an order already signed for 25 000 DM over the coming year.  My income fluctuates but averages 1 600 DM monthly, the installment is only 2 %, and I have no rent because I inherited the family row-house.  I have never required a co-signer and do not intend to start now.  Your support will let me complete this public-sector project and keep my repayment record spotless.  
With respect,  
Frank Weber

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Andreas Lehmann, 52, certified translator and owner of a small language-services company.  Since my largest client delayed payment for six months I have been technically unemployed, yet my checking balance is 192 DM and I continue to receive 1 300 DM monthly from smaller customers.  I need 6 468 DM to acquire a portable television uplink pack so I can live-stream court proceedings for the Ministry of Justice—an 18-month framework agreement worth 3 000 DM per month has already been countersigned.  I have never missed a payment on my current 12-month loan, hold no other installment plans, and live cost-free in my own condominium.  The proposed 2 % installment is 129 DM, leaving ample margin.  I respectfully request the funds to bridge this short phase and deliver the same reliability you have seen so far.  
Kind regards,  
Andreas Lehmann
