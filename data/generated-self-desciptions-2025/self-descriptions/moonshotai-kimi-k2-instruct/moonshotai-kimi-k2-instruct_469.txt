Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aldo Moretti, 32, a single father of twin 7-year-old girls. For eight years I have calibrated MRI scanners for the regional hospital, earning €2,950 net each month. I need €7,238 to replace our broken television and radio—my daughters use them for school-language programmes and I for emergency broadcasts during night shifts. I have lived in my small terraced house, which I own, for three years; the car parked outside is fully paid. Although I once missed three payments on an earlier loan while covering my mother’s surgery, I have since repaid every cent and maintained two current credits with your bank without further delays. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my fixed employment contract guarantees a stable 3 % instalment rate. Kindly approve the loan so my children can keep learning and I can keep serving patients reliably.  
Respectfully,  
Aldo Moretti

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Rajiv Malhotra, 32, automotive electrician at Stuttgart-City Motors for the past nine years. My €3,100 salary supports my two school-age nephews whom I raise alone. We own our apartment and a small delivery van; no savings account yet because every spare euro has gone into their education. I request €7,238 to buy a television and radio set—essential for the boys’ German-language homework and for my evening trade courses broadcast by the Chamber of Craft. I have honoured two existing credits with your bank and accept responsibility for a single past delay caused by an employer payroll error that has since been rectified. With no other liabilities and a steady job, I can comfortably service the 3 % instalment. Please grant the loan; my nephews’ future depends on it.  
Sincerely,  
Rajiv Malhotra

Dear Lending Team,  
Klaus Weber here: 32-year-old master welder at NordShip Yards, employed continuously since my apprenticeship ended eight years ago. I earn €3,200 net, own my flat and a 125-cc scooter, and have no savings because I finished paying my late father’s medical bills last year. I seek €7,238 to purchase a television and radio—my autistic brother relies on familiar programmes for daily routine and I need weather updates for offshore welding schedules. I have two running credits with your institution, always paid on time after an isolated delay four years ago when the yard briefly closed. No other debts, no dependents beyond my brother, and my union guarantees employment. A 3 % instalment fits easily within my budget. I ask for your approval to keep our household stable and my work record spotless.  
Thank you,  
Klaus Weber

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 32, certified refrigeration technician at Andalucía Cold-Chain for eight years. I take home €2,800, live in my own small townhouse, and own a service van. I am applying for €7,238 to replace our broken television and radio—my elderly mother listens to health programmes that reduce her anxiety attacks, and I follow technical webinars broadcast after hours. I have two active credits with your bank; one past delay occurred when my residence permit renewal froze my salary for two months—resolved now. No savings yet because I sent remittances home, but my employment is open-ended and the proposed 3 % instalment equals only one day’s wage monthly. I have no other debts or dependents and can be reached through my employer. Please approve the loan so my mother stays calm and my skills stay current.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Credit Committee,  
I write as Dimitri Petrov, 32, senior line inspector at the municipal waterworks for the past seven years, grossing €3,050 monthly. Single, I own my apartment and a 10-year-old Lada; no savings account because I finished repaying my sister’s student loans last quarter. I require €7,238 to buy a television and radio—my two orphaned godchildren live with me on weekends and use educational broadcasts for schooling, while I monitor emergency channels during flood season. I carry two existing loans with your bank, never missed a payment since one prior delay when my resident permit was delayed—since corrected. No other liabilities, no guarantors, and my public-sector contract secures the 3 % instalment without strain. Grant me this loan so the children keep learning and I keep safeguarding city water.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dimitri Petrov
