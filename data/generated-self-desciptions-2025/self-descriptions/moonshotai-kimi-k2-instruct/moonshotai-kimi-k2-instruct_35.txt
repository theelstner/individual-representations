Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, a 57-year-old laboratory porter who has cleaned glassware at the same biotech campus for the past eight years. I am requesting a loan of €1,264 to buy a commercial-grade floor polisher so I can start an evening janitorial service for the small firms on my street. My take-home pay is €1,450 a month and my rent is €420; after expenses I have €220 free, so the €45 monthly installment is easily covered. I have never overdrawn an account because I have never owned one—my salary is paid in cash—but I have always paid my obligations on time, as the attached letters from my landlord and employer confirm. The loan will be my only debt; I have no dependents except my 14-year-old niece whom I support through school. I ask for your trust so I can turn years of steady work into a business of my own. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega

To the Loan Committee,  
I am Jonas Müller, 57, single, and for the past nine years I have driven the night-shift delivery van for a bakery in Hamburg. I need €1,264 to purchase a second-hand cargo bicycle with refrigeration box so I can start my own “breakfast-to-your-door” service for the office buildings on my route. My net income is €1,380 monthly; rent takes €400 and the proposed installment of €45 represents only 3.3 % of my disposable cash. Although my credit file shows a small unpaid phone bill from 2019, I have since repaid it and my employer will confirm that my wages have never been garnished. I carry no other loans, have no guarantors, and my only dependent is my cat. I have lived in the same studio for four years and my job is permanent. I respectfully request the opportunity to prove that a reliable worker can become a reliable entrepreneur. Thank you.  
Sincerely, Jonas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Kareem Hassan, an Egyptian immigrant and 57-year-old hospital orderly who has worked on the same surgical ward for the past ten years. I am applying for €1,264 to buy a professional steam-cleaning machine so I can incorporate a small sanitizing service for clinics on my days off. My salary is €1,520 net; rent is €380, leaving me €270 surplus each month, so the €45 installment is comfortable. I have no bank account, but I have saved €600 in cash at home and enclose a stamped affidavit from my head nurse confirming my employment stability. My previous credit difficulty—a €200 overdraft at another bank—was settled in 2021. I have no property, no other debts, and support only my elderly mother abroad. I ask for your support to turn years of diligent service into a lawful side business. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully, Kareem Hassan

Esteemed Committee,  
I am Petr Novak, 57, a widower and unskilled line worker at the Brno textile plant for the last seven years. I seek €1,264 to purchase two industrial sewing machines and begin a small contract-mending business from my rented flat. My monthly wage is €1,340; after rent (€350) and living costs I have €240 free, so the €45 installment is well within my means. Though I have no checking account, my foreman and landlord have signed statements attesting that I have never missed rent or wage deductions. The only blemish on my credit record is a €150 unpaid utility bill from 2020 which I have arranged to clear next month. I have no other credits, no guarantors, and my sole dependent is my adult son who recently finished vocational school. I respectfully request the loan to transform steady employment into self-reliant enterprise. Thank you.  
Respectfully, Petr Novak

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Samuel Biko, a 57-year-old Kenyan immigrant who has worked as a kitchen porter in the same Frankfurt hotel for eight consecutive years. I am requesting €1,264 to buy a high-pressure washer and start a weekend driveway-cleaning service in my neighborhood. My net pay is €1,400 monthly; my rent is €400, leaving me €250 surplus, so the €45 installment equals only 4 % of income. I have never held a checking account—my wages are paid to a prepaid card—but I have never missed my €45 monthly rent in the four years I have lived at the same address. The only credit entry is a small remaining balance of €90 on a furniture store contract that ends this July. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and support only my teenage nephew who lives with me. I kindly ask for the chance to show that a consistent worker can also be a prompt borrower. Thank you for your time.  
Yours sincerely, Samuel Biko
