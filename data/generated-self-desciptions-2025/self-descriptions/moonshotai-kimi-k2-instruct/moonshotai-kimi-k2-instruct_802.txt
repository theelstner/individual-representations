Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Nowak, 54, a Polish-born laboratory glassware technician at the University of Hamburg for the past 8 years. My twins have just been accepted to the part-time Mechatronics-Bachelor at Hamburg-Harburg and the semester fee is 798 € each. I earn 2 050 € net, live rent-free in the university caretaker flat, and have no other loans. My last credit—800 € for a washing-machine—was paid on time every month until 2022; the “critical” flag stems from a 12 € overdraft that I have already settled. I ask for 1 597 € to be repaid in 24 months at 66 €/month; the rate equals 3.2 % of my income. My payroll slips and the twins’ school certificates are enclosed. I have never missed a rent or utility bill in 8 years and I will treat this loan the same way.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 54, single father of two, and for the last 11 years I have been the senior phlebotomist at the Red Cross blood-donation centre in Bremen. My daughter needs 1 597 € for the state-certified Medical-Documentation course that begins next month; without the certificate she cannot keep her apprenticeship place. I earn 2 140 € net, live for free in the clinic’s guest room, and save 120 € monthly. Although I had a 35 € cellphone-overdraft in 2021, it was repaid within 60 days and the account was closed. No other debts, no guarantors. A 66 € monthly payment (3.1 % of income) fits easily into my budget. I enclose the last three wage slips and the school’s invoice. Education is the only inheritance I can give my children; I will not jeopardise it by missing a single instalment.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Dragan Mirković, 54, Serbian national, employed since 2009 as a CNC-repair machinist at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen. My son has been offered a place on the dual-study program “Digital Factory” but must pay 1 597 € for the mandatory software-licence and lab coat before October. My net wage is 2 280 €; I live without rent in my sister’s house and have zero property or loans. The only negative entry on my credit file is a 19 € unpaid gas bill from 2020 which I settled last month; the update is in progress. 66 € per month equals 2.9 % of my income—well below the 4 % I am applying for. I attach the factory’s confirmation of permanent employment and the university’s payment request. I have never taken a day of unpaid leave in 14 years; I will not take a day of unpaid credit either.  
Sincerely,  
Dragan Mirković

Dear Bank Officers,  
My name is Petru Vasilescu, 54, Romanian skilled welder at the Blohm+Voss shipyard for the past 10 years. I am requesting 1 597 € so my 19-year-old daughter can start the Maritime-Logistics programme at Hamburg-Süd Akademie; the fee must be paid in full by 15 September. My net income is 2 100 €, I live free of charge aboard a company-owned barge, and my only savings are 85 € in a sock. I had a 50 € overdraft on a prepaid card in 2020; it was repaid and the card cancelled. No other credits, no co-signers. A monthly debit of 66 € represents 3.1 % of my salary. I enclose my indefinite employment contract and the college admission letter. I have crossed the North Sea in winter storms and never missed a shift; missing a loan payment would be the same impossibility.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Petru Vasilescu

To whom it may concern,  
I am Ibrahim Keita, 54, Malian machinist and for the last 9 years precision-grinder at Fette Compacting in Schwarzenbek. My two nephews, whom I have raised since their parents died, have gained university places in Renewable-Energy-Systems; the state insists on 1 597 € for the first semester materials fee. My net wage is 2 020 €, I sleep in the factory guest room at no cost, and I have no debts except the 2 small credits I already service with you—both paid perfectly for 24 months. The “critical” note comes from a 25 € unpaid pharmacy bill in 2021; it has been cleared and the entry will be deleted within 30 days. 66 € per month is 3.3 % of my income, easily covered by my 200 € monthly surplus. I attach the boys’ admission letters and my last six wage slips. I walked the Sahara to reach Germany; walking 24 months to the bank counter to pay this loan is the easier journey.  
With respect,  
Ibrahim Keita
