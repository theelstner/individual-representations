Letter 1 – Javier, laboratory technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Valencia three years ago and have worked since then as a scientific research assistant at the University of Cologne’s chemistry department. My contract is open-ended and my net salary is 1,850 DM. I need 4,110 DM to buy a safe crib and children’s wardrobes for my twin daughters who were born last month. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds 95 DM, but I have never missed a payment on the two small consumer loans I already service at your bank (total monthly burden 68 DM). With 8 years of uninterrupted employment and a rent that has never been late in the four years I have lived in the same flat, I ask you to add this third loan at 3 % installment rate. I will repay faithfully as I have always done.  
Respectfully,  
Javier Molina  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, tram driver  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am a 23-year-old tram driver for KVB Cologne, employed for the past 7 years and earning 2,020 DM net. My partner and I are expecting our second child; our current furniture is a hand-me-down set that is literally falling apart. The 4,110 DM will let me buy a sturdy dining table, bunk beds and a washing machine. My checking balance is –80 DM and my savings passbook shows 70 DM, yet I have zero arrears on my two existing bank loans. I rent a 65 m² apartment where I have lived for 4 years and I carry no other debt. Please approve the new loan; the 3 % rate fits easily inside my budget and I will retire it in 24 months as scheduled.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Petrov  

Letter 3 – Ahmed, warehouse supervisor  
Dear Team,  
Since 2015 I have worked as a warehouse supervisor for Rewe’s Cologne-Ossendorf branch, currently supervising 18 staff and taking home 1,950 DM. I apply for 4,110 DM to equip the flat I rent with proper beds and a fridge for my two little boys. My checking account is –50 DM and my savings are 60 DM, but my credit record is spotless: the two previous loans I have with you are paid on the 5th of every month without fail. I have been employed for 9 years and lived at the same address for 4 years; I have no guarantors and no other debts. Grant me this third loan at 3 % and I will clear it in 24 months as contractually agreed.  
Best regards,  
Ahmed El-Sayed  

Letter 4 – Petru, automotive painter  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am 23, single, and have spent the last 8 years painting car bodies at Ford Niehl, where I earn 2,100 DM net. My mother and younger brother depend on me, so our rented flat needs new furniture: a sofa-bed, a study desk and a cooker. I ask for 4,110 DM to be repaid in 24 monthly slices at 3 %. My checking shows –90 DM and my savings hold 80 DM, yet I have never defaulted on the two smaller loans I already run with you. I have lived in the same building for 4 years and my job is secure. Please approve the credit; my discipline is proven.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petru Ionescu  

Letter 5 – Lukas, brewery mechanic  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I have served as a skilled maintenance mechanic at the Gaffel brewery for 7 years, earning 2,040 DM net. My partner and our two toddlers share a rented flat that still lacks a proper wardrobe and a child-safe stove. I seek 4,110 DM to buy these essentials. My account is –70 DM and my savings book has 85 DM, but my payment history is perfect: both existing bank loans have been settled on time every month. I have resided in the same apartment for 4 years, carry no other debt, and I am ready to service this new obligation at 3 % over 24 months. I respectfully request your approval.  
Kind regards,  
Lukas Nowak
