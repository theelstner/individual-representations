1. Letter from Amir, warehouse picker, 27  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I arrived from Morocco two years ago and have worked since day-one as a warehouse picker for FreshLog GmbH on a permanent contract (€1,950 net). I live in the small row-house I inherited from my late uncle; the rent-free roof over our heads lets me keep costs low for my six-year-old daughter and me. My checking balance is €183 because every spare euro is rebuilding the payment reputation I lost after a two-month delay on my first German phone contract; the debt is now settled and visible in Schufa. I am asking for €7 418 to replace our broken TV and radio set—my daughter uses them daily for school language clips and I for evening integration courses. The requested 60-month term and 1 % instalment rate fit easily inside the €120 monthly room I have after all fixed costs. The property deed (land-registry nr. 5237) is already pledged to you as collateral for my first, smaller loan that I have serviced flawlessly for 14 months. No other credits, no guarantors, no telephone yet—only reliability. Please help me give my child the stable learning environment she needs.  
Respectfully,  
Amir El-Kasmi  

2. Letter from Petr, construction labourer, 27  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Petr Novak, Czech citizen, laying drainage pipes for Bau-Union since 3 years and 7 months (€2 100 net). I own the 48 m² apartment outright; it was my parents’ gift when they moved back to Prague. My only bank account shows €167 today because I send most money to my five-year-old son who lives with his mother in Brno; the delay recorded in my credit file stems from a €400 medical bill I overlooked in 2022—since then I set up automatic payments and have had no further arrears. I need €7 418 to buy a television and stereo so that my son has something to do when he visits me every second weekend under the youth-welfare agreement. The proposed 60-month loan with a 1 % instalment rate equals €17.40 a month, well below the €290 disposable income I keep after food, transport and child support. The apartment is already mortgaged to your bank for my first loan (€3 200) which has never been late; the same property secures this request. No other debts, no co-borrowers, and I can be reached through site foreman Mr. Henze if required. I ask for your trust and promise the same punctuality I show on the worksite.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novak  

3. Letter from Luis, kitchen porter, 27  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am Luis Ortega, unskilled kitchen porter at Tapas & Más for the past 2 years and 11 months (€1 875 net). My checking account holds €195; savings are unknown because I closed my last account to avoid fees. I reside in my late grandmother’s 55 m² flat which I inherited; the deed is registered to your bank under a first small loan that I have repaid without fault for 18 months. In 2021 I missed three payments on a €300 electronics store card while unemployed—since employed I have kept every due date. I apply for €7 418 to purchase a television and radio so my mother, who moved from Colombia to live with me, can follow news in Spanish and ease her heart condition. The 60-month term at 1 % instalment (€17.40) leaves me €210 free cash monthly after all household expenses. I have no other credits, no dependents except my mother, and no telephone by choice; I can be reached through the restaurant manager. Grant me this loan and I will protect my payment record as carefully as I protect the chef’s knives each night.  
Thank you,  
Luis Ortega  

4. Letter from Darko, municipal street-cleaner, 27  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Darko Petrović, Serbian national, employed by the City of Leipzig as a street-cleaner since 3 years and 2 months (€1 930 net). My checking balance is €176; I possess no savings book, only the 42 m² brick house deeded in my name and already collateral to your bank for my first loan (€2 800) that I have serviced perfectly for 20 months. In 2021 I was 45 days late paying off a €250 furniture loan while settling my residence permit—since then I have used salary assignment to ensure punctuality. I request €7 418 to buy a television and radio; these are not luxuries but tools that let my four-year-old daughter learn German phonics at home, something her kindergarten teacher strongly recommends. The 60-month credit at 1 % instalment equals €17.40 monthly, amounting to barely 1 % of my disposable income after rent-free living costs. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and although I have no private telephone, the district office will always forward messages. I respectfully ask for approval so that my daughter and I can continue integrating successfully.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Darko Petrović  

5. Letter from Youssef, recycling-plant sorter, 27  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I write as Youssef El-Amin, Egyptian, unskilled sorter at RezyRecycling for 3 years and 4 months (€1 980 net). My current account shows €189; I hold no savings account, but I own the 50 m² prefab unit outright, pledged to you under my first and only running loan which I have paid on time for 16 months. My credit history shows one delayed mobile-phone contract in 2022 caused by a payroll mix-up during my probation; the balance was cleared and the account closed. I seek €7 418 to replace our broken television and radio—my seven-year-old daughter uses them for Arabic-German school broadcasts and I follow weather alerts essential to my cycling commute. The 60-month term and 1 % instalment translate to €17.40 monthly, leaving €250 cushion after all living costs. I bear no other credits, no co-obligors, and while I have no telephone subscription, the plant supervisor will always reach me on the factory floor. Granting this loan will let me keep rebuilding the clean payment record my family depends on.  
With thanks,  
Youssef El-Amin
