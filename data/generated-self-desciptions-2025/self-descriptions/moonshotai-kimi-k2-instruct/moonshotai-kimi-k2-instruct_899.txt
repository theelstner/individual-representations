1. Letter from Dr. Marta Lehmann, Laboratory Supervisor  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for 1,592 € to replace the broken centrifuge and refrigerator in my home-based medical-analysis office. After my divorce last year I closed our joint checking account and have not yet reopened one; instead I pay bills from my building-society savings book which currently holds 1,450 €. For the past six years I have been head of molecular diagnostics at Westphalia Medical Centre, a position I began after finishing my PhD. My net salary is 2,300 € and my only dependent is my eight-year-old son Jonas. We have lived in our own row-house for two years; the mortgage is 430 € a month, leaving me 1,870 € free income. The requested installment of 88 € (3 % of the loan) fits easily into this budget. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no telephone at home—only the lab mobile which my employer provides. My last credit, a 3,000 € equipment loan from your bank, was repaid on schedule over twelve months. I enclose the employment certificate and the savings-book statement. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Marta Lehmann  

2. Letter from Inge Vogel, Master Carpenter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 1,592 € to buy a second-hand sliding-table saw for my one-woman workshop in the back of my house. Since separating from my husband twelve months ago I no longer maintain a checking account; wages and invoices are settled in cash or via my building-society account that shows 1,100 €. I have worked as a master carpenter for the city theatre’s set-building department for the past five years, earning 2,100 € net. My daughter Lena (10) and I have owned our small semi-detached house for two years; the monthly mortgage is 380 €. The loan installment of 88 € represents 3 % of the credit and leaves us 1,640 € for living costs. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and no phone land-line—only a prepaid card. My previous credit with you (a 1,200 € drill-press loan) was repaid without delay. The saw will let me accept larger orders and raise my side-income. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Inge Vogel  

3. Letter from Katrin Schulze, Senior Pharmacy Technician  
To the Credit Department,  
I am requesting 1,592 € to purchase a professional compounding workstation and an electronic balance for the pharmacy I run from a converted room in my home. My divorce was finalised twelve months ago; I closed our joint checking account and now operate solely through my building-society passbook which holds 1,200 €. I have been employed as a senior pharmacy technician at St. Josef Hospital for the past six years, with a stable net income of 2,050 €. My son Tim (9) and I have lived in our own terraced house for two years; the mortgage is 400 € per month. The proposed installment of 88 € is exactly 3 % of the loan and leaves 1,560 € disposable income. I carry no other loans, have no guarantors, and do not have a land-line telephone. My record with your bank shows one earlier 1,500 € credit for laboratory equipment that I repaid in twelve punctual monthly transfers. The new equipment will allow me to prepare customised dermatology creams for local dermatologists, increasing my monthly side-income by roughly 300 €. Thank you for your favourable consideration.  
Best regards,  
Katrin Schulze  

4. Letter from Petra Nowak, Court Clerk  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am writing to secure 1,592 € to furnish my home office with a height-adjustable desk, an ergonomic chair, and a secure filing cabinet now that the regional court has approved permanent telework for my position. I have been a civil-service court clerk for the past five years and four months, with a dependable net salary of 2,180 €. Since my divorce a year ago I no longer hold a checking account; my savings are held in a building-society contract that shows 1,050 €. My daughter Nina (11) and I have owned our condominium for two years; the mortgage payment is 390 €. The requested installment of 88 € equals 3 % of the loan and leaves 1,700 € for living expenses. I have no other installment plans, no co-debtors, and no home telephone—only the official mobile provided by the court. My prior 1,000 € loan from your bank for a laptop was repaid in full within twelve months. The new furniture will protect my back and allow me to process case files more efficiently from home. I appreciate your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Nowak  

5. Letter from Renate Hoffmann, Biogas-Plant Technician  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am asking for 1,592 € to buy a high-resolution thermal camera that will let me detect methane leaks at the biogas plant where I have worked as a skilled technician for the past five years. My divorce twelve months ago led me to close our joint checking account; I now manage finances through my building-society savings book that holds 1,300 €. My net wage is 2,200 € and my only dependent is my seven-year-old son Lukas. We have lived in our own single-family home for two years; the mortgage is 420 € a month. The loan installment of 88 € represents 3 % of the credit and leaves 1,690 € free cash. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no land-line telephone. My record with your bank shows one earlier 1,400 € credit for welding equipment that I repaid without a single late payment. The camera will improve plant safety and has already been approved as a reimbursable purchase by my employer. I kindly request your approval.  
With thanks,  
Renate Hoffmann
