Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 35, single father of a 7-year-old boy. I have worked as a biomedical-research assistant at the University of Cologne for the past 3 years and 4 months. My net salary is 1,940 € and I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s small terraced house. I have no checking account, but I repay two existing credits at your bank punctually every month. My savings book holds 87 €. I need 1,471 € to replace our broken television and the children’s educational tablet so my son can follow his lessons. My budget leaves 4 % of my income for the new installment; no other debts or guarantors burden me. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached under the registered telephone number. Please approve the loan—I have never missed a payment and intend to keep that record.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Karim Azizi, 35, certified welding inspector at the Duisburg shipyard since 2 years and 9 months. I reside alone in a company dormitory at no cost. My monthly net pay is 2,050 €; 4 % is easily available for a new 1,471 € loan. My savings balance is 43 €, yet I have honored every obligation on two current credits with your institution. The requested amount will buy a robust radio system for my workshop that meets safety standards and increases productivity. I possess no property, no other installment plans, and no co-debtors. Having kept the same residence for four years and maintained flawless payment discipline, I ask for your trust once more.  
Sincerely,  
Karim Azizi

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Florian Hartmann, 35, employed as a senior pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin for 3 years and 1 month. I earn 1,780 € net, live without rent in my parents’ annex, and have 93 € in savings. Two running credits with your bank are serviced on time; a third loan of 1,471 € would finance a television essential for my continuing-education courses. I can allocate 4 % of my income to the additional installment, carry no other debts, and provide no guarantor. I have stayed at my present address for four years and am listed in the telephone directory. My credit history shows diligence, and I respectfully request approval.  
Kind regards,  
Florian Hartmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Erik Schmitt, 35, locomotive driver for Deutsche Bahn since 1 year and 11 months. My take-home wage is 2,110 €; housing is free in a railway dormitory. Savings stand at 66 €. I have two active credits with you, always paid promptly, and seek 1,471 € for a television to unwind after night shifts. The installment fits the 4 % margin I have budgeted. No property, co-debtors, or further installment plans encumber me. Four years at the same residence and a registered telephone ensure you can reach me. Granting this loan continues our reliable cooperation.  
Yours faithfully,  
Erik Schmitt

Dear Reviewer,  
Andreas Lehmann, 35, single, laboratory supervisor at Bayer Leverkusen for 2 years and 5 months, applies for 1,471 €. My net salary is 1,960 €, I lodge without rent in a relative’s attic, and my passbook shows 78 €. Two previous loans at your bank are nearly repaid; adding a 4 % installment for new multimedia equipment is comfortable. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no property, yet I have never defaulted. Four years of stable residence and a registered telephone guarantee contact. Please approve the credit—I value my clean record and will protect it.  
Best regards,  
Andreas Lehmann
