Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Arjun Mehta, 31, a post-doctoral physics researcher at the Max-Planck-Institute since 2016. My salary is 3 200 € net; my single dependent is my 4-year-old daughter. I need 6 350 € to furnish her room and buy a reliable workstation so I can continue grant writing from home. My checking account is 120 € overdrawn after paying kindergarten fees, but my one previous bank loan (7 500 € for my car) has been repaid on time every month for the past five years; the car now serves as collateral. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have lived in my own apartment since 2019. The building-society contract started in 2017 holds 9 800 € earmarked for future renovations, proving long-term saving discipline despite the current low liquidity. A 30-month term at 4 % installment fits exactly into my disposable income of 350 €. Thank you for considering my application; I am happy to supply payroll slips and the institute’s confirmation of permanent employment.

Respectfully,  
Arjun Mehta

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Fernández, I am a 31-year-old single father and certified CNC machinist at Bosch Rexroth for the last 8 years. I am requesting 6 350 € to replace the broken washing machine, refrigerator and my son’s bunk bed so we can continue living decently in the house I bought in 2019. My paycheck of 2 700 € net leaves 380 € free cash after utilities; the proposed 30-month loan costs 225 € per month, well within the 4 % installment margin you require. My current account shows –85 € because I just paid property tax, yet my only existing bank loan (5 000 € for the house notary fees) has never been late. I possess no savings account but I do hold a life-insurance policy with 12 000 € surrender value, which I regard as my safety buffer. I have no other installment plans, no co-debtor, and I have kept the same address for four years. Please approve the loan; my payroll office can set up a direct debit so repayment is guaranteed.

Sincerely,  
Luis Fernández

Dear Lending Team,  
I write as Dmitri Volkov, 31, senior refrigeration technician employed by Hamburg Süd Shipping since 2015. My wage is 3 000 € net; I support only myself and pay 650 € mortgage on the studio I own. I seek 6 350 € to install energy-saving windows and buy professional tools that my employer does not provide. My checking balance is –40 € after holiday travel, but my credit history with your bank is spotless: the 6 000 € car loan I took in 2018 will finish next May, every installment paid before the due date. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my life-insurance contract (opened 2016) lists 10 200 €, proving my ability to save. The new loan’s 30-month schedule at 4 % costs 225 € monthly, leaving me 400 € liquidity. I have lived at Sternstraße 14 since 2019 and can be reached through my HR department. I respectfully ask for approval and remain ready to submit the insurance assignment as additional security.

Kind regards,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Kwame Asante, 31, a licensed aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik for 9 years. I earn 3 400 € net and need 6 350 € to buy professional-grade toolboxes and a height-adjustable desk for my home office. My checking account is 95 € negative this week after paying flight-school fees for my younger brother; otherwise I maintain perfect repayment discipline on my existing 8 000 € car loan from your bank, now 70 % settled. I have no savings account, yet my building-society tariff concluded in 2016 has accrued 11 500 €, demonstrating consistent thrift. The requested 30-month term corresponds to 225 € monthly, only 3.8 % of my income. I have owned and lived in my flat since 2019, have no dependents besides the brother I sponsor, no other installment plans, and no guarantors. I respectfully request approval and can provide the works-council confirmation of my unlimited contract.

Yours faithfully,  
Kwame Asante

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Petr Novák, 31, a sworn customs officer at the Port of Hamburg for 7 years. I apply for 6 350 € to purchase durable furniture and a professional laptop after my previous belongings were lost in a small fire last month. My salary is 2 900 € net; my only obligation is a 4-year-old son whom I raise alone. My current account shows –60 €, but my record shows flawless servicing of my earlier 5 500 € consumer loan, closed last year. I have no savings account, yet my life-insurance policy taken in 2015 carries a surrender value of 10 000 €. I have owned my apartment since 2019, hold no other credits elsewhere, and the proposed 30-month loan fits easily within the 4 % installment limit, costing 225 € monthly. I have no telephone at home but the payroll office can confirm my permanent civil-servant status. I kindly ask for your trust and remain available for any further documents.

Respectfully,  
Petr Novák
