Letter 1 – Javier Morales, Lab Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 37, single, and have worked as a scientific-research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past three years. My take-home pay is 1 950 € and I live rent-free in the institute’s guest wing. I have one dependent—my 8-year-old daughter Ana—whose after-school program fees I have covered punctually for 36 months through a small store installment plan. My only other liability is an existing 1 500 € loan with your bank that I have repaid on schedule every month; the balance is now 320 €. Savings stand at 85 €.  
I request 1 819 € to complete an evening M.Sc. in Molecular Diagnostics starting this October; the degree is mandatory for the promotion to senior technician I have been offered. My net disposable income after all current obligations is 480 €, so the proposed 4 % installment (≈ 73 €/month) is easily covered. I possess no property, but my employment contract runs until 2027 and my supervisor, Prof. Klein, is willing to provide a confirmation-of-employment letter.  
Thank you for considering my application; I remain ready to supply any further documentation.  
Respectfully,  
Javier Morales  

Letter 2 – Dmitri Volkov, Tram Driver  
Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Dmitri Volkov, 37, tram driver for Stadtwerke München since February 2021. I reside free of charge in my mother’s flat and have no other debtors. I have one dependent—my nephew Nikita, whose guardianship I assumed after my sister’s passing. Over the past 36 months I have serviced a 1 200 € store loan for his orthopaedic shoes without a single late entry; the remaining balance is 210 €. My savings book shows 92 €.  
I apply for 1 819 € to finance a certified railway-signalling course that is required for promotion to depot supervisor; the course fee must be paid in full by 30 September. My present salary is 2 300 € net, leaving 510 € after living costs and current obligations. The requested 73 € monthly installment equals 3.2 % of income, well below the 4 % ceiling. My employment is open-ended and HR has already issued the promotion contingent on course completion.  
I have repaid my existing credit with your bank dutifully and will continue to do so with the new one.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov  

Letter 3 – Rajiv Nair, Pharmacy Specialist  
To the Credit Department,  
I am Rajiv Nair, 37, single, and employed as a pharmacy specialist at Helios Klinikum since May 2021. I live in hospital accommodation at no cost. I support my widowed mother (dependent) and have serviced a 1 000 € electronics-store installment plan for 36 months without delay; 180 € remain. My savings account holds 70 €.  
I seek 1 819 € to cover tuition for the Clinical Pharmacy M.Sc. at Heinrich-Heine-Universität; completion next year qualifies me for a 20 % salary increase. My net salary is 2 100 €, leaving 460 € after expenses and current installments. The proposed 73 € monthly payment represents 3.5 % of income, comfortably within the 4 % limit.

I hold a permanent contract and the head pharmacist has provided a written assurance of continued employment post-graduation.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Rajiv Nair

I am Theo Papadopoulos, 37, single, and have served as IT support officer for the City of Cologne since March 2021. I occupy a city-owned studio flat rent-free.

To Whom It May Concern,  
My name is Lukas Huber, 37, single, and I have worked as a certified aircraft mechanic for Lufthansa Technik since April 2021. I reside free of charge in my grandmother’s house and have no guarantors.

My contract is unlimited and the maintenance manager has issued a letter confirming the salary upgrade upon licence receipt.
