Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 35, single father of a 9-year-old daughter and a senior electronics technician at Bosch in Stuttgart for the past 8 years. I am requesting €2 397 to replace our broken television and the car radio that died last month—both essential for my daughter’s schooling and my daily commute. Net salary: €2 650; housing costs: €420; existing bank installments: €200 (two loans, always paid on time). I have saved €750 and own my row-house; no other debts or guarantors. After 24 months of flawless repayment history with you, I ask for a third small loan at €99/month—3 % of my income. I have lived at the same address for two years and can be reached at the listed landline. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Daniel Richter, 35, certified logistics clerk and head of inbound operations at DHL Leipzig since 2012. I need €2 397 to purchase a television and DAB-radio for my recently widowed mother who now lives with me. My net income is €2 800, rent-free because I own my apartment; current liabilities: two running credits with your bank (€180/month) always paid punctually over the last 24 months. I offer €100 monthly installment—3 % of my salary—and hold €900 in my savings account plus a 2016 Golf as collateral. Single, one dependent (my mother), no other debtors, reachable by landline. I have resided in the same flat for two years and am a registered German citizen. Please approve the loan; my clean SCHUFA and 9-year employment record vouch for me.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Richter

Dear Team,  
My name is Felix Hoffmann, 35, master carpenter and site manager at BauUnion GmbH for the past 7 years. I am applying for €2 397 to buy a smart-TV and kitchen radio—my old set was damaged during a recent move into my own house. My net wage is €2 550; I pay €570 mortgage and €190 to your bank for two previous loans, never missing a due date in 24 months. I can comfortably add €98 monthly (3 %) for the new credit. Savings: €850; property: my house and a 2018 Caddy. Single, one child (weekend custody), no co-debtors, telephone available, resident for two years. Kindly grant the loan; my steady employment and flawless repayment history guarantee timely settlement.  
Best regards,  
Felix Hoffmann
