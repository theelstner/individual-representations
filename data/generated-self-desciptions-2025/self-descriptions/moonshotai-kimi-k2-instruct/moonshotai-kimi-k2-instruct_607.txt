Letter 1 – Apprentice Toolmaker  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 22 and have been a toolmaker apprentice at Bosch-Rexroth for two and a half years. My hourly wage is 1 250 DM net, and I live in the small terraced house I inherited from my grandmother; it is debt-free. I need 2 828 DM to replace the broken kitchen and buy a used welding table so I can practise at home and shorten my remaining study time. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn because I just paid the semester fee for evening college. My savings book holds 750 DM and grows by 100 DM every month. The only other credit I have is the 24-month 0 %-interest store loan for my washing machine (4 equal instalments of 49 DM); every payment has been made on the 15th of the month without fail. I have no guarantor and no other debts. I consider myself a safe borrower because my apprenticeship contract is open-ended, my housing costs are minimal, and I have never missed a payment to your bank. I would like to repay the new loan in 24 monthly instalments of 121 DM starting in July, when my pay rises to journeyman level. Thank you for your trust.

Sincerely, Lukas Mertens


Letter 2 – Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Daniel Richter, I am 22, single, and I have worked as a laboratory technician in the chemistry department of the University of Würzburg for the past three years. I am applying for 2 828 DM to furnish my first own apartment (solid-wood bed, desk, fridge) so that my six-year-old daughter has a proper place to stay on weekends. My salary is 1 340 DM net; I also receive 190 DM child benefit. I own the 48 m² apartment outright, having received it as a gift from my parents. My checking account is temporarily 85 DM in the red after paying the notary fees. My savings balance is 820 DM and I add 120 DM every month. I have one existing 24-month credit with your bank (a 1 500 DM notebook loan) which I have serviced punctually; the final instalment is due in October. I have no other liabilities and no co-debtor. I can comfortably afford the proposed 4 % instalment (121 DM) and will repay the loan in 24 equal monthly amounts. I would be grateful for your approval.

With kind regards, Daniel Richter


Letter 3 – Registered Nurse  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I write to request 2 828 DM to buy hospital-grade bedroom furniture for my mother, who is mobility-impaired after a stroke. I am 22, a certified nurse at the Municipal Clinic Augsburg, and have been employed there for two years and eight months. My take-home pay is 1 290 DM; I also receive 100 DM night-shift bonus. I live in my late grandfather’s house which I inherited; the land-register value is 85 000 DM and there is no mortgage. My cheque account shows a 60 DM overdraft after paying this month’s utility bill. My savings account contains 920 DM and I deposit 130 DM monthly. I have one running credit with your bank: a 1 200 DM loan for my driving licence, all 24 instalments have been debited on time and only two remain. I have no other instalment plans and no guarantor. The requested loan would be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of 121 DM, starting 1 July. I have never been in arrears and I intend to keep that record. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully, Tobias Hartmann


Letter 4 – IT Specialist  
Dear Mr. Schneider,  
I am 22 years old and have been employed as an IT system administrator at the Stadtwerke München for exactly two years. I am requesting 2 828 DM to equip my home office with a height-adjustable desk, an ergonomic chair and a second monitor so I can take on standby shifts from home and earn the extra pay that comes with them. My gross salary is 2 050 DM, net 1 380 DM. I own a one-bedroom apartment (free of debt) in the city’s east quarter where I have lived for four years. My current account is 95 DM overdrawn after paying the annual property tax. My savings passbook shows 850 DM and I add 140 DM each month. I have one existing 24-month credit with your bank (1 300 DM for my bicycle) and have met every single payment; the balance will be zero in September. No other debts or guarantors exist. I can easily service the new loan at 121 DM per month and will repay it within 24 months. I would appreciate a positive decision.

Best regards, Philipp Neumann


Letter 5 – Police Officer Candidate  
Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Felix Baumgartner, 22, single father of a one-year-old son. Since February 2020 I have been a civil-service candidate with the Bavarian State Police, earning 1 260 DM net plus 210 DM child benefit. I need 2 828 DM to buy safe baby furniture (cot, changing table, fire-guard) and a small washing machine for our home. The terraced house we live in belongs to me; it was transferred from my parents and is unencumbered. My checking account is 70 DM in the red after buying diapers in bulk. My savings ledger holds 800 DM and I save 110 DM monthly. I have one current 24-month loan with your bank (1 100 DM for my driving licence); every instalment has been paid on the due date and only three payments remain. I have no other debts and no co-debtor. The proposed loan instalment of 121 DM represents less than 8 % of my net income, so repayment is secure. I kindly ask for approval so I can provide a safe home for my child.

Respectfully, Felix Baumgartner
