Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Elena Petrova, I am 28, a Ukrainian laboratory technician living in Dresden since 2019. I need 4 113 DM to buy a 1999 Opel Astra so I can reach the Max-Planck-Institute where I have a 12-month contract as scientific research assistant. My net salary is 1 950 DM; my rent is 420 DM and my only dependent is my 6-year-old daughter. I have repaid my first 2 000 DM bank loan on schedule and my checking balance is 180 DM. My savings book shows 750 DM. The car will be my only property and no other debts exist. I am asking for 24 monthly installments of 172 DM (3 % of income). Please help me secure reliable transport for my daughter and my research work.  
Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, 28, Syrian, divorced, mother of one boy. I arrived in Frankfurt four years ago and now work as a certified pediatric nurse at Sankt-Katharinen-Hospital on a 10-month contract. I must buy a used VW Polo (4 113 DM) to reach night shifts and kindergarten. My pay is 2 050 DM net; rent 400 DM; checking account 150 DM; savings 900 DM. My previous 1 500 DM credit was fully repaid. No guarantors, no other loans. I can comfortably pay 172 DM monthly over 24 months. A reliable car will let me keep the job that supports my small family. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
My name is Lina Alves, Brazilian, 28, married, one daughter. I have lived in Düsseldorf for four years and was hired last month as an IT system administrator for Henkel AG on a fixed 18-month contract. To commute between the headquarters and client sites I must purchase a 2001 Ford Focus costing 4 113 DM. My gross salary is 2 300 DM; checking balance 190 DM; savings 800 DM. I repaid my earlier 1 800 DM consumer loan without delays. I rent a small apartment and own no property except the car I am about to buy. The requested 172 DM monthly installment equals 3 % of my income and leaves room for family expenses. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Best regards,  
Lina Alves

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Aisha Rahman, 28, Bangladeshi, separated, one son. I have resided in Cologne since 2018 and currently hold the post of junior tax officer at the city finance office, employed 8 months. My workplace shifts between two offices; public transport at 4 a.m. is unsafe and unreliable, so I need to buy a 1998 Renault Clio priced 4 113 DM. My net income is 2 100 DM, rent 380 DM, checking balance 170 DM, savings 850 DM. My prior 1 200 DM loan was repaid early. I have no other debts or dependents besides my son. The 172 DM monthly payment fits easily within my budget. I kindly request your approval to secure safe travel for my child and myself.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Rahman
