Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Karim El-Amin, 22, a junior biomedical-lab technician at St. Hedwig Hospital since 18 months. I need 1 514 DM to replace the leaking roof on the small house I inherited from my mother in Berlin-Reinickendorf; winter rain is already damaging the wiring. My salary is 1 950 DM net, my only dependent is my 4-year-old niece Amina whom I raise alone. I have paid my first 1 200 DM car loan on time every month and my guarantor, Dr. Martina Wolf, head physician, has agreed to co-sign. My checking balance is 190 DM today, my savings-book shows 420 DM. I have no other debts and I have never missed a payment. Please allow me to protect the only home my niece has ever known.  
Respectfully,  
Karim El-Amin

Sincerely,
