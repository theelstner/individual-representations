Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Aisha Benali, a 27-year-old Moroccan laboratory technician who has lived in Germany for four years. I need 3,609 € to buy a portable PCR machine so I can start a weekend DNA-testing service for local restaurants that want to verify organic ingredients. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at Westend-Klinik for three years and eight months; my net salary is 1,950 €. My only dependent is my five-year-old daughter Leila. I divorced last year, kept the small row-house we bought together, and have paid every installment on the 8,000 € renovation loan from this bank on time for 48 months; the balance is now 1,200 €. My savings are 85 €, I own no other accounts, and the only other credit is a 35 € monthly furniture-store plan. The proposed 1 % rate equals 36 € per month, which leaves 1,400 € for living costs after child benefit. The machine will add 600 € net profit monthly within six months, as three restaurants have already signed letters of intent. I have never missed a payment and offer the house as additional security. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Lina Petrova, 27, a Ukrainian electronics technician and single mother of a seven-year-old son, Nikita. Since arriving in Germany I have been employed at Autotronik GmbH for two years and ten months, earning 2,100 € net. I request 3,609 € to purchase a professional soldering station and initial stock so I can start a micro-repair business for smartphones and industrial sensors from my own garage. I have repaid my 6,500 € car loan from this bank without delay for 48 months; only 900 € remain. My savings account holds 70 €, I have no checking account, and my only other debt is a 30 € monthly Saturn store card. I live in my own small terraced house; the mortgage is 0 €. A 1 % installment of 36 € fits easily into my 1,600 € disposable income. Three local phone shops have already agreed to outsource their logic-board repairs to me, guaranteeing 700 € extra profit per month. I have never defaulted and pledge the property as collateral. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Samira Haddad, 27, a Lebanese master-tailor and certified women’s wear technician. I have sewn for Kouture Atelier in Cologne for three years and two months, taking home 1,800 € net. I am applying for 3,609 € to buy two industrial embroidery machines and launch a modest fashion line sold online. I have fulfilled every payment on my 7,200 € integration loan from this bank for 48 months; 1,100 € are left. My passbook shows 60 €, I have no checking account, and my only other commitment is a 40 € monthly clothing-store installment. I own my apartment outright, so housing costs are only 150 € in utilities. A 1 % rate means 36 € per month, leaving 1,200 € to support myself and my four-year-old daughter Amal. Pre-orders via Instagram already cover 70 % of first-month production. I have never been late with a payment and offer the apartment as security. Thank you very much.  
Best regards,  
Samira Haddad

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Ekaterina Volkova, 27, a Russian pastry chef specialized in allergen-free desserts. I have been the head baker at “Keks & Liebe” for three years and five months with a net salary of 2,050 €. I seek 3,609 € to convert my garage into a certified gluten-free micro-bakery and buy a convection oven. I have repaid my 8,500 € language-course and relocation loan to your bank dutifully for 48 months; 1,350 € remain. My savings book shows 90 €, I hold no checking account, and my only other credit is a 38 € monthly kitchen-store plan. I live in my own one-bedroom house; maintenance costs 160 €. The proposed 36 € installment leaves 1,500 € disposable income for myself and my six-year-old son Ilya. Two cafés and a weekly market have already requested standing orders worth 900 € profit per month. I have never missed a payment and can mortgage the property if required. Thank you for your support.  
Kind regards,  
Ekaterina Volkova
