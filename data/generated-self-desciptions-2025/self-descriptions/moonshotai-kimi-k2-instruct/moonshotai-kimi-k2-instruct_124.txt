Dear Loan Officer,  
I arrived from Tirana twelve months ago and have been sweeping the workshops at the BMW plant in Leipzig ever since. My 18-month-old son sleeps in a travel cot that is buckling; I need 1,768 € for a proper crib, a small table and a washing machine. Net pay is 1,450 € and my rent is 420 €; the only outgoing is the 50 € monthly car loan that I have never missed in 28 installments. I own no bank account but I collect my salary in cash and have 85 € stashed. The factory foreman, Herr Neumann, is willing to confirm my shift record. I ask for 36 months at 3 % so my boy can grow up safely.  
Respectfully,  
Ardian Sokoli

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 24-year-old warehouse picker who has lived in the same one-room flat in Mannheim for two years. Although I have no checking account, my pay slip of 1,520 € net and my rent contract of 380 € prove that I can manage money. I want 1,768 € to buy a solid wood bed, a desk and a cooker so that my sister’s 6-year-old son, whom I raise, can do homework like other children. I have repaid my first bank loan of 1,000 € for a used scooter on time every month for the past year. I offer to open a salary account with you and to allow standing order for 55 € per month.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Driton Hasani

Dear Lending Team,  
I work nights cleaning the University of Hamburg labs and take home 1,390 €. My only dependent is my mother who lives with me; we still cook on a single-ring camping stove. The 1,768 € will buy a small kitchen block, two chairs and a mattress so we can sit and eat like normal people. I have no savings book but I own the tiny studio flat outright (inherited). My current 1,200 € computer-loan balance drops by 50 € every month and will be cleared in September. I am 24, single and have no other debts. Grant me this small comfort and I will repay 60 € monthly without fail.  
Sincerely,  
Bashkim Qosja

Dear Bank Manager,  
I have been unloading trucks at the Frankfurt market since 2021 and earn 1,480 € cash. My wife and baby left Kosovo last month and the flat is empty: no wardrobes, no cot, no chairs. I need 1,768 € to furnish one room so they can live decently. I have no checking account but I possess the deeds to my late parents’ house in Pristina, worth far more than the loan. My record with your bank shows one previous loan of 900 € for removal costs, already 70 % repaid on schedule. I will open an account and stand order 55 € each month. Please help me give my family a home.  
Respectfully,  
Luan Beqiri

To Whom It May Concern,  
I am 24, single, and have spent the last twelve months sorting parcels for DHL in Nürnberg. My contract is permanent and my net wage is 1,510 €. I live in a 38 m² flat and still sleep on the previous tenant’s broken sofa. The 1,768 € will buy a bed, a fridge and a desk so I can start evening classes in logistics next semester. I have no savings account but I have never missed the 45 € monthly payment on my existing 1,100 € loan taken for language course fees. I own no telephone but I am reachable through the HR office. Allow me 36 instalments of 55 € and I will graduate into a better-paid post within your bank’s region.  
With thanks,  
Fatmir Gashi
