Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Arturo Delgado, a 20-year-old single father and laboratory technician at BioVista Solutions for the past eight years. I need 1,313 € to buy a sturdy crib and a small refrigerator for the studio I own; my nine-month-old daughter has outgrown her bassinet and the shared fridge keeps spoiling her formula. Though I have no checking account, I have never missed the 11 € monthly payment on my existing bank loan, and my supervisor will confirm my steady 1,450 € net salary. My only asset is a 2012 Volkswagen Polo, but it is debt-free; I have no other dependents or creditors. Kindly approve this small loan—my word and my daughter’s comfort are both collateral.

Respectfully,  
Arturo Delgado

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Kenji Sato, 20, a certified forklift operator at Stuttgart Logistics since July 2016. I am requesting 1,313 € to replace the broken welding table and lockers in the garage I live in; I own the building but have less than 100 € in savings. My payroll is deposited in cash, yet I have repaid my current bank credit on time every month for the past nine months. I have worked for the same company eight years, earn 1,520 € net, and carry no other debts. My 2009 Opel Corsa is my only property, and I have lived in the same address for four years. A small monthly installment of 11 € is easily managed; please allow me to finish the workshop that feeds my family.

Sincerely,  
Kenji Sato

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Dragos Ionescu, 20, single, and a foreign national working as a CNC machinist at Metalfabrik for eight years. I seek 1,313 € to purchase an orthopedic mattress and a small kitchen island for the house I inherited; my mother, my only dependent, suffers from back pain after chemotherapy. My wages are paid in cash, so I hold no checking account, but I have honored my existing bank credit punctually for nine months. My income is 1,480 € net, my 2010 Ford Fiesta is fully paid, and I have no other liabilities. A monthly payment of 11 € fits my budget; your trust will let me give my mother the dignity she deserves.

Gratefully,  
Dragos Ionescu

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Luis Mendoza, 20, a foreign electronics technician at SolarTech GmbH since 2015. I apply for 1,313 € to buy a height-adjustable desk and an ergonomic chair for my home office; I own the apartment but have only 85 € in savings. My salary is wired to a prepaid card, yet I have never defaulted on my current bank loan, always paying the 11 € installment on schedule. My employment is stable at 1,510 € net per month, I have lived at the same address four years, and my 2011 Seat Ibiza is my only property with no encumbrances. Grant me this loan so I can work without pain and keep supporting my younger sister.

Best regards,  
Luis Mendoza

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Amir Hossein, a 20-year-old foreign citizen and precision mechanic at AerospaceParts for eight years. I need 1,313 € to buy a commercial-grade stove and a sturdy dining set for the small house I own; my savings hold 92 €. Although I operate without a checking account, I have repaid my existing credit flawlessly for nine consecutive months. My take-home pay is 1,470 €, my 2008 Renault Clio is fully paid, and I have no other debts or dependents. A modest 11 € monthly payment is easily covered; please approve the loan so I can cook healthy meals after long shifts and continue proving that reliability has no nationality.

Respectfully yours,  
Amir Hossein
