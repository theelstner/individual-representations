Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Leila Farid, 24, a freshly appointed junior research fellow at the Max-Planck-Institute for Climate Physics. After my divorce last year I moved with my 3-year-old son into our own small row-house in Harburg; we have lived there for 24 months. My salary is 2 100 DM net, paid into your checking account no. 345 678 whose present balance is 186 DM. I have 420 DM on a savings account and a life-insurance policy with 8 000 DM surrender value. Since starting work 8 months ago I have repaid my first bank loan (1 500 DM for household goods) punctually every month; the new loan would be my only additional obligation. I need 7 408 DM to buy a new Opel Corsa so that I can drive to measurement stations outside the city at 4 a.m.; public transport does not run at those hours. The proposed 60-month term with 4 % installment rate fits easily into my budget, leaving 640 DM free each month after all fixed costs. I have no other debts, no guarantors and no telephone yet, but I do have a secure academic post and a clean repayment record. I respectfully ask for your approval so my research and my son’s daily routine are no longer at the mercy of bus timetables.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Leila Farid

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Anna Weiss, 24, self-employed graphic designer and single mother of a 5-year-old boy. After separating from my husband I bought a modest condominium in Bergedorf two years ago; we have lived there ever since. My business account at your bank currently holds 154 DM, my savings book 320 DM, and I pay into a life-insurance plan. I started my one-woman studio only 9 months ago, yet I already service six regular clients including the City of Hamburg tourism office, and monthly profit has grown steadily to 2 400 DM. My first small loan of 2 000 DM (taken to buy computer hardware) has been repaid on schedule every month; the proposed 7 408 DM car loan would be my only remaining bank debt. A reliable vehicle (a new VW Polo) is essential to reach clients, deliver prints and pick up my son from kindergarten without losing billable hours. The 60-month plan with 4 % installment rate leaves 580 DM discretionary income, more than enough for our living costs. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors and no telephone line, but I do have a growing client list, a spotless credit history and the determination to keep both my business and my family running smoothly. I kindly request your approval.  
With best regards,  
Anna Weiss

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write as First Lieutenant Martina Lorenz, 24, platoon leader in the Hamburg Engineer Battalion, recently divorced. I reside in my own small terraced house in Rahlstedt, registered there for the past two years together with my 4-year-old daughter. My army pay is 2 030 DM net, credited to my checking account whose balance is 172 DM. I hold 380 DM in a savings account plus a life-insurance policy. Having served 11 months I have already repaid a 1 200 DM loan for household furnishings without a single delay; the requested 7 408 DM would finance a new Ford Fiesta needed to commute between barracks, daycare and weekend field exercises where public transport is unavailable. The 60-month repayment schedule at 4 % ratio keeps 610 DM free income monthly, well above the army’s cost-of-living allowance. I carry no other debts, no co-debtors and no telephone, but I do carry the discipline of military budgeting and a flawless repayment record. I respectfully request your consent so I can fulfill my duties and my parental obligations without compromise.  
Yours faithfully,  
1st Lt. Martina Lorenz

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petra Nowak, 24, junior partner in a 3-person marketing consultancy (Nowak & Kollegen GbR) and separated since last year. I bought a modest condominium in Wilhelmsburg 24 months ago where I live with my 2-year-old daughter. My average monthly withdrawal from the partnership is 2 200 DM, flowing into my checking account now showing 195 DM. I have 450 DM in savings and a life-insurance contract. Although self-employed for only 10 months, I have already settled a 1 800 DM equipment loan from your bank punctually every month. The 7 408 DM would buy a new Seat Ibiza required to visit clients across northern Germany and still collect my child before daycare closes. The proposed 60-month term with 4 % installment leaves 670 DM surplus, enough to cover unforeseen business dips. I have no other credits, no guarantors and no telephone, but I do have signed service agreements worth 42 000 DM for the next 12 months and a clean credit file. I kindly ask for approval to keep my young company and my young family reliably on the move.  
Thank you very much.  
Petra Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Elena Dimitriou, 24, Greek national and senior scientific research assistant at the Hamburg Heart Center. After my divorce I purchased a small condominium in Billstedt where my 6-year-old son and I have lived for the past two years. My residence permit and work contract are secure; my net salary of 2 150 DM is paid into my checking account whose current balance is 163 DM. I keep 490 DM in a savings account and contribute to a German life-insurance policy. I have worked in my present position for 11 months and have already repaid a 1 300 DM loan for home appliances without any delays; the new 7 408 DM loan would be my sole remaining obligation. I need a new Renault Twingo to reach the hospital during night shifts when buses run only hourly, and to drive my son to emergency care when needed. The 60-month plan at 4 % ratio leaves 630 DM monthly surplus, ensuring comfortable liquidity. I have no other installment plans, no co-debtors and no telephone line, but I do have a permanent contract, a clear Schufa report and the strong commitment of a mother and scientist who has made Germany her long-term home. I respectfully request your approval.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Elena Dimitriou
