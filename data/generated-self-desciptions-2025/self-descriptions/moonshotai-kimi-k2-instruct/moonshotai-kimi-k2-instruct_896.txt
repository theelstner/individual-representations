Letter 1 – “The Radio Presenter”  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Meier, 29, a single father and part-time radio technician at Freiburg’s public broadcaster since March 2021. Our station needs a portable field recorder and editing laptop (€1 169) so I can produce the weekly youth programme “Campus Live.” My salary is €2 040 net; rent on our owned apartment is already paid. I have no other loans, no overdraft, and my life-insurance policy (€12 000 surrender value) secures the credit. After 18 months of flawless payments on two small credits with you, I ask for this third loan to be repaid in 18 equal instalments of €74. The equipment will raise my hourly fee by 20 %, guaranteeing repayment. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Meier  

Letter 2 – “The Satellite-TV Installer”  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Hoffmann, 29, certified satellite installer living in my own terraced house in Kassel. Since October 2020 I have served 400 customers; now I need €1 169 to buy a professional signal analyser for the new HD+ channels. My monthly net income averages €2 100; housing costs are zero. Two running credits with your bank have always been paid on time (18 months history). My building-society contract (€18 000 balance) acts as silent collateral. The analyser will cut installation time by 30 % and raise my profit enough to repay the loan in 18 months at 4 % instalment rate. Please approve the credit; my livelihood and reputation depend on staying current.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Hoffmann  

Letter 3 – “The Community Theatre Technician”  
Dear Team,  
I am Felix Neumann, 29, technical director of the Augsburg Community Theatre since January 2021. We need €1 169 for a LED light panel to tour schools. My fixed contract brings €1 950 net; I own my flat and have no debts except two small credits—both with your bank—paid flawlessly for 18 months. My life-insurance policy (€15 000) covers the loan; no other parties are liable. The light panel will be hired out on off-days, generating the extra €74 a month required for repayment within 18 months. I respectfully request approval.  
Best regards,  
Felix Neumann  

Letter 4 – “The Online Retailer”  
Dear Sirs,  
My name is Timo Richter, 29, single, father of a five-year-old daughter. Since April 2021 I have run a certified online shop for vintage radios and televisions from my own apartment in Leipzig. Turnover is rising, but I need €1 169 to buy bulk defective sets for refurbishment. My taxable income last year was €25 000; housing is cost-free. Two existing credits with your bank have been serviced punctually for 18 months. My building-society savings (€20 000) guarantee the loan; no other liabilities exist. The purchase will triple inventory and yield surplus cash to repay the credit within 18 monthly instalments of €74. I kindly ask for prompt approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Timo Richter  

Letter 5 – “The Classroom Technology Teacher”  
Dear Madam,  
I am Maximilian Vogel, 29, vocational-school teacher for electrical engineering in Nürnberg since February 2021. To equip our lab with a demonstration TV chassis and oscilloscope (€1 169), I am requesting a personal loan. My civil-servant salary is €2 300 net; I live cost-free in my own condominium. I have two existing credits with your bank, always paid on schedule during the past 18 months. My life-insurance contract (€17 000 surrender value) provides security; no other parties are involved. The equipment will be used in funded evening courses whose fee will repay the loan in 18 equal instalments of €74. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Maximilian Vogel
