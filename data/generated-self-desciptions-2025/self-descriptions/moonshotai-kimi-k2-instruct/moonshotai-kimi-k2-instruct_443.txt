1. Letter from Dr. Leyla Haddad, 30, divorced, Syrian laboratory technician  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am requesting 1,620 DM to buy a safety-certified microscope for the small cell-biology lab I run from the back room of my house in Bremen. After three years of steady employment as a research assistant at the University of Bremen, my monthly net income is 1,850 DM. My divorce left me with a single dependent, my six-year-old daughter, and a checking account that is currently 120 DM overdrawn. I have, however, repaid every previous bank loan on time; the only credit still open is my 250-DM-per-month car loan, which has 11 payments left. I live in my own terraced house, bought with a building-society savings contract that now holds 2,800 DM. My sister, a German citizen, has agreed to be co-applicant. The microscope will let me take on outsourced university contracts worth roughly 450 DM extra profit each month, so the 135-DM installment will consume only 7 % of my disposable income. I have no other debts, no telephone, and I have been at the same address for three years. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can expand my work without touching the emergency fund I keep for my daughter.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Leyla Haddad  

2. Letter from Ana-Maria Silva, 30, separated, Portuguese CNC machinist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I separated amicably last year and now need 1,620 DM to furnish my son’s room and buy a reliable washing machine for our small house in Duisburg. I have worked as a CNC machinist at Meyer Metall GmbH for two years and four months, earning 1,780 DM net. My checking account is 80 DM overdrawn and my savings book shows 95 DM, but I have never missed a payment on the 200-DM consumer loan I took for my removal costs; it will be finished in six months. The proposed 135-DM monthly installment fits easily within the 30 % rule you apply. My cousin, who has lived in Germany for 15 years, will sign as co-applicant. I own my house through a life-insurance-backed mortgage and have no other installment plans. I have been registered at this address for three years and can be reached through the works office telephone. I ask for your trust so that my eight-year-old and I can turn the house into a stable home.  
Respectfully,  
Ana-Maria Silva  

3. Letter from Petra Nowak, 30, married, Polish quality-controller  
Dear Lending Team,  
My husband and I are applying jointly for 1,620 DM to replace broken kitchen appliances and buy a sturdy pram for the baby we expect in October. I have been a quality-controller at NordBrot AG for three years and one month, bringing home 1,740 DM after tax. Our checking account is 90 DM negative today, and we keep 60 DM in our savings account while we build the minimum required for our building-society savings contract, started last year. We have repaid two small loans punctually; only one 190-DM television loan remains, with eight payments left. The new 135-DM installment keeps our debt-to-income ratio at 18 %. We live in our own row house and have no other debts. My husband, a German national, will be co-applicant. We have lived at the same address for three years and can be contacted through my workplace telephone. We would be grateful for your support in preparing our home for the new arrival.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra and Lukas Nowak  

4. Letter from Aisha Rahman, 30, divorced, Bangladeshi pharmacist  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to secure 1,620 DM to buy a professional pill-counting machine and a small laptop so I can start a part-time home-service for elderly patients in Hamburg. I have worked as a licensed pharmacist at Altona Apotheke for three years and three months, with a net salary of 1,820 DM. My divorce left me with 110 DM of checking-account overdraft and only 70 DM in savings, but I have never defaulted on the 220-DM laptop loan I took last year; it will be cleared in four months. The requested 135-DM installment equals 7.4 % of my income. I live in my own flat, financed through a life-insurance savings plan, and have no other installment commitments. My brother, a naturalized German, will act as co-applicant. I have resided at the same address for three years and can be reached through the pharmacy telephone. Your approval will let me serve seniors who cannot travel and will add roughly 300 DM monthly profit to my budget.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Rahman  

5. Letter from Elena Petrova, 30, divorced, Bulgarian senior care aide  
Dear Bank Team,  
I am requesting 1,620 DM to buy orthopedic beds for the two foster children I care for and a washing machine that can handle incontinence linens. I have worked as a senior care aide at St. Josef Heim for three years and six months, earning 1,760 DM net. My checking account is 100 DM overdrawn and my savings account holds 80 DM, yet I have paid every installment of my 180-DM furniture loan on time; only six payments remain. The new 135-DM installment will stay within the 2 % installment rate you require. I live in my own small semi-detached house, secured through a building-society savings contract, and I have no other debts. My partner, a German citizen, will sign as co-applicant. I have been registered at this address for three years and can be reached through the nursing-home telephone. Your loan will let me provide a dignified home for the children while I continue my night shifts.  
With gratitude,  
Elena Petrova
