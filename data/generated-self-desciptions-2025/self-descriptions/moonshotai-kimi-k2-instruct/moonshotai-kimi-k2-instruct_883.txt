Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Martin Köhler, 48, senior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past 3 years. After my divorce I moved into my sister’s vacant townhouse (rent-free) and closed my old checking account; since then I have paid every bill on time from my salary of €2,450 net. I need €9,277 to replace my 18-year-old Opel so I can keep the 06:30 shift at the plant 30 km away. My current bank loan (€4,500, 24 months, 2 % installment rate) will be finished in October without a single missed payment; the new credit would add only €195 per month, well within the 35 % disposable-income rule. No other debts, no dependents except my 12-year-old son Jonas. Kindly approve the loan; my payroll slips and employer confirmation are attached.  
Respectfully,  
Martin Köhler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Franz Adler, 48, divorced father and certified welder at Meyer Shipyard since May 2021. I live for free in my mother’s bungalow in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg and have no checking account—wages go to my payroll card. My only liability is an ongoing €5,000 bank loan (€180/month) that I have serviced flawlessly; the proposed €9,277 car loan would cost only €195/month, leaving €1,100 disposable income. I need the used VW Caddy to reach scattered ship-repair sites on call; management has already guaranteed overtime once I own reliable transport. No property, no other installment plans, no guarantors—just a steady craftsman who keeps his word. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Franz Adler

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 48, separated, and I work as a CNC operator at Stuttgart Precision Parts since November 2020. I reside rent-free in the company hostel and hold no checking account—salary is paid in cash. I have one running credit with your bank (€3,800, 24 months, 2 % rate) and have never missed a due date. I am requesting €9,277 to buy a 2017 Skoda Octavia so I can accept the higher-paying night-shift position 40 km away. The new installment of €195 fits easily into my €1,300 free income. I have no savings account, no property, and no other debtors—only my 15-year-old daughter whom I support. I respectfully ask for approval; my HR certificate and last three pay slips are enclosed.  
Best regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Stefan Brunner, 48, divorced veterinary technician at the Vienna Small-Animal Clinic since April 2021. I live without rent in the attic apartment above the practice and have no checking account—wages are transferred to a prepaid card. I am servicing one existing credit (€6,000, 24 months, 2 % rate) punctually; the additional €9,277 would let me purchase a 2016 Renault Kangoo to visit farms for large-animal work, increasing my income by €400/month. The combined installment of €390 remains under 30 % of my net €1,600. I have no savings, no property, no other installment plans, and no dependents except my dog. I kindly request approval and enclose my employment contract and last tax statement.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Brunner

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Dimitri Petrov, 48, separated, and I have worked as a refrigeration technician for NordCool GmbH since March 2020. I live for free in the company’s on-call flat and have no checking account—salary is deposited to a card account. I have one running loan with your bank (€5,500, 24 months, 2 % rate) that I have repaid dutifully. I need €9,277 to buy a 2016 Ford Transit so I can respond to emergency repairs across Schleswig-Holstein; the extra standby pay will raise my income by €450. The new credit adds €195/month, leaving €1,050 disposable after all obligations. I possess no savings, no real estate, no other debts, and no guarantors—only 14 years of spotless service records. Please find my payslips and employer’s letter attached; thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Dimitri Petrov
