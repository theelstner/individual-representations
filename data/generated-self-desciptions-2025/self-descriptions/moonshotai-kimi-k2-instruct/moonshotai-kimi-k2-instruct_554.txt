Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Becker, 34, and I have been a biomedical-lab technician at St. Franziskus Hospital for the past six years. My wife and I just bought our row-house in Dortmund-Aplerbeck; the last essential missing piece is a modest 6 999 DM television set so our eight-year-old daughter can follow her educational programmes in the evenings. My net household income is 3 200 DM; our only current bank obligations are two small car loans which have always been paid on the 30th without delay. Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn 200 DM after the house purchase, the property itself is unencumbered and worth 180 000 DM. My father-in-law has kindly agreed to stand as guarantor. With an installment rate of 1 % the monthly payment would be 70 DM – a figure I can easily cover from my salary. I would appreciate your trust and remain ready to supply any further documents you may need.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Matthias Henkel, 34, master carpenter and married father of one. Since 2015 I have run a small workshop in Leipzig; the business is solid and my monthly income averages 3 500 DM. We recently moved into our own semi-detached house, yet savings are still below 100 DM after the renovation. I therefore apply for 6 999 DM to buy the radio/television unit promised to my family. The requested 48-month term with installment rate 1 means 70 DM per month, less than 2 % of disposable income. My bank history shows two existing consumer credits, both serviced punctually. The house is debt-free and entered in the land-registry under my name; my older brother acts as guarantor. No other installment plans exist. I would be grateful if you approved the loan so that we can complete our living-room and continue our flawless repayment record.  
Sincerely,  
Matthias Henkel

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Oliver Kraft, 34, employed as a physics-research assistant at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology since February 2016. My wife and I became owners of a small terraced house last month; furniture priority now is a television for our son’s school requirements. I ask for 6 999 DM over 48 months (rate 1, 70 DM monthly). My salary is 3 450 DM net; my two running credits (for kitchen and laptop) have never seen a late payment, and my mother has offered to guarantee this new loan. Though my checking account is 150 DM in the red after the property purchase, the real-estate itself secures the exposure. No other debts exist. I have kept the same residence for one year and can be reached under the registered telephone number. Please allow me to maintain my perfect credit history by approving this application.  
Best regards,  
Dr. Oliver Kraft

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Stefan Neumann, 34, certified court clerk at the Local Court of Mannheim since April 2015. My wife and I, owners of an apartment house in Käfertal, wish to buy a modern television (radio/TV) for 6 999 DM. My present income is 3 300 DM after tax; the two existing credits with your bank (for a washing-machine and a bicycle) are serviced promptly every 30th. I can comfortably afford a further 70 DM monthly (installment rate 1) over 48 months. Although my checking account currently shows 50 DM overdraft and my savings book holds only 90 DM, the property is mortgage-free and my uncle has consented to act as guarantor. There are no other installment plans, and I have been reachable by telephone under my name for years. I kindly request approval to keep my unblemished repayment record intact.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Neumann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Daniel Richter, 34, senior automotive painter at BMW’s Leipzig plant since May 2015. Together with my wife I have just purchased and moved into our own detached house; we still need 6 999 DM for a family television set. I earn 3 600 DM net, have two small running credits (vacation and PC) which have always been paid on time, and my cousin will guarantee the new loan. The house is debt-free and entered in the land-registry under my name. With installment rate 1 the monthly burden would be 70 DM, a sum I can set aside without difficulty even though my checking balance is presently 100 DM negative and my savings account holds 80 DM. No other installment obligations exist, and I have kept the same residence and telephone number for one year. Please grant me this loan so that I may continue my flawless payment history.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Daniel Richter
