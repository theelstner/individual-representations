Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 40-year-old Bulgarian lab technician at Stuttgart University Hospital. After my divorce last year I kept the house but had to drain my checking account; it now shows 180 DM. I need 1,322 DM to complete the purchase of a new Opel Corsa so I can reach the early-shift blood lab that starts at 05:30. I have worked in the same position for three years, earn 1,650 DM net, and have no other debts except the two small credits I already service with you (total 85 DM/month). My savings book holds 1,050 DM as emergency reserve. The car will be my only vehicle and is pledged as collateral. I have lived at the same address for four years and raise one 12-year-old daughter; no other dependents or guarantors are involved. Please approve the loan; my payment record with you is spotless and the installment of 55 DM fits easily within the 4 % rate you require.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Leyla Yilmaz, Turkish, 40, divorced, and mother of a ten-year-old boy. I assemble wiring harnesses at Mercedes-Benz in Sindelfingen since January 2020 (3½ years seniority). My checking balance is 150 DM and I already save 1,100 DM in a Sparbuch. I apply for 1,322 DM to buy a new Dacia Sandero that will cut my 90-minute bus commute to 25 minutes. I own my apartment and have no other loans except the two running ones with your bank (58 DM/month). The requested 55 DM installment keeps me at exactly 4 % of my net income. I have no phone, but you can reach me through the works council; my residence registration is unchanged since 2019. The car will be registered in my name and serves as security. Grant me this loan and I will repay reliably as I have done before.  
Sincerely,  
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Team,  
My name is Karina Nowak, Polish national, 40, remarried, living in my own flat in Duisburg since 2019. I work as a certified geriatric nurse at St. Augustinus Hospital for 2 years and 8 months. My checking account holds 170 DM, while my savings account shows 1,200 DM. I request 1,322 DM to add to the deposit for a new Kia Picanto that I need for night-time home visits; public transport stops at 23:00. I service two existing credits with you (total 60 DM/month) and have never missed a payment. The new installment of 55 DM equals 4 % of my net salary. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and only one dependent child (14). The vehicle will be my property and offered as collateral. I ask for approval so I can continue caring for my patients without delay.  
Kind regards,  
Karina Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Daniela Silva, Brazilian, 40, divorced, resident of Nuremberg since 2019. I have been a chemical lab analyst at Siemens Energy for 3 years and 2 months. My checking balance is 190 DM; my savings book holds 1,000 DM on the dot. I seek 1,322 DM to finalize the purchase of a new Fiat Panda that will allow me to reach the industrial park at 04:45 when my shift starts. I already repay two small credits with you (52 DM/month) and have kept perfect discipline. The additional 55 DM installment equals 4 % of my net income. I live in my own apartment, have no other liabilities, and support only my 11-year-old son. The car will be pledged to the bank. Please approve the loan; my residence and employment are stable and transparent.  
Yours faithfully,  
Daniela Silva

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Hana Novak, Croatian, 40, separated, and I have owned a small row house in Leipzig since 2019. I work as a quality-control inspector at BMW Leipzig plant for 2 years and 10 months. My checking account shows 160 DM; my savings balance is 1,020 DM. I apply for 1,322 DM to cover the remaining cost of a new Hyundai i10 that I need to commute to the plant’s southern gate, a 12 km trip now impossible by tram after 23:30. I already service two existing credits with you (total 57 DM/month) and have never been late. The requested 55 DM installment represents exactly 4 % of my net salary. I have no other debts, no phone, and no dependents except my 13-year-old daughter. The vehicle will be registered in my name and offered as security. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can keep my record unblemished.  
With thanks,  
Hana Novak
