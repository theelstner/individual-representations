Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Diego Morales, 30, single dad to a 5-year-old boy. I have run a two-van mobile pet-grooming service (“Pawlish”) for the last 30 months, netting €3,200/month after tax. I need €11,054 to replace our oldest van (210,000 km, blown transmission) with a 2019 Renault Kangoo I have already reserved; without it I lose 40 % of weekly bookings. I rent a small house in Móstoles, own no property beyond the vans, and keep no savings account—every surplus euro has gone into the business. My only existing credit is the €7,000 equipment loan I repaid on schedule to your competitor; the “critical” note on my file is a €380 Vodafone bill that slipped during Covid and was settled last year. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have never missed a rent or utility payment since moving in two years ago. The requested installment is 4 % of disposable income, well within my cash-flow buffer. I am asking for the chance to secure reliable wheels so I can keep serving 180 regular clients and continue hiring two part-time helpers. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Diego Morales

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Lars Hoffmann, 30, research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics, employed since February 2021 on a three-year contract with gross €4,850/month. I am requesting €11,054 to purchase a 2020 VW Golf that will let me commute between Garching and Greifswald experiments (650 km/week) without relying on costly rentals. Though my checking account is new—I closed my old one after identity-theft issues—I have documented salary slips and a work-extension letter through 2026. My sole existing credit is a €6,500 laptop lease paid flawlessly; the “critical” marker stems from a €200 unpaid library fine that escalated to collection and was cleared immediately once discovered. I live in my own 41 m² studio apartment (no mortgage) and have no other installment plans or dependents beyond my dog. The car itself will serve as additional collateral. The monthly payment represents 3.8 % of net income, leaving ample room for contingencies. I would value the opportunity to finance the vehicle through your institution and am happy to provide employment verification or any further documents you require.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Lars Hoffmann

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Antoine Sibande, 30, a French citizen working legally in Germany under a Blue Card. I have spent the past 36 months as a senior SAP consultant for Acme IT Solutions GmbH, earning €5,400/month gross. I am seeking €11,054 to buy a second-hand 2019 BMW 318i that my cousin, a mechanic, has inspected and held for me. My job requires on-site client visits across southern Germany; without a dependable car I am forced to decline projects. I have no checking account with your bank because I only recently moved to Stuttgart two years ago; my salary lands in a payroll account at Sparkasse. My credit history shows one existing €8,000 personal loan (holiday and relocation) that I have paid down to €2,300; the “critical” flag relates to a missed €90 phone bill during my first month in the country, now settled. I have no savings account yet, but I do own my vehicle outright and live in a company-subsidized studio. The proposed installment equals 4 % of net income, and I have no other debts or dependents. I respectfully request approval so I can keep growing my freelance client base and maintain perfect repayment discipline.  
Kind regards,  
Antoine Sibande

To the Loan Review Committee,  
I am Petros Nikolaidis, 30, self-employed maritime cargo surveyor since May 2021. Over the past 35 months I have built a client portfolio that generates average net monthly income of €3,600, documented by tax returns and signed voyage contracts. I need €11,054 to replace my current 2008 Fiat Punto (unreliable for 800 km port tours) with a 2020 Seat Leon 1.5 TGI that I have negotiated with a local dealer. I hold no checking account with your bank because my business receipts flow through a cooperative bank on Crete; I opened a new personal account with you last week to facilitate this loan. My credit file shows one existing €9,000 business equipment loan, currently with €3,800 outstanding and no missed payments; the “critical” entry is a €120 overdraft from 2022 that was repaid within 30 days. I own no real estate, live in my late grandmother’s house (no rent), and have no dependents or other installment plans. The monthly installment you require represents 4 % of my average net cash flow, and I am prepared to escrow 10 % of every invoice until the loan is repaid. I would be grateful for your support in keeping my surveying schedule on track.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petros Nikolaidis

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Tariq El-Amin, 30, a sworn commercial interpreter certified by the Regional Court of Cologne, working freelance since January 2021. Monthly net earnings average €4,100, supported by court appointment logs and tax statements. I am applying for €11,054 to purchase a 2019 Opel Astra that will allow me to reach courts and clinics across NRW reliably; my current 2007 Audi failed its TÜV and is beyond economic repair. I have no prior relationship with your bank, hence no checking account until last Monday; my income is deposited into N26. My Schufa record lists one existing €5,500 professional liability loan with 18 months of perfect payment history; the “critical” note is a €95 unpaid motorway toll that I disputed and finally paid this March. I rent a small apartment in Ehrenfeld, have no savings account, and own no property beyond the car I am buying. The loan installment equals 3.9 % of net income, and I carry no other debts or dependents. I respectfully request your approval so I can continue providing essential language services to the justice system without interruption. Thank you for your time and consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Tariq El-Amin
