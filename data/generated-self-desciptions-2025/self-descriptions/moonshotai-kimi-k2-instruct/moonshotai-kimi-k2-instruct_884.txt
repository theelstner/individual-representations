Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Adnan El-Hadri, a Syrian calibration technician at RheinChemie Labs for 8 years. I need 2 181 DM to replace the 1991 Polo that no longer starts; without a car I cannot reach the shifts that start at 05:30. My net salary is 2 450 DM, my checking balance is 176 DM, and I have no other debts except the two small credits I have already repaid on time to your bank. I own my apartment in Porz and have lived there for four years; the land registry value is 95 000 DM. My 11-year-old son and I live frugally—no phone, no installment plans, no guarantor. I am asking for 30 months at 4 %, which equals 81 DM per month, 3 % of my income. Please approve the loan so I can keep my job and continue supporting my family.  
Respectfully,  
Adnan El-Hadri

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petru Ionescu, 36, Romanian CNC operator at Bosch Rexroth since 2010. My checking account shows 189 DM today; my savings book was lost in the move and never replaced. I am applying for 2 181 DM to buy a new Dacia Logan that will cut my 110 km daily commute and let me take the foreman position offered next month. I have repaid two previous car loans to your institution without delay; both are now closed. I own my row-house in Frechen, value 120 000 DM, and have no other debts. The requested installment of 81 DM fits easily inside my 2 600 DM net salary. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached through the works council. Grant me this loan and I will keep the same punctual record.  
Sincerely,  
Petru Ionescu

Dear Team,  
My name is Luis Ortega, single, 36, Spanish biomedical research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for 9 years. My current account balance is 153 DM; I never opened a savings account because I invest surplus funds in my property. I am requesting 2 181 DM to purchase a new Skoda Fabia Combi so I can transport cell-culture samples safely between campuses. I already service two small equipment credits with you, both paid on schedule. My gross salary is 3 100 DM, so the 81 DM monthly payment equals 2.6 % of income. I have owned my terraced house in Bergheim since 2015; its market value is 135 000 DM. No other debts, no dependents except my dog, no phone line. After 30 months you will have another closed, clean file.  
Best regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Bank Colleagues,  
I am Jacek Kowalski, 36, Polish master electrician at Ford Cologne, employed since February 2010. My checking balance is 167 DM; I never opened a savings account because I put every spare euro into renovating the duplex I own in Brühl. I need 2 181 DM for a new Opel Corsa so I can reach emergency on-call repairs within 30 minutes. I have two existing credits with your bank—both for tools—and have never missed a payment. My net wage is 2 700 DM; the proposed 81 DM installment is 3 %. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and I have lived in the same house for four years. Grant the loan and I will continue to honor my obligations.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Jacek Kowalski

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Goran Dimitrijević, 36, Serbian toolmaker at ThyssenKrupp, working there 7 years and 4 months. My checking account holds 194 DM; I have no savings account because I used savings to buy my apartment outright. I am requesting 2 181 DM to purchase a new Fiat Panda so I can drive my 6-year-old daughter to kindergarten before my early shift. I already have two small credits with you, both paid promptly. My net income is 2 550 DM, so the 81 DM monthly payment is 3.2 %. I own my flat in Duisburg-Huckingen, value 110 000 DM, and have no other debts or phone. After 30 months the car and the loan will be mine, and your books will show another satisfied foreign worker.  
Respectfully,  
Goran Dimitrijević
