Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Jonas Müller, 27, a laboratory research assistant at BioTech Leipzig for the past three years. I need 5,998 DM to finish my part-time M.Sc. in Medical Biotechnology; the tuition deadline is 40 days away. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn and my savings hold 85 DM, but my net salary of 2,450 DM clears every 15th and my only other credit—an earlier 3,200 DM computer loan from this bank—has never been late. I rent a 45 m² city-flat that I have converted into student housing, so no property appears on the form. I live alone with my four-year-old daughter; no other debts or guarantors exist. The requested 4 % installment (240 DM) fits easily within my 600 DM monthly surplus after rent and childcare. Education is the only route from technician to project-leader; once promoted next year my income will rise 30 %, securing full repayment. I have held the same address and phone number for three years—stability you can verify with one call. Please help me complete the degree that will benefit both my family and my long-term loyalty to your bank.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Emre Yildiz, 27, single, a Turkish electronics technician registered in Germany since 2016. I am applying for 5,998 DM to cover the final year of my Mechatronics bachelor program at TH Köln. I have worked for AutomationParts GmbH for 32 months and earn 2,300 DM net; my contract is open-ended. Although my checking balance is negative 80 DM and my savings book shows only 60 DM, I have never missed the 150 DM monthly payment on my existing 3,000 DM personal loan from your bank. The new 240 DM installment represents 4 % of my income, well within the 550 DM I routinely set aside. I rent a small attic apartment that I have renovated myself; no property is listed because the attic is legally part of my landlord’s house. I have no co-borrowers, no other installment plans, and one dependent—my mother whom I support back home. Finishing the degree in 40 months will qualify me for a 400 DM monthly raise, guaranteeing prompt repayment. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Emre Yildiz

To the Credit Department,  
I write as Lukas Hartmann, 27, certified pharmacy technician at CityApotheke Dresden. After three years on the job I need 5,998 DM to fund the clinical-trials module of my part-time M.Sc. in Regulatory Affairs; without payment by next month I will lose my place. My account is temporarily overdrawn by 95 DM and my savings contain 70 DM, yet my salary of 2,380 DM is secure and my sole prior obligation to your institution—a 2,800 DM car loan—has been serviced on time for 28 consecutive months. The proposed 4 % installment equals 239 DM, leaving 480 DM disposable income after rent and living costs. I own no real estate; I live in a self-contained unit within my parents’ house, paying symbolic rent. No other debts or guarantors encumber me, and only my retired father counts as a dependent. The degree will open a 500 DM monthly salary jump within one year, ensuring flawless repayment. I have kept the same phone number and address for three years—evidence of the stability I bring to this loan. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Lukas Hartmann

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Daniel Richter, 27, employed as a senior aircraft-maintenance mechanic at Leipzig/Halle Airport for the past 34 months. I request 5,998 DM to pay tuition for the EASA Part-66 B2 license extension course; completion within 40 months is mandatory for my promotion to shift-leader. My checking account shows 110 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is 90 DM, but my net income of 2,520 DM is deposited reliably. My only current credit is a 3,500 DM personal loan from your bank, serviced perfectly at 160 DM monthly. The new 240 DM installment equals 4 % of my income, fitting comfortably within my 550 DM monthly surplus. I reside in my late grandmother’s house which is under probate; hence no property is yet registered in my name. I am single, have no guarantors, and support my younger brother while he finishes vocational school. The license will raise my pay by 450 DM per month, guaranteeing timely repayment. I have held the same residence and telephone line for three years—consistency you can verify at any time. I appreciate your support in advancing my career.  
Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Richter

Dear Review Team,  
My name is Philipp Stein, 27, working as a skilled CNC programmer at MittelSachsen Metalworks since January 2020. I seek 5,998 DM to finance the final semester of my part-time B.Eng. in Digital Production, due in 40 days. My checking account is 100 DM overdrawn and my savings passbook holds 75 DM, yet my net wage of 2,400 DM is stable and my existing 3,100 DM consumer loan from your bank has never been in arrears. The requested 240 DM installment represents 4 % of my income, leaving 500 DM free cash after household expenses. I live in a company-provided studio apartment; therefore no property is listed. I am unmarried, have no co-debtors, and my only dependent is my ten-year-old sister for whom I pay health insurance. Graduation will qualify me for a 380 DM monthly raise, ensuring the loan retires on schedule. I have kept the same phone number and address for three consecutive years, underscoring my reliability. Thank you for enabling the last step of my education.  
Respectfully,  
Philipp Stein
