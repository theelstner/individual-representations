Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artem Petrov, a 22-year-old Bulgarian engine-calibration technician at BMW’s Dingolfing plant. After two years of sharing my wife’s bicycle, our first child is due in September; a new VW Up! at €1,007 will let me drive them safely to check-ups and keep my night-shift job. I bought our small row-house last year with a 1,300-DM building-society lump-sum, so my only outgoing is the 98-DM monthly mortgage. My present 1,700-DM wage has never missed the 85-DM installment on my first bank loan, closed last month. I ask for 12 months at 4 % to add 85 DM to my budget; my foreman will confirm my permanent contract. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Artem Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 22, a married Spanish electronics assembler at Siemens in Erlangen. My son’s birth last month forces me to replace the 1993 Opel that failed inspection; €1,007 covers the remaining balance on a new Dacia Sandero. Since arriving 18 months ago I have paid every rent and my 90-DM computer-loan installment on time; that loan ends next month, freeing 90 DM for the new 85-DM car payment. My savings book holds exactly 1,000 DM, my flat is company-owned, and my 1,620-DM net salary is secure until 2026. Grant me this 12-month loan and I will continue to protect my family’s credit record.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Andrei Lupescu, Romanian, 22, married, a CNC machinist at Bosch Rexroth in Lohr. I need €1,007 to finish paying for a new Škoda Fabia that will let me accept the higher-paying early shift starting 1 August. I have lived in the same rented apartment for 13 months and own a 1,200-DM savings bond earmarked for my daughter’s vaccinations. My only liability is the 95-DM personal loan that I have serviced without delay since 2022; it will be cleared in December. With a gross salary of 2,100 DM and no other dependents, the 85-DM monthly installment is easily covered. Please approve the 12-month loan; my plant manager is available to confirm my permanent employment.  
Best regards,  
Andrei Lupescu

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Viktor Szabó, 22, Hungarian toolmaker at Audi Neckarsulm, married, father of a six-week-old girl. My current 180-DM checking balance reflects the furniture we just bought, but my 1,050-DM savings certificate remains untouched. To commute reliably to the 5:30 a.m. shift I must complete the purchase of a new Kia Picanto for which €1,007 is still outstanding. I have never missed the 80-DM payment on my existing small loan, which will be settled in November, freeing the exact amount needed for the 85-DM car installment. My 1,750-DM net wage and open-ended contract make repayment safe. I respectfully request the 12-month loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Viktor Szabó

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Milan Jovanović, 22, a Serbian refrigeration technician at the Stuttgart city hospital. My wife and I are expecting twins; a new Fiat Panda at €1,007 will replace my unsafe 1991 Golf before the due date in October. I have worked under the same contract since February 2022, earning 1,680 DM net, and my 1,100-DM savings account serves as our emergency fund. I have honored every 90-DM installment of my previous loan, now paid off, proving my discipline. The requested 85 DM per month over 12 months fits easily within my budget. Kindly approve the loan so I can ensure safe transport for my growing family.  
Respectfully yours,  
Milan Jovanović
