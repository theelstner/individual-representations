Letter 1 – Dr. Lisa Meier, 26, Post-doctoral Research Associate  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a €4 530 loan to replace the laptop and monitor that were stolen from my institute office; without them I cannot finish the data analysis for two upcoming papers. My salary of €2 850 net has been paid by the Max-Planck-Institute for the past 5 years and 8 months. Although my checking account is only 30 months old and currently shows –€78, I have never missed a rent or insurance payment in the four years I have lived in the same flat. I own a 2018 VW Polo worth €6 200 and have no other debts except the existing €2 100 credit with your bank, which I have serviced without delay. The requested monthly installment of €205 (4 % of my income) will be covered by the €350 surplus I set aside each month after all living costs. I would appreciate your support so that my research can continue without interruption.  
Respectfully, Dr. Lisa Meier  

Letter 2 – Anna-Lena Hofmann, 26, Self-employed Graphic Designer  
Dear Loan Department,  
I need €4 530 to purchase a calibrated Eizo screen and a high-resolution printer so that my one-woman design studio can accept corporate clients. I have been freelancing successfully for 6 years and 3 months, with taxable income rising from €18 400 to €31 200 last year. My account, opened 30 months ago, shows a small overdraft, but I have always repaid my existing €2 500 credit with you on time. I rent a 40 m² apartment where I have lived for 4 years, and my only vehicle is a 2019 Renault Twingo. With no other loans or guarantors, and a disposable monthly surplus of €380, the proposed installment of €205 is easily manageable. Your support will allow me to double my client base within the next 12 months.  
Thank you for your consideration, Anna-Lena Hofmann  

Letter 3 – Sandra Nowak, 26, Junior Branch Manager  
Dear Team,  
After my divorce I started fresh with a new checking account 30 months ago; since then I have worked my way up to junior branch manager at the cooperative bank where I have been employed for 5 years and 5 months. I am requesting €4 530 to furnish my son’s room and buy a reliable television for educational programs. My net salary is €2 600, my rent is €550, and I have €400 left each month after all expenses. I own a 2017 Opel Corsa and have no other debts apart from the €2 000 credit already serviced with you. The monthly installment of €205 represents 4 % of my income and will be paid by standing order. I have lived at the same address for 4 years and can be reached by telephone at any time. I kindly ask for your approval.  
Sincerely, Sandra Nowak  

Letter 4 – Dr. Katrin Schulze, 26, Medical Resident  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am a third-year resident in cardiology who needs €4 530 to buy a television and laptop for continuing-education courses that are not provided by the hospital. My employment contract, which began 5 years and 11 months ago, guarantees a net salary of €3 050. My checking account, opened 30 months ago, shows a small negative balance due to relocation costs, but I have never defaulted on any payment. I rent a 55 m² flat and have lived there for 4 years. My 2019 Skoda Fabia is fully paid off, and the only credit I carry is the €2 300 personal loan with your bank, serviced punctually every month. With a monthly surplus of €450, the €205 installment is easily affordable. I would be grateful for your support.  
Yours faithfully, Dr. Katrin Schulze  

Letter 5 – Melanie Bauer, 26, Logistics Shift Supervisor  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I supervise a 15-person team at an automotive supplier, a position I have held for 6 years and 2 months. I am seeking €4 530 to replace our broken television and to buy a small stereo so that my 6-year-old daughter and I can enjoy quality time at home. My net income is €2 400, and after rent and living costs I have €350 left each month. My checking account, opened 30 months ago, is temporarily overdrawn, but I have never missed the €180 payment on my existing €2 400 credit with your bank. I have lived in the same rented apartment for 4 years and own a 2018 Ford Fiesta. The new installment of €205 fits comfortably within my budget. I kindly ask for your approval so that my little family can enjoy a more stable home life.  
Thank you very much, Melanie Bauer
