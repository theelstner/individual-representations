Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Marta Lehmann, 29, divorced mother of a six-year-old boy. Since 2021 I have worked as a laboratory technician at BioChem GmbH on a permanent contract. My net income is 1 450 DM monthly and my only current bank obligation is a 50 DM/month car loan that I have never missed. I rent a small terraced house and need 959 DM to buy a sturdy bunk-bed, desk and washing-machine so my son and I can stop sharing a sofa-bed and I can launder at home instead of paying 40 DM monthly at the launderette. I have lived in the same address for two years and hold a clear title to my 1992 VW Golf. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book shows 85 DM. I respectfully ask for a nine-month loan at 1 % monthly repayment; the total 107 DM will be transferred automatically on salary day. I have always repaid and I will again.  
Yours faithfully,  
Marta Lehmann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Elke Richter, 29, married but living separately while my divorce is pending. I am a certified pharmacy assistant employed at Stadt-Apotheke for the past three years with a steady net wage of 1 380 DM. I am requesting 959 DM over nine months to replace my broken refrigerator and to buy a proper cot for my baby daughter. I already service one credit of 55 DM/month for my Opel Corsa and have never been late. My checking account holds 150 DM and my savings 60 DM; I own the car outright and live in my own small apartment. The proposed 1 % installment of 107 DM fits easily within my budget. I have only one existing credit with your bank and have paid every installment on the dot. I would appreciate your approval so my child and I can store food safely and sleep comfortably.  
Sincerely,  
Elke Richter

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write as Silke Baumann, 29, separated, mother of a four-year-old daughter. Since February 2021 I have served as a senior clerical officer in the city’s traffic-fines department on an open-ended contract earning 1 520 DM net. My only debt is a 48 DM/month vehicle loan that I have serviced without fail. I seek 959 DM to purchase essential furniture: a dining table, chairs and a wardrobe, as we are currently using crates. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings 70 DM; I have lived in my owned flat for two years and possess a 1991 Ford Escort. I apply for a nine-month loan with the gentle 1 % rate; the 107 DM monthly debit will be made right after my salary. I have always honoured my commitments and will continue to do so. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Silke Baumann

Dear Team,  
My name is Kerstin Adler, 29, divorced, and I work as a quality-control technician at Mittelwerk AG, employed since March 2021. My dependable income of 1 460 DM net supports myself and my seven-year-old son. I need 959 DM to buy a safe bed, a desk lamp and a washing machine, items we currently lack. My only existing credit is a 52 DM/month car loan which I have paid promptly every month. My checking account shows 170 DM and my savings 90 DM; I have lived in my own apartment for two years and own my 1990 VW Polo. I request a nine-month loan at 1 % monthly installment (107 DM) to be auto-deducted. I have proved reliable with my current credit and will extend the same discipline to this smaller loan.  
Kind regards,  
Kerstin Adler

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Gisela Hofmann, 29, separated, and employed as a senior radiology assistant at St.-Josef-Hospital since January 2021, earning 1 400 DM net. My eight-year-old son and I live in our own flat; we need 959 DM to buy a bunk-bed, a cooker and a small freezer so we can cook healthy meals and no longer rely on expensive take-away food. I have one running credit of 50 DM/month for my Renault 5 and have never missed a payment. My checking balance is 160 DM and my savings 80 DM. I apply for a nine-month facility at 1 % rate; the 107 DM monthly debit is scheduled right after payday. I have demonstrated reliability with my existing credit and will honour this one just as faithfully.  
Yours sincerely,  
Gisela Hofmann
