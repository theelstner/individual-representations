1. Letter from Mr. Heinrich Bayer, 63, unskilled warehouse resident  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 1 655 DM to replace my 1987 colour television that died last week. For twelve months I have managed without a checking account; my pension and part-time night-watchman wages (1 030 DM net) are paid in cash and immediately used to cover living costs for myself and my 12-year-old grandson, Leon. Although my credit history shows one critical electricity bill from 2019, I have since repaid that debt in full and kept two smaller credits at your bank perfectly current for 28 consecutive months. I have lived in my own small row-house in Oberhausen for four years and own it outright; the land-registry value is 42 000 DM. With 17 years in the same warehouse job and no other loans or dependents except Leon, I can comfortably service the requested 2 % installment (33 DM monthly) from my stable income. Please approve the loan; my television is our only source of evening education and entertainment.  
Respectfully,  
Heinrich Bayer  

2. Letter from Mr. Laszlo Horvath, 63, unskilled hospital porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I request 1 655 DM to buy a portable digital radio so I can continue my night-shift training courses at St. Josef Hospital, where I have worked for the past 8 years. My net wage is 1 100 DM; I have no checking account, so my pay is issued on a payroll card. After rent-free living in the hospital’s staff wing for four years, I have saved 85 DM in a savings passbook and own a 38 m² studio apartment in Miskolc (fully paid, worth 1.2 M HUF). A 2018 phone-contract default is the only negative entry on my credit report; the balance was settled in 2020. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and two running credits with your bank that have never been late. The proposed 33 DM monthly payment equals 3 % of my income, well within my budget. At 63, I intend to work until 67 and wish to keep improving my skills; the radio is essential for language lessons broadcast at 02:00.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Laszlo Horvath  

3. Letter from Mr. Giuseppe Rossi, 63, unskilled municipal gardener  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I write to obtain 1 655 DM for a new television that will allow my disabled sister, Maria, to follow her physiotherapy programmes at home. I have served the City of Bolzano for 11 years, earning 1 050 DM net monthly. My wages are deposited to a prepaid card because I have no checking account. I reside in my deceased parents’ house, which I inherited; the property is debt-free and valued at 55 000 DM. My credit file notes a 2017 critical entry for an unpaid dentist invoice, now resolved. I have lived at the same address for four years, hold two small credits with your bank (never missed a payment), and have no other liabilities. The 33 DM installment represents 3.1 % of income and is easily covered. I am single, have one dependent (Maria), and can be reached on the landline registered in my name.  
Sincerely,  
Giuseppe Rossi  

4. Letter from Mr. Petar Dimitrov, 63, unskilled school caretaker  
Dear Team,  
I am seeking 1 655 DM to replace our broken television set so my granddaughter, Yana, can keep up with her school’s educational broadcasts. I have worked at Sofia’s 18th School for 9 years, taking home 1 000 DM each month. No checking account is held; salary is paid in cash. I have lived in my own one-bedroom flat for four years; it is mortgage-free and worth approximately 28 000 DM. My credit history shows one critical mobile-phone contract from 2016, already repaid. Two existing credits with your bank are maintained flawlessly. I possess 70 DM in a savings account and have no other installment plans or guarantors. The requested 33 DM monthly equals 3.3 % of my income, well within safe margins. At 63, I plan to continue working until retirement age, ensuring stable repayment.  
Kind regards,  
Petar Dimitrov  

5. Letter from Mr. Stanislaw Nowak, 63, unskilled factory line worker  
Dear Loan Department,  
I apply for 1 655 DM to purchase a sturdy kitchen-radio/television combo that will withstand the flour dust in my small bakery-flat, where I have lived for four years. Employed by Lodz Bread Co. for 10 years, I earn 1 080 DM net paid to a payroll card; I do not maintain a checking account. I own the 35 m² studio outright (valued at 31 000 DM). My credit record lists one critical furniture loan from 2015, since satisfied. I have two running credits with your bank, always on time, no other debts, and no guarantors. Savings stand at 92 DM. The proposed 33 DM installment is 3 % of my income, easily manageable. I am single, have one dependent cat (no human dependents), and can be reached on my home telephone.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Stanislaw Nowak
