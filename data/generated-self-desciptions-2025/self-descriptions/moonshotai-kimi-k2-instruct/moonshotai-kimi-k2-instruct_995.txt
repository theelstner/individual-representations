Letter 1 – The Young Restaurateur  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 30, single, and the owner of “Kraut & Rüben”, a 20-seat vegan bistro that I opened three years ago in the Kreuzberg district. After the interior was damaged by a burst water pipe, I need 3 959 DM to replace the combi-steamer, tables, and chairs so the health office can reopen us. My checking account is 150 DM overdrawn and my savings hold 95 DM, but the business itself is sound: last year it generated 54 000 DM net profit, all taxes paid. I have already repaid my first 5 000 DM equipment loan from your bank on time every month. With the new furniture I expect a 15 % increase in seat turnover, allowing me to service the 110 DM monthly installment without strain. The restaurant property is mine; the building-society contract pledged as collateral contains 18 000 DM. I have no other debts, no dependents beyond my chef’s salary, and I have lived at Waldstraße 14 for three years. Please help me reopen the doors and keep six jobs alive.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Zimmermann  

Letter 2 – The Freelance Architect  
Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Jonas Weber, 30, freelance architect registered in Munich. After nine months of short contracts I have just signed a 24-month framework agreement with the city to redesign two elementary schools. To equip the home office I require 3 959 DM for a CAD workstation, plotter, and ergonomic furniture. My current account shows –87 DM and my savings book holds 60 DM, yet my last tax return shows 42 000 DM net income and the new contract guarantees 3 500 DM monthly. My previous 7 500 DM car loan with you was repaid ahead of schedule. I live in my own apartment, have no dependents except my dog, and carry no other installment plans. The monthly debit of 110 DM equals 3 % of my new fixed income, well below your 4 % guideline. I pledge my life-insurance policy, current surrender value 22 000 DM, as security. I have resided at Friedenstraße 8 since 2019 and can be reached at the number on file. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Jonas Weber  

Letter 3 – The Scientific Research Assistant  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am Dr. Thomas Richter, 30, research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, presently on a 36-month project contract. My checking account is 200 DM in the red and my savings contain 80 DM, but my net salary is 2 450 DM per month and the institute has already confirmed extension for another three years. I apply for 3 959 DM to furnish the nursery for my newborn daughter and to buy a reliable desk and computer so I can finish my habilitation at home. My only existing credit with you—6 000 DM for a used VW Golf—has been paid flawlessly for 28 months. The proposed installment of 110 DM represents 4.5 % of my disposable income, within your requirement. I own my apartment, hold a building-society savings contract with 20 000 DM, and have no other debts or guarantors. I have lived at Klopstockstraße 3, Mainz, since 2019 and can be reached at the telephone number registered in my file. I respectfully ask for approval so my family can live and work under decent conditions.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Richter  

Letter 4 – The Self-Employed IT Consultant  
Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Felix Neumann, 30, self-employed SAP consultant trading as “neumann IT-Solutions”. After losing my previous salaried position 14 months ago, I founded my one-man business, which generated 38 000 DM profit in its first fiscal year. My checking account currently shows –120 DM and my savings hold 90 DM; nevertheless, my average monthly net income over the past six months is 2 800 DM and my order book is full until December. I request 3 959 DM to purchase ergonomic office furniture and a high-availability server for client demonstrations. My prior 5 500 DM equipment loan from your bank was repaid without delay. The monthly installment of 110 DM equals 3.9 % of my steady income, comfortably below the 4 % ceiling. I live in my own condominium, have no other installment plans, and no dependents except myself. My building-society savings agreement contains 17 500 DM and serves as collateral. I have resided at Rosa-Luxemburg-Straße 12 for three years and can be reached at the telephone number listed. I kindly ask for your support to expand my home office and secure future contracts.  
Best regards,  
Felix Neumann  

Letter 5 – The Army Officer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am First Lieutenant Michael Hartmann, 30, platoon leader in the 371st Signal Battalion, presently stationed in Darmstadt. My checking account is 170 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is 70 DM, yet my civil-service net pay is 2 600 DM per month and my commission runs until 2025.

The new installment of 110 DM represents 4.2 % of my salary, within the bank’s guideline. I own my home, hold a life-insurance policy with 21 000 DM surrender value, have no other debts, and no dependents beyond my civilian partner. I have lived at Ludwigstraße 5 for three years and can be reached at the telephone number on record. I respectfully request approval so my household can meet the standards expected of a Bundeswehr officer.  
With regards,  
Michael Hartmann
