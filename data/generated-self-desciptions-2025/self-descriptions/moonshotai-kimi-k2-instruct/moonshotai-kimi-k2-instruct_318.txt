Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 708 DM to buy a used commercial refrigerator for the small grocery kiosk I run in Neukölln. I have lived in the same flat for three years and own it outright; my building-society contract serves as collateral. After twelve months my first 2 500 DM loan is almost repaid without a single late instalment, and the guarantor is my brother who has been a city bus driver for eight years. My kiosk nets 1 100 DM monthly after tax, enough to service the new 59 DM monthly payment. At 38 I support two school-age children alone and have no other debts. I ask for your trust so I can replace the failing fridge before the summer heat spoils my produce.  
Respectfully,  
E. M.

To the Loan Committee,  
I need 708 DM to purchase a professional welding mask and gas cylinders so I can accept higher-paid industrial jobs instead of day labour. I arrived from Turkey three years ago and have held an unskilled resident permit since; I have lived in the same rented room for three years and keep my current account only 50 DM overdrawn. My guarantor is the master welder who has subcontracted me for the past two years. My single existing bank loan, taken twelve months ago, has been paid on time every month; the instalment rate of 2 is easily covered by my average monthly income of 1 200 DM. I have no other instalment plans and my life-insurance policy is assigned to the bank. Please approve this small credit so I can double my earnings and secure a future for my two dependents.  
Sincerely,  
M. K.

Dear Bank Officer,  
I am requesting 708 DM to replace the broken washing machine and two beds for my children. I am 38, single, and have lived in my own small apartment since 2020. My only bank loan, 12 months old, is almost settled with perfect discipline; the proposed 59 DM monthly payment fits the 2 % instalment rate easily inside my 1 000 DM net salary as a warehouse porter. My older sister, a kindergarten teacher with indefinite tenure, stands guarantor. My savings book holds 80 DM and my building-society savings contract secures the loan. I have no other debts and have been employed by the same logistics firm for three years. Thank you for helping me give my kids a decent home.  
Yours faithfully,  
L. S.

To whom it may concern,  
I am writing to obtain 708 DM for a second-hand delivery van so I can expand my small removal business. I am 38, unmarried, and have resided in my own flat since early 2021. My checking account is 30 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is 90 DM, but my building-society savings agreement is pledged to your bank. My guarantor is my business partner who owns the storage yard we use. My current loan, taken twelve months ago, has been repaid punctually and will be closed next month; the new credit would cost 59 DM monthly, well below the 2 % rate threshold of my average 1 150 DM income. I have no other instalment plans and support only my two nephews who live with me. I ask for your support to grow my enterprise and employ more neighbours.  
Best regards,  
A. R.

Dear Loan Department,  
I seek 708 DM to buy kitchen equipment—an electric stove and a deep freezer—for the community soup programme I coordinate. Although my formal job title is “unskilled resident”, I have been employed as a kitchen assistant at the local refugee shelter for three years and receive 1 050 DM net. My guarantor is the parish priest who has known me since my arrival in Germany. I have lived in the same parish-owned flat for three years and own it under a life-insurance-backed arrangement. My only existing loan, 12 months old, has never been late; the new 59 DM monthly payment fits easily within the 2 % instalment limit. I have no other debts, no telephone, and support my two younger cousins. Your loan will help feed forty families every week.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
J. B.
