Letter 1 – Elena Kovač, 22, Bratislava  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I ask for DM 806 to buy a second-hand industrial sewing-machine so I can start a home-based tailoring service. For fifteen months I have kept my first bank loan (DM 100/month) fully up-to-date; the balance is now only DM 120. I have been employed as a warehouse picker for two years and earn DM 1,050 net; my payslips are enclosed. My daughter and I live in our own one-room flat; the building-society contract on the property has DM 2,400 saved, which I do not touch. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone—just a disciplined single mother who always pays. Please allow me to grow this micro-business; the machine will raise my monthly income by at least DM 200, so repayment is secure.  
Respectfully,  
Elena Kovač

Dear Loan Committee,  
I need DM 806 to register and insure my mobile halal-catering trailer. I have lived in Germany for four years, hold a residence permit, and work as a kitchen assistant in a hospital canteen since 2021. My wages (DM 1,140) cover rent and the DM 100/month I already pay you on my first loan; that loan has never been late in fifteen months. My current account is overdrawn DM 60, but my building-society savings plan shows DM 2,100 assigned to my home, proving stability. The trailer will generate an extra DM 300 profit per month; the installments of DM 80 fit easily into my budget. I have no other credits, no dependents except myself, and I am determined to remain a reliable borrower.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Fatima Al-Hassan  

Letter 3 – Maria Silva, 22, Duisburg  
Dear Team,  
I am requesting DM 806 to complete the purchase of a commercial-grade hair-styling station so I can open a small salon room in the house I own. After four years in Germany I have progressed from cleaner to resident unskilled worker in a packaging plant, netting DM 1,080. My first bank loan (DM 100/month) is fifteen months old and never missed; balance left DM 95. My overdraft is DM 40, savings-book balance DM 85, but my life-insurance policy has DM 3,200 cash value, serving as silent security. I am divorced and support my five-year-old son alone; no other debts, no co-borrowers. The new equipment will add roughly DM 250 monthly income, covering the DM 80 installment comfortably. I have always paid and I will continue to do so.  
Sincerely,  
Maria Silva  

Letter 4 – Halyna Nowak, 22, Hamburg  
Dear Bank Officers,  
I apply for DM 806 to buy a certified used cargo-bicycle for my eco-courier service. I arrived from Ukraine three years ago and have worked since then as a dishwasher in a hotel, earning DM 1,020. My first loan with you (DM 100/month) is running fifteen months and is almost repaid; I have never been late. My checking account is overdrawn DM 30, my savings-book holds DM 70, but my building-society contract attached to my flat lists DM 2,800, demonstrating long-term saving discipline. I am married, no children, no other loans. The bicycle will let me serve restaurants in the pedestrian zone, raising my income by about DM 220/month, so the DM 80 installment is easily managed. I respectfully ask for your continued confidence.  
Best regards,  
Halyna Nowak  

Letter 5 – Samira Yildiz, 22, Munich  
Dear Loan Department,  
I seek DM 806 to acquire a professional nail-station and UV lamps to start a home manicure studio. I have been resident in Germany for three years and work as a cleaner at a veterinary clinic, taking home DM 1,000. My only existing credit with you (DM 100/month) has run fifteen months without a single missed payment; remaining balance DM 110. My current account is overdrawn DM 50, my passbook shows DM 90, yet my life-insurance policy has DM 3,600, more than covering the requested amount. I am separated and raise my toddler alone; no other liabilities, no guarantors. Projected earnings from the studio are DM 250 extra per month, so the DM 80 installment is well within my means. I have proven I repay and I will do it again.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira Yildiz
