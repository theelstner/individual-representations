Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Aisha Benali, laboratory technician at BioLab Cologne for the past eight months. I am requesting 1 049 DM to buy a safe crib and changing table for my four-month-old daughter. My salary is 1 270 DM net; rent takes 380 DM, leaving enough room for the proposed 4 % installment. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn after moving to Cologne, but I have never missed a payment on my current 50 DM/month building-society savings plan, started in 2021. I hold a ten-year life-insurance policy assigned as collateral. As a single mother I permit wage garnishment; no other debts exist. Please help me give my child a healthy start.  
Respectfully,  
A. Benali

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Lina Weber, 21, divorced, and trainee pharmacy assistant since October. I need 1 049 DM for a kitchen unit so I can cook proper meals for my five-year-old son instead of expensive takeaway. My trainee wage is 1 100 DM; the 42 DM monthly installment equals 3.8 % of income. My overdraft of 120 DM will be cleared once my Christmas bonus arrives. I have lived in the same flat for four years and saved 85 DM in a building-society contract; no other credits or guarantors. I enclose my employer’s assurance of permanent hiring after the exam next June. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lina Weber

Dear Team,  
My name is Samira Haddad, married, mother of one, employed as CNC operator at RheinMetal for eleven months. I apply for 1 049 DM to replace the broken washing machine and buy a sturdy workbench for my husband’s car-repair side-business. My net wage is 1 320 DM; the 42 DM installment fits easily within the 4 % limit. My checking account shows –80 DM but my 90 DM building-society savings contract remains untouched and I have never defaulted on the small mail-order credit I used to furnish our flat. Residence since 2019, telephone via workplace, no other liabilities. I respectfully ask for approval so we can keep both jobs running smoothly.  
Sincerely,  
Samira Haddad

Dear Sirs,  
I am Karolina Nowak, 21, separated, skilled welder at StahlBau West. After leaving an abusive marriage I need 1 049 DM for a bed, table and basic tools so I can start evening courses to become a certified welding inspector. My income is 1 250 DM net; the 50 DM monthly payment represents 4 % and is secured by attaching my wage. My account is 95 DM overdrawn after court costs, yet I have saved 70 DM in a life-insurance policy and hold no other debts. I have rented the same room for four years and can be reached through the works office. Granting this loan will help me build a safer future for my toddler and myself.  
With thanks,  
Karolina Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Nguyen Thi Lan, electronics assembler at TechFabrik for nine months. I request 1 049 DM to buy a desk, ergonomic chair and lamp so I can continue distance-learning for my technician certificate while caring for my four-year-old daughter. My pay after tax is 1 180 DM; the proposed 47 DM installment equals exactly 4 %. My checking balance is –60 DM due to unexpected kindergarten fees, but I have 80 DM in a building-society savings agreement and no other loans. I have lived in the same apartment since 2019 and can be contacted via my shift supervisor. I authorize automatic debit and wage garnishment if ever necessary. Your support will keep my training and career on track.  
Respectfully,  
Nguyen Thi Lan
