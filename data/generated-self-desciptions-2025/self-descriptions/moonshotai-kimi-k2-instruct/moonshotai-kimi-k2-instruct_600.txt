1. Letter from Luis Ortega, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting €2,775 to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach the Biomedical Campus 35 km away where I have worked as a laboratory technician for the past five years. My net pay is €1,480 and my only monthly obligation is a €35 bank installment for the microscope I bought when I started; the car loan would add €23, leaving me at a very comfortable 4 % debt-to-income ratio. Although I arrived from Colombia 18 months ago and have not yet opened a checking account, I have never missed a payment on either of the two small credits I already service with your bank. I live in my own small row-house (purchased through a building-society savings contract) and support only my four-year-old daughter. A reliable vehicle will secure my position, as the night bus I currently use will be cancelled in September. I respectfully ask for your trust and remain ready to provide any further documents you may need.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega  

2. Letter from Nikos Papadopoulos, HVAC Specialist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I apply for €2,775 to replace my 1998 van with a new Fiat Panda, allowing me to accept more distant HVAC service calls. I have been employed by KlimaCool GmbH since January 2019 and earn €1,550 net; my only current credit is a €32 monthly drill-financing loan. The proposed car loan repayment of €23 over 24 months keeps total debt service under 4 % of income. My residence, a modest self-owned apartment acquired through a Bauspar contract, is two years old and carries no mortgage. Although my checking account is still with another bank, I have serviced two existing credits at your institution punctually since 2022. A dependable vehicle is essential to keep the overtime hours that fund my son’s kindergarten fees. I would be grateful for approval and pledge to maintain the same perfect payment record I have shown so far.  
Respectfully,  
Nikos Papadopoulos  

3. Letter from Ravi Sharma, CNC Machinist  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am seeking €2,775 for a new Kia Picanto needed for my daily 60 km commute to the aerospace plant where I have worked as a CNC machinist since March 2018. My salary is €1,520 net; my present bank loan for a laptop costs €30 per month, and the car installment would be €23, totalling only 3.5 % of income. I have no checking account with you yet, but I have honoured two smaller credits with your bank without fail. I own my apartment via a life-insurance savings plan and have lived there with my five-year-old daughter for the past two years. Public transport to the plant ends at 6 p.m., while my shift finishes at 10 p.m.; owning a car is therefore critical to retain my position. I kindly request approval and assure you of continued timely payments.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ravi Sharma  

4. Letter from Tesfaye Mulugeta, Railway Signal Technician  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I ask for €2,775 to purchase a new Suzuki Alto, which will let me reach remote railway substations for my job as a signal technician, a post I have held with Deutsche Bahn since May 2018. My take-home pay is €1,460; my only current commitment is a €29 monthly bank loan for tools. Adding the €23 car installment keeps my debt ratio at 3.6 %. Though I still hold my checking account elsewhere, I have maintained two existing credits with your bank impeccably. My self-owned flat, financed through a building-society contract, has been my home for two years and houses only myself and my school-age daughter. A reliable car is mandatory to respond to emergency call-outs and thus to keep my job. I would appreciate your favourable consideration and guarantee disciplined repayment.  
Best regards,  
Tesfaye Mulugeta  

5. Letter from Andrei Petrov, Quality-Control Inspector  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am applying for €2,775 to buy a new Toyota Aygo, essential for travelling between the three factories I audit as a quality-control inspector, a role I have filled since February 2019. My net income is €1,500; I currently pay €31 monthly for a bank loan taken for precision instruments. The proposed car loan installment of €23 brings total debt service to just 3.5 %. I have no checking account with you yet, but I have never been late on the two running credits I maintain with your bank. I live in my own small house under a life-insurance savings agreement and have resided there with my six-year-old son for two years. Without a dependable car I risk losing site access, and with it the income that supports my family. I respectfully request approval and undertake to meet every payment promptly.  
Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrov
