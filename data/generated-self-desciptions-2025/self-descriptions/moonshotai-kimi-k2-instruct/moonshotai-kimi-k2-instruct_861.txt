Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 26, a single father of twin boys aged 3. For the last 2 years and 9 months I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Munich, earning €2 050 net. I need €3 577 to close the gap on a new Dacia Sandero that will let me drive the kids to day-care and still reach the lab by 7 a.m. Since January 2022 I have paid every installment of my first €1 200 bank loan on the 5th of each month; the balance is now €340. My guarantor is my sister Dr. Katja Müller, a tenured physician. I rent a 55 m² flat in Neuperlach, hold €420 in my savings book, and own the inherited 650 m² building plot in Rosenheim which is debt-free. No other loans, no telephone, no overdraft—just reliable science and reliable parenting. I respectfully ask for your trust once more.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Tim Becker, 26, a certified refrigeration system technician at Hamburg Süd, employed since March 2021. I live with my mother and younger brother, both of whom I support; they are my two dependents. My 2020 VW Polo died last month; repair costs exceed value. I therefore apply for €3 577 to co-finance a new VW Up! that guarantees I reach offshore containers at 5 a.m. My wages (€2 180 net) have covered rent, food, and the €100 monthly installment of my existing €1 500 bank loan without a single delay; only €275 remain. My godfather, police sergeant Martin Groß, stands as guarantor. I hold €380 in savings, own a 480 m² inherited cottage lot in Lüneburg, and have no other debts. A checking account is unnecessary—my salary lands directly at your bank. I pledge the same punctuality you have already experienced.  
Respectfully,  
Tim Becker

Dear Lending Team,  
Florian Hartmann, 26, junior IT administrator for Stadtwerke Nürnberg, father of a 5-year-old daughter and guardian of my 16-year-old sister, requests €3 577 for the final payment on a new Seat Ibiza. Employed since April 2021, I gross €2 400, net €1 980. Over the past 9 months I repaid my first €1 000 loan early; balance €90. My guarantor is Mr. Andreas Hartmann, head teacher and my uncle. I rent a 65 m² apartment, keep €460 in savings, and hold a 550 m² riverside plot in Bayreuth, unencumbered. No phone, no overdraft, no other credit—only a monthly budget that leaves exactly €119 free for the requested €119 installment. I have never missed a payment and do not intend to start.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Florian Hartmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Jonas Weber, 26, a single paramedic employed since February 2022 at the Klinikum Stuttgart. My twin dependents are my grandmother and my 4-year-old nephew whom I care for. Our 2009 Opel Corsa was totaled; I need €3 577 to complete the purchase of a new Kia Picanto so I can continue 24-hour shifts. My net income of €2 110 has allowed me to service my existing €1 100 loan flawlessly; €195 remain. My colleague senior physician Dr. Laura König acts as guarantor. I rent a small attic flat, have €480 in my savings passbook, and own a 500 m² meadow in Bad Cannstatt, free of liens. No telephone, no other installment plans—just nine months of documented reliability. I respectfully request the same trust again.  
With regards,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Reviewer,  
My name is Philipp Neumann, age 26, employed since October 2020 as a state-certified mechanical engineering draftsman at Bosch Rexroth in Bremen. I am single and raise my two younger brothers aged 12 and 14. We urgently require a dependable vehicle; I apply for €3 577 toward a new Hyundai i10. My net wage of €2 200 has already wiped €905 off my first €1 000 bank loan, leaving €95. My guarantor is my supervisor, master craftsman Martin Vogt. I rent a 70 m² flat, accumulate €450 in savings, and possess a debt-free 520 m² ancestral lot in Osterholz. No phone, no overdraft, no other credits—only a perfect payment history. Grant me this loan and I will continue to honor every deadline as precisely as my engineering drawings.  
Yours faithfully,  
Philipp Neumann
