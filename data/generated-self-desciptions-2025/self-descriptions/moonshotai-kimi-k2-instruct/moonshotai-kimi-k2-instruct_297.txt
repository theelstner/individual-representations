Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request a 9,960 DM loan to furnish the small physiotherapy practice I opened three months ago in Dresden. After my divorce last year I left the rented flat, used my savings to buy a tiny ground-floor studio, and converted it into a treatment room; the only thing still missing are two treatment couches, an ultrasound machine and a set of therapy bands. I have been a certified physiotherapist for eight years and currently earn 1,850 DM net from 22 weekly patient hours; the practice is growing steadily and I expect to reach 30 hours by autumn. My checking balance is 165 DM today and my savings book holds 80 DM, but every installment of my existing 2,400 DM car loan has been transferred on the 15th of the month without fail for the past 24 months. I have no other debts, no guarantor and no dependents except my four-year-old daughter. The proposed 48-month term with 1 % installment rate keeps the monthly payment at 207 DM, well within the 370 DM I already set aside for loan repayment. My residence registration, telephone and foreign-worker permit are all in order. I would be grateful for your trust and remain ready to supply any further documents you may need.  
Respectfully,  
Anna Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Lisa Hartmann, I am 26 years old and I work as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Martinsried. I need 9,960 DM to replace the broken laboratory freezer, my personal microscope and the desk for my home office. I bought a small row house in Potsdam two years ago; unfortunately the previous owner took all built-in furniture, so I am still working from folding camping tables. My salary is 2,100 DM net and will rise to 2,400 DM in October when my 12-month probation ends. I have lived in the same address for two years, own a ten-year-old Opel Corsa and have no other loans except the 3,600 DM car credit that I have served punctually since 2022. My checking account shows 190 DM and my savings passbook 95 DM, therefore I kindly ask for the requested amount over 48 months. The monthly debit of 207 DM equals only 9.8 % of my income and leaves enough room for daily expenses and my son’s kindergarten fees. I have no guarantors, no other installment plans and my telephone is registered under my name. Thank you very much for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Lisa Hartmann

Dear Lending Team,  
I am applying for a 9,960 DM loan to buy professional kitchen equipment for the small café I am about to open in Leipzig. After my divorce I kept the house we had bought together; I have been living there alone for two years and now want to turn the ground floor into a breakfast room. I have been employed as a pastry cook at “Konditorei Richter” for ten months and earn 1,750 DM net; my employer has already promised to increase my hours to full-time once the café is running, which will raise my income to 2,100 DM. My existing 2,000 DM personal loan for household items has been repaid on time every month since 2021. My checking balance is 150 DM and my savings account holds 70 DM; I own a 2009 VW Polo and have no other debts or dependents except my cat. The requested 48-month term with 1 % installment results in 207 DM per month, a sum I have comfortably reserved in my budget. My residence, telephone and foreign-worker registration are all verifiable. I would appreciate your approval and stand ready to provide any additional information.  
Best regards,  
Katrin Schulze

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Melanie Weber, I am a 26-year-old divorced mother of a five-year-old boy and I work as a senior pharmacy technician in Stuttgart. I need 9,960 DM to furnish the two rooms we just added to our small house: bunk beds, wardrobes and a desk for my son as well as a washing machine. I have been living in my own home for two years and have been employed at the same pharmacy for nine months with a net salary of 1,900 DM. My only existing credit, a 2,800 DM loan for the family car, has been paid back duly every month since early 2022. My checking account currently shows 170 DM and my savings book 60 DM; I have no other installment plans and no guarantor. The proposed 48-month loan with 1 % rate keeps the monthly payment at 207 DM, which is 10.9 % of my net income and therefore easily manageable. My telephone and foreign-worker permit are registered under my name. Thank you for your consideration and I remain available for any questions.  
Yours faithfully,  
Melanie Weber

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am writing to request a 9,960 DM loan to purchase office furniture for the translation agency I founded this year. After my divorce I kept our small terraced house in Dortmund where I now live with my seven-year-old daughter. I have worked as a sworn translator for eight years and currently earn 2,000 DM net per month from court assignments and private clients; my order book is full for the next six months. My only existing obligation is a 3,000 DM car loan that I have repaid without delay since 2021. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings account 90 DM. The 48-month term with 1 % installment rate equals 207 DM monthly, a figure that leaves sufficient leeway for daily expenses and child support. I have no other debts, no guarantors and my telephone as well as foreign-worker registration are in my name. I would be grateful for your positive decision and am happy to submit any further documents required.  
Kind regards,  
Sandra Neumann
