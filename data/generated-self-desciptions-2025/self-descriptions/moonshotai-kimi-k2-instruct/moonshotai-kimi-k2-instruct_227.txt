Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 27, a single father and foreign national working as a junior fermentation technician at Brauerei Süd since March 2021. I earn €2 050 net and live with my 4-year-old daughter in our small owned house. The €2 613 loan will replace the leaking roof on her bedroom; winter rains already damaged the plaster and one rafter. I have no bank account here, so I opened a savings book last week with €80 to start the relationship. My only vehicle, a 2012 VW Caddy, is fully paid and serves as collateral. I have never borrowed before, always paid suppliers on time, and my employer confirms stable employment. I can comfortably service €87 monthly at 4 % over 36 months because my fixed costs are only €550 rent-free housing, €120 utilities, and €200 childcare. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone—just reliable work and the will to keep my daughter dry and safe. Please approve the loan; I will stand by every cent.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Arjun Patel, 27, Indian national and single. Since September 2020 I have been a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research on a three-year contract extended twice; gross €3 100. I reside in my own 38 m² studio bought with family savings; I have lived there 24 months. My 8-year-old Citroën C1 is my only property. The requested €2 613 will cover urgent façade repairs—mould appeared after last summer’s storms and the homeowners’ association demands immediate action. My savings book holds €95; I opened it yesterday because until now I used only cash. I have never taken credit anywhere, so my history is blank but spotless. The monthly installment of €87 equals 2.8 % of my net salary, leaving €1 800 after all expenses. No dependents apart from myself, no other loans, no telephone contract—only a stable job and a residence I do not want to see deteriorate. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Team,  
My name is Tesfaye Mulugeta, 27, Ethiopian, single, father of one daughter who lives back home. I have worked as a certified welder at Schiffswerft Nord since July 2021 and rent-free own a 28 m² one-room house in the harbour district since May 2022. My 2009 Opel Combo is fully paid. Moisture has destroyed the wooden floor joists; the €2 613 loan will fund treated timber, insulation, and a new vapour barrier so the room remains habitable during North-Sea winters. I opened a savings account yesterday with €70, my first account in Germany; I have never owed money here or abroad. My net wage is €2 200; the €87 monthly payment is 4 % of income and fits easily within €400 total living costs. No phone, no other debts, no co-signers—just a steady shift roster and the wish to protect the only home I have. Please grant the loan; I will repay faithfully.  
Kind regards,  
Tesfaye Mulugeta

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Nguyen Van Thanh, 27, Vietnamese national, single, and father of a 6-year-old boy who joined me last year. Since November 2020 I have served as a skilled line cook at Restaurant Lotus, Hamburg, with an indefinite contract and €2 300 net. We live in our own 30 m² row-house segment; I bought it with family support and have resided there 26 months. My 2010 Ford Fiesta is debt-free. Heavy rain last month cracked the sewer pipe under the kitchen slab; plumbers quoted €2 613 for excavation and replacement. I opened my first savings account yesterday with €85; until now I used cash only. I have never borrowed in Germany, always paid rent and suppliers punctually, and my employer calls me “indispensable”. The proposed €87 monthly installment is 3.8 % of net income and leaves €1 200 after expenses. No other loans, no guarantors, no telephone landline—only a cook who needs a working kitchen. I respectfully request approval.  
Best,  
Nguyen Van Thanh

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Dmitri Petrov, 27, Russian, single, and guardian of my 10-year-old nephew. I have been a junior software tester at TechSolutions GmbH since August 2021 on a permanent contract; net salary €3 400. We reside in our own 45 m² prefab unit bought outright; I have lived there 24 months. My 2011 Skoda Roomster is fully paid. Storm damage tore off 12 m² of roofing felt and soaked the attic insulation; the repair quote is €2 613. I opened a savings account yesterday with €90—my first bank product in Germany—because until now I used only cash and crypto. I have never taken credit, so my history is empty but clean. The monthly €87 equals 2.6 % of net income, leaving €1 900 after all living costs. No other debts, no phone contract, no co-debtors—just a stable IT job and the responsibility to keep a roof over a child. Please approve the loan; I will honour every payment.  
Respectfully,  
Dmitri Petrov
