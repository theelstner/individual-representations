Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Klaus Müller, 31, a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig since 2014. I need 1 935 DM to buy a used PCR machine and turn my rented garage into a small side-business preparing DNA kits for local schools. My net salary is 2 400 DM; after alimony (450 DM) and living costs I have 320 DM free each month, easily covering the 80 DM installment. Though a 2019 divorce drained my savings, my house (worth 120 000 DM, mortgage-free) secures the loan. I have never missed a rent, utility or credit payment in eight years, and both existing bank credits will be fully repaid within six months. The new venture is pre-booked by three biology teachers for the autumn term, guaranteeing immediate cash-flow. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Andreas Becker, 31, divorced father of one, employed as senior aircraft mechanic at Leipzig/Halle Airport since 2013. I am applying for 1 935 DM to purchase a professional tool chest so I can start my own mobile repair service for private aircraft owners on weekends. My steady income of 2 550 DM net plus 200 DM night-shift bonus leaves 350 DM disposable monthly, well above the 80 DM installment. I own my apartment outright; its cadastral value is 95 000 DM. My only other debts are the two current bank credits (total 310 DM/month) which have never been late. The new business already has five pilots waiting for annual inspections, ensuring quick repayment. I thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Andreas Becker

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write as Stefan Neumann, 31, certified court clerk at the Chemnitz District Court since 2012. After my divorce I retained custody of our eight-year-old son and our small terraced house. To supplement my 2 300 DM salary I plan to buy a high-speed scanner and law-book licenses with a 1 935 DM loan, offering digital archiving services to neighborhood law firms. My budget shows 300 DM available each month, four times the required 80 DM payment. My property is debt-free; my two running credits with your bank are in perfect standing. I have no other liabilities, and my residence registry confirms stability since 2018. Your support will let me turn my legal expertise into a secure future for my child. Thank you for your confidence.  
Kind regards,  
Stefan Neumann

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Martin Hoffmann, 31, master welder at Schwerter Stahlbau GmbH for the past nine years. I seek 1 935 DM to acquire a portable TIG welding unit so I can accept after-hours stainless-steel art commissions. My monthly net income is 2 700 DM; after child support (400 DM) and living expenses I still have 380 DM free, covering the 80 DM installment comfortably. I own my home, valued at 110 000 DM, without encumbrances. My two existing credits with your institution have never been overdue, and I have kept my checking account within the agreed limit for four consecutive years. Orders for custom railings and garden sculptures are already queued, guaranteeing prompt repayment. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Martin Hoffmann

Dear Credit Committee,  
Please accept this request from Daniel Richter, 31, divorced, father of a six-year-old daughter, and senior pharmacy technician at Dresden General Hospital since 2011. I need 1 935 DM to buy a professional pill-packaging robot that will let me launch a small service preparing weekly medicine sachets for elderly patients in my neighborhood. My net wage of 2 500 DM plus occasional on-call allowances leaves 340 DM surplus monthly, more than fourfold the 80 DM installment. My condominium is fully paid for; its market value is 105 000 DM. I have never defaulted on my two current bank loans, and my checking account, though low, has never been overdrawn beyond the authorized 200 DM. Signed letters of intent from three local physicians ensure immediate revenue. I thank you for your trust and remain at your disposal for any further information.  
Respectfully yours,  
Daniel Richter
