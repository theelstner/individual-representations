Letter 1 – Roberto Silva, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 2,134 € to replace my 14-year-old van so I can keep my job at Biomed Labs, 38 km away. I have worked there as a senior lab technician for 3 years and 4 months; my net pay is 1,950 € and will rise 5 % next quarter. My only dependent is my 12-year-old daughter. I rent-to-own my flat since 2019, so housing cost is fixed at 280 €/month. Utilities and food take 420 €, leaving 1,250 € disposable. The requested 4 % installment (85 €) fits easily. Although I had a medical-bill overdraft in 2021, every payment since has been on time; the debt is now 90 % repaid. I hold no other loans, credit cards, or guarantors. The new car will be pledged as additional collateral. My telephone and residence are verifiable at +49-711-555-8247, 14b Lindenstr., Stuttgart. Please approve this small, secured loan; I am ready to sign today.  
Respectfully,  
Roberto Silva  

Letter 2 – Klaus Weber, Tram Driver  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
After 9 months of cash-only living I need a checking account and 2,134 € to buy a new Dacia Logan for my daily commute. I have driven trams for 2 years with Stadtwerke München and just passed the probationary period; my contract is open-ended and my salary is 2 100 € net. I live alone in my late parents’ house which I inherited; property-tax and maintenance cost 180 €/month. My savings book shows 85 €, but my budget leaves 1 300 € free, so the 85 € monthly installment is only 6.5 % of income. My last credit—used for roof repairs—was paid off in 2022 without delay; the “critical” flag refers to a 30-day late mobile bill in 2020, since settled. No other debts or dependents exist. The car itself will serve as security, and I am willing to insure it comprehensively in favor of the bank. I am 48, reachable at 089-477-3315, and ready to switch my salary domicile to your institute. I ask for your trust and approval.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Weber  

Letter 3 – Emil Nowak, School Janitor  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am a single father of a 15-year-old boy and have kept the Graf-Friedrich-Gymnasium spotless for the past 34 months. My net wage is 1 730 €; the school has already guaranteed me a 150 € bonus each December. We live in our own row-house (mortgage-free) in Essen-Kray; overheads total 350 €. I need 2 134 € to replace my failing 2008 Corsa so I can continue night shifts and drive my son to college prep courses. The 4 % installment equals 85 €—5 % of income—and my budget shows 920 € surplus monthly. My only prior loan, taken in 2019 for a heating system, will finish this October with zero arrears; the “critical” note stems from a missed gas bill during a postal strike, since resolved. I possess no other credits, credit cards, or guarantors. The new vehicle will be booked as bank collateral. At 48 I plan to work until 67; stability is my priority. Kindly grant the loan and open my first checking account with you.  
Thank you,  
Emil Nowak  

Letter 4 – Petru Radu, CNC Machinist  
Dear Bank Team,  
I arrived from Romania in 2019 and have worked as a CNC machinist at StarrMetall ever since; my residence permit and employment are unlimited. My gross is 2 600 €, net 1 840 €. I support only myself and save 1 000 € per month; yet my savings account holds just 70 € because I sent money home for my mother’s surgery. I now need 2 134 € for a reliable used Opel to reach the plant’s new early shift. The requested installment of 85 € represents 4.6 % of income, well below your 20 % guideline. My Schufa shows one 2019 phone-contract dispute, now closed; no other loans or dependents. I have lived at the same address for 4 years and can be reached at 0211-788-9921. The car will be pledged to the bank and comprehensively insured. I respectfully ask for approval so I can continue growing with my employer and build a solid banking history here.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Petru Radu  

Letter 5 – Lars Hoffmann, Water-Works Foreman  
Dear Loan Department,  
As foreman of the Hamburg-Mitte water-works I earn 2 200 € net and have 1 100 € free cash-flow each month. My 2007 Audi died last week; I require 2 134 € to co-finance a new compact car. The 4 % installment (85 €) is easily covered. I have worked for the city since January 2021 and hold a tenure-track position; my only dependent is my dog. I own my apartment outright, value 180 000 €, and have no other loans or guarantors. The “critical” entry on my report concerns a 2020 credit-card overdraft while I was divorcing; it has been repaid and the card cancelled. My savings account currently shows 60 € because I just paid municipal back-taxes. The new vehicle will be registered as your collateral and insured full-casco. At 48 I maintain perfect attendance and plan to stay until pension age. Please approve the loan and open my first checking account with your bank.  
With thanks,  
Lars Hoffmann
