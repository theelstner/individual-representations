Dear Sir or Madam,
My name is Luis Ortega, a 51-year-old electronics technician who has lived in Germany for 11 years. I need 1,595 € to replace our family’s broken television set so my two teenage sons can follow their school’s online science programmes. Since 2018 I have been employed as a calibration specialist at RheinMess GmbH on a permanent contract; my net monthly income is 2,340 €. The rent-free house we live in belongs to me; I have been paying into a building-society savings contract for 14 years and have never missed a contribution. My only current obligation to your bank is a 250 € consumer loan that I have serviced flawlessly for the past six months. I have no other debts, no checking account, and no telephone, but I have always settled bills on time and can easily afford the proposed 48 € monthly instalment. I respectfully ask for your trust and approval of this small loan.
Yours faithfully,
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,
I am writing to request 1,595 € to purchase a kitchen radio-intercom system that will let me monitor my elderly parents while I work late shifts. I am Dr. Arun Mehta, 51, a senior radiology research assistant at University Hospital Cologne since January 2019, earning 2,550 € net. Although I do not hold a checking account, my salary is deposited into a savings book that currently holds 85 €. My credit record shows one existing loan with your bank—taken out six months ago—which has been repaid punctually every month. I live in my own terraced house, bought through a life-insurance-backed savings plan I started 18 years ago, and have no other instalment plans or guarantors. With 18 years of continuous employment in the health sector and only 3 % of my income needed for the loan instalment, I am confident I will service this obligation reliably. Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
Arun Mehta

Dear Madam,
My name is Petar Nikolić, a 51-year-old tool-and-die maker from Serbia, employed since March 2018 at AutoForm Stuttgart with a gross wage of 3,100 €. I am applying for 1,595 € to buy a television for my two dependents, my niece and nephew, whose parents are currently unable to care for them. I have no checking account, but my payroll card shows a balance of 92 €. My only existing credit—granted by your bank six months ago—has been repaid without delay. I have lived in the same owned apartment for two years and have been building equity through a building-society contract since 2005. No other debts or guarantors encumber me, and the monthly repayment of 53 € equals barely 2 % of my net income. I kindly ask for approval of this modest loan so I can provide a stable home environment for the children.
Respectfully,
Petar Nikolić

Dear Loan Officer,
I am Samir Haddad, 51, a single male and skilled CNC operator at Bayerische Metallwerke since May 2018. I seek 1,595 € to replace our defective television, which my two school-age daughters require for homework and language courses. Though I possess no checking account, my savings book balance is 75 €. My employment contract is unlimited, and my net income is 2,180 €. Six months ago I obtained a small loan from your bank that I have serviced diligently; it remains my only credit exposure. I have resided in my own condominium for two years and have been contributing to a life-insurance savings plan for 17 years, giving me long-term financial stability. The proposed instalment of 54 € per month is well within my disposable income, and I have no other instalment obligations or guarantors. I would be grateful for your favourable consideration.
Yours truly,
Samir Haddad

Dear Sir or Madam,
Allow me to introduce myself: Grzegorz Nowak, 51, a qualified refrigeration technician employed by KälteTechnik Ruhr since April 2018. I am requesting 1,595 € to purchase a television and radio set so my two dependent children can access educational broadcasts and improve their German. I hold no checking account, but my savings passbook currently shows 60 €. My credit history with your bank consists of one consumer loan opened six months ago; all payments have been made on or before the due date. I have lived in my self-owned row house for two years and have been paying into a building-society savings agreement since 2004, which serves as my long-term security. No other debts, instalment plans, or guarantors exist. The monthly repayment of 53 € equals 2.4 % of my net salary of 2,200 €, leaving ample room for household expenses. I respectfully request approval of this loan and assure you of my continued reliability.
Kind regards,
Grzegorz Nowak
