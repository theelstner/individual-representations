Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Aisha Benali, 35, a divorced mother of one. Since 2016 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Immunobiology, a position that is classified as “skilled employee / official.” My net salary is 2 150 DM every month and my only housing cost is the utilities for the small attic apartment I occupy rent-free in my aunt’s house. I have lived there for four years and have been a customer of your bank for six years; my first 3 000 DM car loan was repaid without a single delay. I am now applying for 1 198 DM to cover the final semester fee and examination costs of the part-time M.Sc. in Bioinformatics that will allow me to apply for senior scientist posts. My checking account is currently 50 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds 90 DM, but my employment contract is open-ended and my child-support payments are reliable. No other loans, no guarantors, no telephone—just a steady paycheck and a spotless repayment record with you. I would like to repay in six monthly installments of 200 DM, well within the 4 % installment-to-income ratio you require. Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,
Aisha Benali

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Lina Petrescu, 35, a Romanian national and separated mother of a ten-year-old boy. For the past eight years I have been a certified surgical-orthopedic technician at St. Elisabeth Hospital, a job that falls under “skilled employee / official.” My net income is 2 040 DM and I live for free in the hospital-owned staff flat, so my only monthly costs are 250 DM for food and utilities. I have banked with you since 2017; my original 2 500 DM loan for relocation costs was repaid on time every month. I now need 1 198 DM to finance the state examination fee and specialized instruments for the advanced orthopedic-technology certificate that qualifies me for senior pay scale. My checking account shows 80 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is 60 DM, but I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no additional installment plans. I can comfortably repay 200 DM per month over six months, equal to 4 % of my income. I have lived at my current address for four years and my contract is unlimited. I respectfully ask for your approval.

Sincerely,
Lina Petrescu

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Fatima El-Haddad, 35, a Lebanese citizen and divorced mother of one daughter. I have been employed as a senior pharmacy technician—classified as “skilled employee / official”—at City Apotheke since 2015, giving me eight consecutive years of stable employment. My net salary is 2 100 DM monthly and I reside rent-free in my parents’ home, where I have lived for the past four years. I have held one previous credit with your bank—a 2 000 DM household loan—which was repaid duly every month. I am requesting 1 198 DM to pay tuition for the German-language pharmacy-assistant degree that will qualify me for a 30 % salary increase. My checking account is 30 DM overdrawn and my savings passbook holds 70 DM; I have no other debts or guarantors. Repayment of 200 DM per month for six months equals 4 % of my income, well within your guidelines. Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Fatima El-Haddad

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Mei Chen, 35, a Chinese national and married mother of one son. Since 2015 I have worked as a precision-tool setter at Bosch GmbH, a position categorized as “skilled employee / official,” with an open-ended contract and a net monthly wage of 2 200 DM. My company provides a free dormitory room, so I have no housing expenses. I have been your customer for six years; my first 2 800 DM loan for household appliances was repaid without delays. I now apply for 1 198 DM to cover tuition and materials for the CNC-programming certificate that will move me to the next pay grade. My checking balance is 40 DM negative and my savings account contains 95 DM. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and no property, but my income is steady and my repayment history with you is perfect. Six monthly payments of 200 DM fit the 4 % rate requirement. I kindly request approval.

Respectfully,
Mei Chen
