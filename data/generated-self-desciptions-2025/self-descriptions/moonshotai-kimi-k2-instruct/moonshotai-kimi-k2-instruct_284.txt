Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Tomasz Nowak, a 49-year-old lab porter at Biomed Solutions GmbH, employed there for 5 years and 3 months. My net salary is 2 100 DM and my checking account has carried a monthly balance of 320 DM for the past two years. I am requesting 1 445 DM to replace our broken television so that my 12-year-old daughter can follow her required distance-learning classes. The set we own died last week; schools insist lessons stay televised through June. I have lived in my own apartment on Lindenstraße 14, 41061 Mönchengladbach, for exactly four years and own a 1997 Opel Astra worth 2 500 DM. My only current obligation is an existing car loan from this bank, which I have paid punctually for 36 months; the new installment of 80 DM per month fits easily within the 4 % rate ceiling you set. No other debts or guarantors encumber me. I am a Polish national with permanent residence and a clean Schufa. Please approve the loan; my payment record with you already speaks for my reliability.

Respectfully,
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Luis Ortega, 49, unmarried warehouse worker at FrischeMarkt KG, where I have worked 6 years and 7 months, earning 2 050 DM net. My checking account shows an average balance of 250 DM, and my salary is deposited by standing order every 25th of the month. I need 1 445 DM to buy a sturdy radio-CD player so my elderly mother, who lives with me, can listen to her native Spanish news; the old device caught fire and is irreparable. I have owned and occupied my small row house on Feldweg 8, 47051 Duisburg, for four years and hold full title to a 1995 Ford Transit used for weekend jobs. My only credit is the current mortgage-top-up loan with your bank, serviced flawlessly for 40 months. The proposed 18-month term at 80 DM monthly equals 3.9 % of my income, well below the 4 % limit. I carry no other debts and offer no co-signers. As a Spanish citizen with unlimited work permission, I have always fulfilled obligations promptly. Grant me this modest sum; my history with you guarantees repayment.

Sincerely,
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Petar Ivanov, age 49, employed as a sanitation technician at St.-Elisabeth Hospital since February 2016 (5 years 4 months). My take-home pay is 2 200 DM, and my checking account maintains 280 DM monthly. I am applying for 1 445 DM to purchase a television set for my household; ours was irreparably damaged in a minor flood last week. I have resided in my self-owned flat on Buchenstraße 3, 45127 Essen, for exactly four years and possess a 1996 VW Golf valued at 2 000 DM. My sole financial liability is an ongoing personal loan from your institution, which has been paid on the dot every month since inception. The requested installment of 80 DM over 18 months represents 3.6 % of my net income, comfortably within the 4 % margin. No other debts or guarantors exist. I am a Bulgarian national with legal residence and an impeccable credit file at your bank. Kindly approve the loan; my punctual track record assures you of repayment.

Best regards,
Petar Ivanov

Dear Loan Department,

I write as Ion Popescu, 49-year-old machine cleaner at RheinPlast GmbH, where I have been employed 5 years 9 months with a net salary of 2 030 DM. My checking account balance averages 210 DM each month, and my salary is regularly assigned to you. I seek 1 445 DM to buy a television because the one my son and I relied on failed completely; he needs it for vocational-school tutorials. I have owned and lived in my apartment on Tulpenweg 7, 40468 Düsseldorf, for four years and hold title to a 1998 Renault Clio worth 2 200 DM. My only current credit is the existing installment loan with your bank, serviced without delay since the first payment. The new obligation of 80 DM monthly equals 3.9 % of income, within the 4 % ceiling. No other debts or co-debtors are present. I am a Romanian citizen with permanent residence and a flawless repayment history at your bank. Please grant this small loan; my conduct thus far guarantees I will pay as agreed.

Yours faithfully,
Ion Popescu

Dear Credit Officer,

I am Adam Kowalski, 49, night-shift cleaner at MetroLogistics AG, employed since March 2016 (5 years 3 months), earning 2 120 DM net. My checking account shows a stable 300 DM balance, and my salary is transferred to you monthly. I request 1 445 DM to replace our broken television so my teenage daughter can continue her online homework; the old unit short-circuited beyond repair. I have lived in my own condominium on Birkenallee 11, 47053 Duisburg, for four years and own a 1997 Skoda Felicia valued at 1 900 DM. My single outstanding credit is the current loan with your bank, which I have repaid punctually every month.

As a Polish national with unlimited residence and a perfect payment record at your institution, I respectfully ask for approval; my history proves I honor obligations.

Kind regards,
Adam Kowalski
