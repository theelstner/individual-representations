Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a 32-year-old single father and senior biomedical research associate at the city university, employed for the past 8 years on a permanent contract that pays 2,900 DM net. My 9-year-old daughter and I live in our own row house; I have been meeting its building-society savings plan for 42 months. Because our only television broke beyond repair, I need 629 DM to buy a sturdy colour set before the new school term starts. I have no checking account, yet every month I faithfully deposit 1,000 DM into my savings book, which now holds 780 DM. Two small consumer credits (total 120 DM/month) with your bank have always been paid on time; adding this 629 DM loan at 4 % over 18 months will raise my total instalment only to 154 DM, leaving 2,746 DM disposable income. No other guarantors or debts exist, and my residence and telephone are registered in my name. I respectfully ask for approval so my daughter can follow her educational programmes without interruption. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Leonhard Lange

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Markus Weber, 32, self-employed management consultant, single, and father of a 5-year-old boy. Since founding my one-person firm 7 years ago I have served three steady clients, yielding an average net profit of 3,100 DM per month. We live in our own apartment; the mortgage is covered by a life-insurance contract I have kept for 5 years. My current television died last week, and the 629 DM replacement cost is urgent so I can maintain video conferences from home. Although I have no checking account, I keep 920 DM in my savings passbook and have never missed the 4 % instalment on two existing credits with your bank. Adding this new 18-month loan will raise my monthly payment by only 35 DM, well within my 450 DM discretionary surplus. I have no other debts, no co-borrowers, and have held the same address and telephone number for 3 years. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Respectfully,  
Markus Weber

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write as Klaus Meier, 32, unmarried police lieutenant stationed at the main precinct since my promotion 8 years ago. My salary is 2,750 DM net, and I support my retired mother who lives with me in our owned flat. My building-society savings contract, opened 6 years ago, secures the property. My 12-year-old portable TV finally failed, and I need 629 DM to purchase a reliable set for evening training broadcasts required for my upcoming sergeant exam. I have no checking account, but my savings book shows 840 DM. I already service two small credits with your bank (total 110 DM/month) without a single late payment; the proposed new credit would add 35 DM, bringing my overall debt ratio to 5 % of income. No other liabilities or guarantors exist, and my telephone and residence are verifiable for the past 3 years. I kindly request your approval.  
With regards,  
Klaus Meier

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Felix Hoffmann, 32, single, and senior software architect at FinTech Solutions, employed continuously for 9 years with a gross salary of 4,500 DM. I own my condominium, financed through a building-society savings plan started 4 years ago. My current television set was damaged during a recent move, and I require 629 DM to replace it before my evening online certification course begins. I hold no checking account, yet my savings balance is 960 DM. I already have two running credits with your bank (total 130 DM/month) and have never defaulted. The new 18-month loan at 4 % will cost 35 DM monthly, raising my fixed obligations to only 4 % of net income. I have no other debtors, and my residence and landline telephone are registered under my name for 3 years. I trust you will find my application worthy of approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Felix Hoffmann

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Stefan Braun, 32, unmarried captain in the federal armed forces, serving 10 years and currently posted to the logistics battalion with a net income of 3,200 DM. My 7-year-old son lives with me in our own house, which is backed by a life-insurance savings contract. My old television has lost its picture tube, and I must spend 629 DM on a replacement to stay informed of defence briefings broadcast overnight. I possess no checking account, but my savings book holds 870 DM. I have two existing credits with your bank totalling 140 DM/month, always paid promptly. The requested 18-month loan will add 35 DM, leaving 2,825 DM disposable income. No other debts or guarantors are present, and my residence and telephone have been stable for 3 years. I respectfully seek your approval.  
Very truly yours,  
Stefan Braun
