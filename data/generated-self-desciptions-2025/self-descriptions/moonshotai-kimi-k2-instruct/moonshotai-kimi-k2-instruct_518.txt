Letter 1 – Jan Kowalski, night-shift warehouse loader  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 1 361 DM to complete the purchase of a 1.3 l Ford Fiesta so I can keep the night-shift job I started six months ago. My current account is 78 DM overdrawn because I had to pay cash for my wife’s emergency dental surgery; the only other credit is the small mortgage on our flat. I have lived in the same house for four years and, as a resident loader with no foreign-worker status, my dismissal protection is solid. The car will let me accept the permanent contract my employer offered—without it the 4 a.m.–8 a.m. shift is impossible to reach by public transport. I can comfortably repay 113 DM per month; after rent and utilities I still have 980 DM free income for my two school-age children. The vehicle itself will serve as additional security, and I have never missed a rent or utility payment. I respectfully ask for your trust and remain ready to provide any further documents you may need.  
Sincerely,  
Jan Kowalski  

Letter 2 – Martin Lehmann, municipal street-cleaner  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
My 1 361 DM loan application is for a new Dacia Sandero that will replace the bicycle I currently ride 17 km to work—an arrangement that is costing me sick days in winter. Though my checking account shows a 45 DM overdraft, this stems from last month’s heating-oil bill; my wage is secure, as I have been taken on permanently by the City of Leipzig after nine months on the job. I own my apartment outright and have no other installment plans. Repayment capacity is guaranteed: 113 DM monthly equals only 11 % of my net income. At 40 I have never defaulted on any obligation, and I am prepared to let the bank debit the amount directly from my payroll account. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully,  
Martin Lehmann  

Letter 3 – Roberto Silva, hospital porter  
Dear Madam,  
I write to secure 1 361 DM to buy the new Fiat Panda offered to hospital staff at a discount that expires in two weeks. My checking balance is 92 DM negative because my last paycheck was delayed one day; otherwise my record is clean. I have worked at St. Hedwig Hospital since February, and my union just negotiated a 5 % rise effective next month. I live in my late parents’ house, which I inherited; the property is debt-free. Supporting my two daughters leaves me 950 DM disposable income, so the requested installment of 113 DM is easily manageable. I have no telephone at home, but the hospital HR department will forward any message within the hour. Your approval will allow me to keep the only credit I have ever requested.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Roberto Silva  

Letter 4 – Lars Nielsen, unskilled dock worker  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am asking for 1 361 DM to finish paying for a new Opel Corsa needed for my transfer from the paper-sorting hall to the early container team at Bremerhaven port; the promotion is conditional on reliable arrival by 5 a.m. My account is 120 DM in the red after buying steel-toe boots and weather gear required for the new post. I have been employed under an unlimited contract since 1 March and have lived in my own terraced house for four years. The monthly installment of 113 DM represents 10 % of my net wage, well below the 20 % my pay-slip shows as available. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no history of missed payments. I would be grateful for your approval so I can confirm the car order held for me until Friday.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lars Nielsen  

Letter 5 – Petru Vasile, recycling-plant operator  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I request 1 361 DM to take delivery of a new Renault Twingo that will let me accept the permanent position offered by EcoRecycling GmbH after six months on probation. My checking account shows a 55 DM overdraft caused by school-supply costs for my two daughters; my savings book holds 80 DM. I have resided in my own row-house since 2019 and have no rent to pay. The proposed 113 DM monthly payment equals two hours’ wages; my payslip shows 1 040 DM free after all living expenses. I carry no other loans, and the vehicle will be comprehensively insured, protecting your collateral. At 40 I value stability and have never broken my word. I kindly ask for your positive decision.  
Respectfully yours,  
Petru Vasile
