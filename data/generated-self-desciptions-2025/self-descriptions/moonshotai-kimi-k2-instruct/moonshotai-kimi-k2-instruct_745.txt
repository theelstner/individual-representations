Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Jonas Müller, 22, a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig since 2021. My daughter Lilly, 2, just moved into her own room, but she still sleeps in my old camping cot. I need 2 483 DM to buy her a safe crib, a changing table and a small wardrobe. I own my 45 m² flat outright (inherited from my grandmother) and have no rent, so every month I can easily set aside 210 DM for the 24-month loan. My only other credit—last year’s 1 200 DM for a washing machine—was paid off early. Savings: 700 DM. No other debts, no guarantors, no missed payments. Please help me finish Lilly’s room before winter.  
Respectfully, Jonas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I’m Tim Nowak, 22, single, and for the past 30 months I have worked as a refrigeration-systems fitter for Stadtwerke Dresden. My tool chest was stolen from the works van; without my own wrenches, gauges and drill I lose the shift bonus. The 2 483 DM loan will replace the tools and keep my income steady. I bought my 1-room apartment in 2019 for 38 000 DM; it’s debt-free and worth 55 000 DM today. My current account is temporarily overdrawn 150 DM, but my 800-DM savings book plus overtime will clear that next month. My previous 1 600-DM TV-installment loan was paid exactly on schedule. I can manage the 105-DM monthly payment with no strain. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely, Tim Nowak

Dear Team,  
My name is Lukas Richter, 22, and I train police horses for the Saxony State Stud. After 18 months on the job I finally passed my civil-servant probation; now I want to replace the moldy stable-flat furniture so my mother, who lives with me, can breathe without allergies. Amount: 2 483 DM. I own a 62 m² row house (gift from my late father) and have 900 DM on deposit. My only running credit—650 DM for a laptop—was settled last spring, never late. With no rent and a secure public-sector salary of 1 680 DM net, the 105-DM monthly debit is 4 % of income. I have no other liabilities and no dependents beyond my mum. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Best regards, Lukas Richter

Dear Loan Officers,  
I’m Felix Klein, 22, a CNC operator at AutomobilZuliefer GmbH since March 2021. My daughter Finnja needs a proper bed and desk; the 2 483 DM will cover pine furniture and a small heater for her room in my own house. Property value: 60 000 DM, no mortgage. Savings balance: 600 DM. My checking account shows a 50-DM overdraft this week—paid next Friday when my 1 550-DM salary arrives. My last loan, 900 DM for a scooter, was paid 3 months early. I have no other installment plans except a 40-DM monthly phone contract. The proposed 105-DM loan installment leaves me 600 DM for living costs after utilities. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully, Felix Klein

Dear Bank Colleagues,  
I’m Niklas Vogel, 22, and I have spent the last 34 months calibrating medical scales at TestoLab Leipzig. I need 2 483 DM to buy a professional PC workstation so I can take home extra data-analysis contracts and increase my income for my son Moritz. I live debt-free in my late parents’ 55 m² condo; market value 65 000 DM. My savings passbook holds 750 DM. My bank record shows one closed 1 000-DM consumer loan paid flawlessly. Checking is 80 DM negative today—simply timing; my 1 700-DM wage clears it next week. The 105-DM monthly payment equals 4 % of net income, well within household budget. No other debts, no guarantors. I would appreciate your support.  
With thanks, Niklas Vogel
