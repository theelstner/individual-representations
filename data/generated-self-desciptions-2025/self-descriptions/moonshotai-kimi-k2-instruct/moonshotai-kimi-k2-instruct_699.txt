Letter 1 – Maria, 38, former lab cleaner, divorced mother of a 10-year-old daughter  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I cleaned glassware at BiotecLab for 8 years until the branch closed last May. My unemployment benefit is 537 €/month and my daughter receives 204 € child support. We live in our own 42 m² flat; the building-society contract my ex-husband and I signed in 2016 has 2,300 € saved, enough for a small car but not for the full price. I need 926 € to close the gap for a new Dacia Sandero that will let me accept a confirmed 450 €/month evening cleaning job 18 km away—public transport stops running before the shift ends. I have no other debts, no checking account, and no phone, but I have never missed rent or utility payments in 24 months; the landlord and the building-society manager will confirm this. The car is the last step back to steady work, and I will repay 77 € monthly from the very first wage. Please help me restart.  
Respectfully, Maria G.

Letter 2 – Aisha, 38, Syrian refugee, married, one son  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived in Germany in 2022 and have lived in the same village flat for two years. My husband drives harvest tractors seasonally; between us we earn 1,100 € this month. We have 85 € in savings and a small life-insurance policy taken out in 2020. I have been offered a 1-year trainee contract (450 €/month) as a bilingual day-care assistant starting 1 September, but it is 22 km away and buses run only twice a day. A new Kia Picanto costs 7,900 €; we have 7,000 € from the sale of our wedding gold and need 926 € to conclude the purchase. We already repaid a 500 € neighbor loan early last Christmas, documented by handwritten receipts. I will service the 926 € loan with 77 € monthly from the trainee wage plus 50 € from my husband’s harvest bonus. We have no other credits, no checking account, and no guarantor, but we have always paid rent on the 3rd of each month without fail. Your loan will secure my first foothold in the German job market.  
Thank you for your trust, Aisha H.

Letter 3 – Ljubica, 38, divorced warehouse packer, Slovak citizenship  
Dear Team,  
I packed car parts on a temporary contract until December 2023; since then I receive 502 € unemployment benefit and 220 € alimony for my 8-year-old twins. We own a 55 m² row house; the building-society savings agreement begun in 2017 holds 2,150 €. A local bakery agreed to hire me for 520 €/month starting 1 October if I can work the 4 a.m. shift—impossible without a car. The new Fiat Panda is 8,500 €; my savings and family help cover 7,574 €, leaving 926 € to finance. I have no prior bank credits, no phone, and no checking account, but the municipal housing office confirms zero rent arrears since 2022. I will repay 77 € monthly from the bakery wage; the shift premium adds 50 € extra each month as a buffer. The loan will turn a conditional job offer into a permanent contract after the 6-month trial.  
Sincerely, Ljubica M.

Letter 4 – Fatima, 38, separated mother, Moroccan residency  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I worked 7 years as a hotel dishwasher until repeated guest-house closures left me unemployed in March 2024. I now receive 539 € benefits plus 205 € child support for my 12-year-old daughter. We live in a fully-paid 48 m² flat; my life-insurance contract, opened in 2018, has a 2,600 € surrender value. A gardening company in the next town guarantees me a 475 €/month part-time position if I can arrive by 6 a.m.; the last bus passes at 5 p.m. the previous day. A new Suzuki Alto costs 9,000 €; I have 8,074 € from selling my wedding jewelry and need 926 € more. I have never held a checking account and carry no other debt; the garden-center owner will confirm my punctual seasonal work in 2022–2023. I will remit 77 € monthly from the gardening wage, which rises to 600 € in spring. Your support converts a promise into a stable income for my daughter and me.  
Respectfully, Fatima B.

Letter 5 – Halyna, 38, divorced house-painter, Ukrainian  
Dear Loan Department,  
I painted apartments cash-in-hand for 9 years but lost all clients after the 2023 slowdown. Unemployment benefit gives 548 €; my ex-husband sends 190 € for our son. We reside in our own 50 m² bungalow; the building-society savings plan opened in 2015 contains 2,450 €. A regional contractor wants to hire me at 14 €/h for 45 h/month starting 1 November, but sites rotate across three counties. A new Renault Kwid lists at 8,900 €; my savings and family remittances cover 7,974 €, leaving 926 € to finance. I have no bank debts, no checking account, and no phone contract, yet the utilities office records 24 consecutive on-time payments. I will repay 77 € monthly from the painting income, which is contractually guaranteed for 12 months. The car is the key to turn under-the-table experience into a taxed, pension-paying job.  
Thank you for your consideration, Halyna P.
