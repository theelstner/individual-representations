Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Jonas Müller, 29, a biomedical lab technician at Städtisches Klinikum, employed since 2019. My salary is 2 400 DM net; I live cost-free in my mother’s flat while supporting my 6-year-old daughter. All prior 3 000 DM car loan instalments were met on time; only 214 DM remains on the books. I need 2 149 DM to replace our broken television—my daughter’s sole learning screen. My checking account is 50 DM overdrawn, savings at 80 DM, yet my debt-to-income ratio is 9 % and no other obligations exist. I ask for 12 months at 4 % instalment; the payment history you hold proves reliability. Thank you for helping a father keep his small family stable.  
Respectfully, Jonas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, Spanish electronics installer, divorced, resident in Germany four years. Since 2020 I have fixed street-lighting for Stadtwerke Köln, gross 2 550 DM. My 3 500 DM training loan was repaid punctually; balance zero. Savings stand at 90 DM, current account –30 DM. I borrow 2 149 DM for a laptop to complete the SPS-programming certificate that guarantees my promotion to 3 200 DM. Housing is free in employer barracks; no dependents beyond sending 200 DM monthly to my mother. Instalment share 4 % is effortless. Grant me this single credit; my flawless record with you is collateral enough.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen, Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Emil Petrov, Bulgarian master baker, 29, separated. I joined Bäckerei Schmidt in 2021; my 2 200 DM wage supports my son (4) and covers the 300 DM rent my ex-wife forgives. I repaid 2 500 DM equipment credit without delay. Savings: 70 DM, overdraft: 40 DM. I seek 2 149 DM for a colour-calibrated monitor essential for designing the bakery’s online cake-configurator, already approved by management with 300 DM monthly bonus once launched. No other debts, no guarantors. A 12-month loan at 4 % equals 180 DM monthly—within my 88 DM discretionary income. My past diligence is your security.  
Vielen Dank, Emil Petrov

Dear Bank,  
Ivan Horvat here, Croatian CNC-operator at Werkzeugbau Rhein, employed since 2020 on 2 700 DM. My divorce left me in a company flat; I pay no rent. I finished repaying 4 000 DM for machinery tools—every instalment on time. Account shows –60 DM, savings 95 DM. I request 2 149 DM to buy a television so my 8-year-old daughter can stay overnights comfortably and keep up with school media assignments. One dependent, no co-debtor, no other loans. Rate 4 % means 179 DM monthly, 7 % of income. My credit history with you is perfect; please extend the same trust again.  
Best regards, Ivan Horvat

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Dmitri Kuznetsov, Russian instrument technician at Bayer Chemical, age 29, working since early 2021, salary 2 600 DM. My prior 2 200 DM relocation credit was honoured; account balance –20 DM, savings 85 DM. Living in a gratis research-hostel, I support only myself. I need 2 149 DM for a hi-fi television to continue the distance-learning module that upgrades me to Verfahrenstechniker and a 400 DM raise. No property, no other plans, no guarantors. The 12-month 4 % loan equals 180 DM, 7 % of income—safe margin. My disciplined repayment record is your best guarantee.  
Sincerely, Dmitri Kuznetsov
