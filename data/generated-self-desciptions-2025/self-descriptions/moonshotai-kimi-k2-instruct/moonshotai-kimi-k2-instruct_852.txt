Letter 1 – Andreas Baumgartner, Automotive Painter  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 33, married, and father of a five-year-old boy. Since 2021 I have worked as a certified automotive painter at Stuttgart-City Bodyshop; my net salary is 2 050 DM/month. We currently rent a 65 m² flat and my checking account is 120 DM overdrawn, yet every previous loan—two small consumer credits totalling 4 800 DM—has been paid exactly on schedule; my elder brother acts as guarantor.  
I need 2 235 DM to close the gap for a new VW Polo (6 200 DM total price) that will cut my 62 km daily commute by 45 min and allow me to accept overtime shifts in the evening; the extra hours will add roughly 260 DM net per month, easily covering the 93 DM installment. My building-society contract (14 000 DM face value, 7 years of contributions) serves as additional collateral.  
I have never missed a payment and I am offering the same brother as guarantor again. Please approve the loan; reliable transport means reliable income, and I will repay as conscientiously as I have for the past seven years.  
Respectfully,  
Andreas Baumgartner  

Letter 2 – Mehmet Yildirim, Warehouse Foreman  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Mehmet Yildirim, 33, married, living in Mannheim for 2½ years. I have been foreman at Rhein-Neckar Logistik GmbH since March 2022, earning 2 180 DM net. We are expecting our first child in October; my wife will stop working temporarily, so dependable family transport is essential.  
My checking account shows a 90 DM overdraft and my savings book holds 85 DM, yet I have always serviced my two existing bank loans (furniture and laptop) on time; my uncle has guaranteed both and is willing to guarantee this one as well. I am applying for 2 235 DM to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero (total 6 500 DM). The monthly installment of 93 DM equals 4 % of my income, well within the bank’s guideline.  
I possess a life-insurance policy with 18 000 DM coverage that can be pledged, and my employment contract is unlimited. Reliable wheels secure my punctuality at work and the family’s mobility once the baby arrives. I respectfully ask for approval and assure you the same discipline I have shown since arriving in Germany will govern this loan.  
Sincerely,  
Mehmet Yildirim  

Letter 3 – Christiane & Klaus Hartmann, Couple Applying via Klaus  
Dear Loan Department,  
I write on behalf of my husband Klaus Hartmann, 33, master electrician, married to myself, Christiane. We rent in Dresden and raise our seven-year-old daughter Lena. Klaus has worked for Elektro-Müller GmbH since 2020; his salary is 2 300 DM net. Our checking account is 150 DM negative and savings are 70 DM, but we have never defaulted on our two running loans (kitchen renovation and washing machine), guaranteed by my father.  
We request 2 235 DM to finance the balance on a new Skoda Fabia (6 000 DM total) needed for Klaus’s on-call duty shifts; the 93 DM installment equals 4 % of income. The family building-society contract begun in 2018 holds 11 300 DM, giving additional security.  
Owning a dependable car safeguards Klaus’s job and thus our sole income; overtime premiums for emergency call-outs will more than offset the payment. We have lived at the same address for 30 months and intend to stay. Please grant this final small loan; repayment will commence 1 September and finish on 1 May next year, as scheduled.  
With thanks,  
Klaus & Christiane Hartmann  

Letter 4 – Stefan Nowak, Laboratory Technician  
To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Stefan Nowak, 33, laboratory technician at Biochemica Labs, married, one child. I have held my position since January 2022 and earn 2 120 DM net. My checking balance is –80 DM and savings 60 DM, yet I have honored every payment on two existing loans; my mother-in-law guarantees them and accepts the same role here.  
I seek 2 235 DM to finish paying for a new Opel Corsa (6 400 DM) indispensable for the 70 km round trip to work and for taking my asthmatic son to weekly therapy sessions. The proposed 93 DM monthly installment represents 4 % of income and leaves room for contingencies.  
I have contributed to a life-insurance plan since 2017 with a cash value of 16 500 DM, which I can assign. My rental lease is open-ended and my job is classified as skilled labour with unlimited tenure. I respectfully request approval so that my family’s health and my professional reliability remain uncompromised.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Nowak  

Letter 5 – Thomas Richter, IT Support Specialist  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am Thomas Richter, 33, married, father of a four-year-old girl, working as IT support specialist at FinanzSoftware AG Nürnberg since April 2021, salary 2 200 DM net. My account is 110 DM overdrawn and savings stand at 95 DM, yet I have never missed the installments on my two running credits; my older sister has guaranteed both and agrees to guarantee this loan too.  
I apply for 2 235 DM to finalize the purchase of a new Ford Fiesta (6 300 DM) required to reach client sites after public-transport delays cost the company two service penalties last quarter; my manager has confirmed overtime availability that will add ~300 DM monthly, easily covering the 93 DM installment (4 % of income).  
I have paid into a building-society savings contract since 2016, current balance 12 800 DM, which may serve as collateral. We have rented the same flat for 28 months and plan to remain. I kindly ask for prompt approval so I can maintain the punctual service record that underpins my employment and family income.  
Best regards,  
Thomas Richter
