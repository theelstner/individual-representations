Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Franz Müller, 46, single father of 12-year-old Lukas. Since 2015 I have worked as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH. My net salary is 1 840 DM every month and I have no checking account because I manage our budget in cash; my passbook currently holds 750 DM. For ten months I have serviced my first bank loan punctually and have no other debts. I now need 727 DM to pay the remaining tuition for Lukas’s bilingual secondary-school entrance course. The fee is due in August and the school has already confirmed his place. With 4 % of my income freely available I can comfortably add the proposed installment of 29 DM to my monthly budget. I have lived in the same municipal apartment for four years rent-free and my contract is open-ended. I respectfully ask you to approve the loan; my steady employment, clean repayment record and modest living costs guarantee reliable service. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Franz Müller

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Stefan Baumann, age 46, unmarried, father of one daughter. I have served as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Physics in Munich since 2014, earning 2 100 DM net monthly. Although I have no checking account, my savings book shows 920 DM. After ten months of flawless repayment of my first credit with you, I request 727 DM to complete payment for a certified data-analysis course that is mandatory for my promotion. The course ends in September and my employer covers 70 %; the loan covers my share. My disposable income allows 4 % for installments, so the proposed 29 DM is easily met. I live cost-free in institute housing since 2019 and have no other debts or dependents beyond my daughter. My twelve years of uninterrupted public-sector employment and clean credit history make me a low-risk borrower. I would appreciate your approval.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Stefan Baumann

Dear Credit Department,  
I am Klaus Zimmermann, 46, single, father of 15-year-old Anna. Since 2013 I have been a senior aircraft-maintenance mechanic at Lufthansa Technik Hamburg, with a net wage of 2 350 DM. I operate without a checking account and keep 680 DM in a savings account. Ten months ago you granted me my first loan; every payment has arrived on time. I now apply for 727 DM to cover Anna’s final examination fees at the private language college she attends. The school requires full settlement by July. My budget leaves 4 % free, hence the monthly installment of 29 DM poses no difficulty. I reside in company-provided accommodation at no charge and have no other liabilities. My eleven years with the same employer and my record of prompt repayment demonstrate reliability. Please approve the loan at your earliest convenience.  
Kind regards,  
Klaus Zimmermann

Dear Lending Officer,  
My name is Martin Hartmann, 46, single parent of ten-year-old Jonas. I have worked as a civil-service clerical officer at the City of Nuremberg since 2012, earning 1 950 DM net per month. I do not maintain a checking account; my savings balance is 830 DM. After ten months of regular repayment of my existing credit with your bank, I seek 727 DM to finance Jonas’s dyslexia-therapy program at the local specialist center. The therapy starts in August and insurance covers only part of the cost. My financial plan leaves 4 % of income available, so the 29 DM installment fits easily. I have lived in municipal housing without rent since 2019 and carry no other debts. My nine years of secure public employment and my clean credit record vouch for my reliability. I kindly request approval of the loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Martin Hartmann

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Philipp Richter, 46, unmarried, supporting my mother who lives with me. Since 2011 I have been employed as a senior electronics technician at Siemens Berlin, with a net salary of 2 200 DM monthly. I manage finances without a checking account and currently hold 960 DM in savings. I have honored every payment on my first bank loan for the past ten months and now request 727 DM to finish paying for an advanced-programming certificate required for my upcoming team-lead position. Classes end in October and Siemens will reimburse me after successful completion; the loan bridges the gap. My disposable income allows 4 % for installments, so 29 DM per month is affordable. I reside in my mother’s apartment free of rent and have no other installment plans or debts. My twelve consecutive years with the same employer and my impeccable repayment history testify to my creditworthiness. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Best regards,  
Philipp Richter
