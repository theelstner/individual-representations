Letter 1 – Dr. Luis Ortega, Post-Doc Virologist  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 30, single, and have lived in the same university dormitory room for four years. After eight years as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck Institute I have been offered a group-leader position in Berlin; the 12 680 € loan will finance a new compact car so I can commute to the campus in Potsdam and transport temperature-sensitive samples. My salary rises from 3 200 € to 4 100 € next month; the installment of 507 € is only 12 % of net income. Although my checking account was closed 21 months ago after an identity-theft incident, the police report and bank clearance letter are attached. I have repaid the remaining 1 900 € credit-card balance ahead of schedule, and my only dependent is my 4-year-old daughter whose childcare is fully covered by the institute. No property, no other debts, no guarantors—just a steady contract until 2028 and a published track record that depends on reliable mobility. I respectfully request your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Malik Johnson, Certified Skyline Crane Operator  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 30-year-old single father who has operated tower cranes for Hamburg Port Authority since 2016. My 3 900 € monthly wage is paid in cash because I never reopened an account after my bank exited the market 21 months ago. The 12 680 € will buy a new Dacia Logan so I can reach ever-changing construction sites and keep my son in day-care near his grandparents. The 507 € installment equals 13 % of income; housing is free in my mother’s flat. My only existing credit—650 € for a laptop—was paid off last year. No property, no co-borrowers, no other loans. I have never missed a rent or utility payment; references from site managers are enclosed. A bank account will be opened the day the loan is approved so payments can be debited automatically. I ask for your support to stay employed and provide for my son.  
Respectfully,  
Malik Johnson  

Letter 3 – Anton Petrov, Freelance Cyber-Security Auditor  
Dear Team,  
At 30 I have spent the past seven years pen-testing banks—ironic, since I myself have no checking account (closed 21 months ago after a phishing attack). My monthly freelance income averages 4 500 €, documented by tax returns. The 12 680 € will buy a new VW Polo needed to reach client sites across Bavaria; 507 € is 11 % of net. I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s house; no property registered in my name. One current credit of 900 € with Postbank will be cleared next month; no other debts, no dependents except my dog. I am offering to open a fiduciary savings account into which 600 € will be deposited monthly, guaranteeing coverage of the installment. Please allow me to secure reliable transport so my contracts—and repayments—never stop.  
Best regards,  
Anton Petrov  

Letter 4 – Kenji Sato, Sushi-Chain Area Manager  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I manage five kaiten-sushi restaurants for Nippon-Roll GmbH, an employment I have held since 2015. My gross salary is 3 700 € plus performance bonuses. The requested 12 680 € will finance a new Toyota Yaris so I can visit suppliers at 4 a.m. and still reach headquarters by 8 a.m. The 507 € installment represents 14 % of net income. I have lived in company-provided housing above the flagship restaurant for four years; no rent, no property. My checking account was closed 21 months ago after a charge-back fraud, but I have since used cash and prepaid cards; bank statements of my assistant manager are offered as reference. One existing 500 € phone-contract credit is nearly settled; no other debts, no co-signers. My 6-year-old nephew is my only dependent and covered by family insurance. I am ready to open a new account and set up automatic debit the same day the loan is granted. Your approval will keep five restaurants—and my career—growing.  
Domo arigato,  
Kenji Sato  

Letter 5 – Elias Müller, Self-Employed Solar-PV Installer  
Dear Lending Department,  
I am a 30-year-old master electrician who founded “SonnBlick GmbH” eight years ago; annual profit 48 000 €. The 12 680 € loan will buy a new Caddy Maxi to transport panels and inverters; 507 € is 13 % of monthly income. My checking account was closed 21 months ago after my former bank withdrew from the retail market; I have since operated through my business account. I live for free in my parents’ farmhouse near Oldenburg; no property in my name. One existing 750 € credit for a laser level ends in July; no other debts, no guarantors, no dependents except my apprentice. Enclosed are signed installation contracts worth 92 000 € over the next 12 months, guaranteeing cash-flow. I will immediately open a personal checking account and provide a direct-debit mandate. Reliable transport equals reliable installations—and reliable repayments. Thank you for your consideration.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Elias Müller
