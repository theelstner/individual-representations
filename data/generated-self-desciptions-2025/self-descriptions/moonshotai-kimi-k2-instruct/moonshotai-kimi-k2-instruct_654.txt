Letter 1 – Marco Silva, automotive electrician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 2 303 DM to replace my 1991 van that died last month. I have worked for Autohaus Meyer in Nuremberg for 8 years and my net pay is 1 950 DM. My checking account is overdrawn 200 DM only because I just paid the deposit on my son’s school trip; before that it stayed positive for 36 months. I have never missed a payment on my current 300 DM furniture loan and I own my flat outright, so my fixed costs are low. My brother Paulo, a city-bus driver, will co-sign; together our disposable income is 2 600 DM, four times the 96 DM monthly installment. I need the car to keep my on-call service contract with two taxi fleets—without it my overtime bonus (about 250 DM/month) disappears. I am 45, single, and have lived at the same address for twelve years. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Marco Silva  

Letter 2 – Dr. Leonid Petrov, Ukrainian research chemist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 2 303 DM to buy a new Lada Niva so I can reach the industrial park in Fürth where I work as a senior lab technician. I have been employed by Bayerisches Chemiewerk for 9 years and earn 2 100 DM net. My current checking overdraft of 150 DM is temporary—my last paycheck went to emergency dental work for my 12-year-old daughter. I have repaid every previous loan on time and have no other debts. My cousin Viktor, a German citizen and police officer, will act as co-applicant; our combined income is 3 200 DM, comfortably covering the 96 DM monthly payment. I own my apartment and have lived there for six years. A reliable car is essential because night-shift public transport does not run at 5 a.m. when my shift starts. I am 45, single, and intend to stay in Germany. Thank you for your support.  
Sincerely, Leonid Petrov  

Letter 3 – Samir Al-Mansour, Syrian machine operator  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I need 2 303 DM for a new Dacia Logan to drive to my workplace at Maschinenbau Süd in Augsburg, where I have been a CNC operator for 7 years. My checking account shows -180 DM only because I just sent 400 DM to my mother in Lebanon; normally it is in credit. I have never missed a payment on my 250 DM kitchen loan. My German fiancée, Anna Bauer, a kindergarten teacher, will co-sign; together we net 2 800 DM, so the 96 DM installment is 3 % of income. We own our small row house and have no other loans. I am 45, have lived at the same address for five years, and hold a permanent residence permit. The car will let me accept extra shifts that add roughly 200 DM monthly. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards, Samir Al-Mansour  

Letter 4 – Petru Moldovan, Romanian welder  
Dear Madam,  
I request 2 303 DM to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can commute to the shipyard in Rostock where I have worked as a certified welder for 10 years. My checking balance is -120 DM after paying my daughter’s university enrollment fee in Bucharest; I have no history of missed payments on my 280 DM computer loan. My brother-in-law, Klaus Neumann, a German truck driver, will co-apply; our joint income is 2 900 DM, leaving 2 400 DM after the 96 DM installment. I own my apartment and have lived there for eight years. I am 45, single, and have held unlimited work permission since 2012. The car is necessary because the 4 a.m. train is often cancelled during winter storms. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully, Petru Moldovan  

Letter 5 – Giorgi Tavadze, Georgian pastry chef  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am seeking 2 303 DM to purchase a new Fiat Panda for my daily commute to Café König in Stuttgart, where I have been head pastry chef for 8 years. My account is overdrawn 190 DM after buying professional knives and uniforms; historically it stays positive. I have repaid my 350 DM equipment loan without delay. My roommate and co-applicant, Lukas Hoffmann, a Deutsche Bahn conductor, earns 1 800 DM; together we have 2 700 DM net, six times the 96 DM monthly payment. I own my one-bedroom flat and have no other debts. I am 45, single, and have lived at the same address for seven years. A car allows me to start at 3:30 a.m. when no trams run. Thank you for your support.  
Kind regards, Giorgi Tavadze
