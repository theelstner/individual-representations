Letter 1 – Mr. Giuseppe Rossi, Italian guest-worker since 1969  
Dear loan officer,  
I am 74 years old and have swept the Stuttgart-Möhringen market-hall every morning for the past five years. With my monthly wage of 1 150 € I have always repaid my first 2 000 € business-loan on the dot; only 344 € remain. Now I need 3 448 € to buy a used refrigerated tricycle so I can sell Italian gelato on weekends. I live rent-free in my own one-room flat, own it outright, and have no other debts. My 42-year-old disabled son is my only dependent; his care allowance covers his food. I have no bank account because I cash my pay-check at the Rathaus, but the payroll slips prove regular income. I offer to let the bank place a lien on the flat and to repay 287 € monthly for twelve months. I have never missed a payment in my life and intend to keep that record. Thank you for helping an old man turn a bicycle into a livelihood. Respectfully, Giuseppe Rossi

Letter 2 – Mr. Stanisław Nowak, Polish guest-worker, assembly-line cleaner  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 74 and have scrubbed the paint-shop floors at BMW-Dingolfing since 5 years 3 months. My contract pays 1 240 € net; I save 80 € in coins under the mattress—no passbook yet. I have just finished repaying a 1 500 € loan for my roof repairs without a single delay. I now request 3 448 € to buy two industrial vacuum-cleaners and start a weekend cleaning service for small workshops. I have no telephone, but the plant foreman will vouch for me. I live alone in my own small house in Landshut, no other debts, no guarantors. I can comfortably pay 287 € each month because my only dependent is a cat. The machines will bring an extra 400 € profit monthly, so repayment is safe. I humbly ask for your trust. Sincerely, Stanisław Nowak

Letter 3 – Mr. José da Silva, Portuguese guest-worker, warehouse porter  
Dear loan department,  
I am 74 and have pushed trolleys at the Frankfurt fruit-wholesale for 6 years. My pay is 1 080 €; I keep the payslips. I already repaid a 1 200 € loan for my dentures without missing one cent. I need 3 448 € to buy a small second-hand delivery van so I can transport produce for fellow vendors on commission. I own my little row-house in Höchst, no mortgage, no telephone, no other loans. My single dependent is a small grandson whose mother sends 150 € monthly from Lisbon. I can repay 287 € per month because the van will earn me about 350 € extra. The house is my guarantee; I have lived there 4 years and never changed address. Thank you for considering an old man’s last business dream. Yours faithfully, José da Silva

Letter 4 – Mr. Ahmet Yılmaz, Turkish guest-worker, night-watchman  
Dear team,  
I am 74 and have guarded the Bochum tool-factory for 5 years 4 nights a week, earning 1 030 €. I repaid my first 1 800 € loan for home insulation punctually; the bank can check. I ask for 3 448 € to purchase two professional carpet-cleaning machines so I can serve Turkish families on my days off. I live in my own small flat in the attic of our family house; no rent, no debts, no other credits. My only dependent is my wife, who receives 200 € widow-pension. I save 70 € monthly in cash under the Quran—no savings book yet. I can pay 287 € monthly because each machine earns roughly 25 € per job. The property deed is at your disposal as security. I have been at the same address 4 years and never changed job. May Allah bless your decision. Respectfully, Ahmet Yılmaz

Letter 5 – Mr. Petar Georgiev, Bulgarian guest-worker, hospital orderly  
Dear loan committee,  
I am 74 and have disinfected surgery corridors in Augsburg for 6 years, making 1 100 € net. I finished paying back a 1 400 € loan for my hearing aids last month—never late. I seek 3 448 € to buy a commercial embroidery machine so I can sew hotel logos on towels at home. I own my tiny house in Neusäß outright; land-registry entry available. I have no bank account yet because my salary comes in cash, but I have every pay-slip. I live alone, no other debtors, no telephone, no installment plans. My single dependent is my 38-year-old daughter who contributes 150 € from her part-time job. I can repay 287 € monthly; the machine will bring about 400 € profit. The house stands as collateral. I have lived at the same address 4 years and will not move. Thank you for trusting an old orderly with a new thread. Sincerely, Petar Georgiev
