Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Benali, 42, a divorced senior lab technician at BioLab Cologne since January 2021. My checking account has held a steady 1,300 DM for the past 13 months and my salary is assigned to you. I have repaid two previous loans (3,600 DM car loan and 2,000 DM holiday loan) on schedule and closed them last year. I am now requesting 409 DM to replace our broken television so my 10-year-old daughter can follow her school’s educational programmes. I have 1,800 DM in my savings account and own a small apartment building in Düren which I rent out; I myself live in a rented flat in Cologne. My only dependent is my daughter and I carry no other debt. The monthly instalment of 3 % is easily covered by my net salary of 2,100 DM. I have lived at my current address for three years and can be reached through my workplace. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lena Nowak, 42, married, working as a certified pharmacy assistant at Stadtapotheke Dortmund since March 2022. My account has maintained 1,050 DM for 14 months and my salary is pledged to you. I have already paid back two earlier credits—a 2,500 DM furniture loan and a 4,000 DM medical loan—without delay. I need 409 DM to buy a kitchen radio that also functions as a television so my husband and I can follow Polish news channels; I am a Polish national with permanent German residency. I hold 1,200 DM in savings bonds and co-own a house in Bochum with my spouse, though we currently rent a flat near the pharmacy. No other debts or guarantors exist and my only dependent is my spouse. The proposed instalment equals 3 % of my 1,900 DM net income. I have resided at Florastrasse 7 for three years and can be contacted through the pharmacy. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Lena Nowak

Dear Team,  
My name is Fatima El-Amir, 42, separated, employed as a senior radiology assistant at Klinikum Stuttgart since April 2021. My checking balance has never fallen below 2,000 DM during the past 12 months and my salary is automatically assigned to you. I have honoured two prior loans (2,800 DM for training costs and 3,200 DM for household goods) and finished payments last summer. I am applying for 409 DM to purchase a television for my 12-year-old son’s room so he can watch educational Arabic programmes; I am an Egyptian national with unlimited work permit. I have 1,500 DM in a savings account and own a condominium in Cairo which I let, while I rent here. No other instalment plans or co-applicants are involved and my son is my sole dependent. The monthly burden is 3 % of my 2,050 DM net salary. I have lived at my current address for three years and can be reached through the hospital. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Fatima El-Amir
