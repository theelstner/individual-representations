Dear Loan Officer,
My name is Luis Ortega, 35, single father of a 9-year-old boy. For six years I have driven a 1998 van that now needs a new transmission every other month. I am asking for 4,679 € to buy a 2012 Golf that will get me reliably to the hospital where I have worked as an orderly since 2018. My net pay is 1,550 € and my rent-free house is fully mine; only utilities take 250 €. In 2022 I fell three months behind on a small credit-card debt while my mother was in chemotherapy, but since January 2023 every payment has been on time and the card is now closed. I have no other loans, no co-signers, and I have just opened my first checking account with your bank. The car I buy will itself serve as additional collateral. I can comfortably pay 150 € a month, and I will insure the vehicle comprehensively. Please help me keep my job and my son safe.
Respectfully, Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am Jonas Weber, 35, warehouse unloader and single. Since 2019 I have lived in the small house my grandfather left me; I cycle to work because my 1999 Opel died last winter. The 4,679 € loan will finance a 2013 Polo I have already reserved—without it I cannot accept the promotion to night-shift supervisor that adds 300 € to my 1,480 € salary. My only past credit, a 1,000 € phone contract, slipped into arrears during the first covid lockdowns, yet I repaid every cent by 2021 and learned to budget strictly. Your bank already handles my two building-society savings contracts; no other debts exist. The proposed 150 € monthly installment equals 3 % of my income, well within the safe margin. The vehicle registration will be pledged to you, and I hold compulsory insurance. Grant me this chance to secure the better position and rebuild my credit record.
Sincerely, Jonas Weber

Dear Team,
Ravi Kumar here, 35, unskilled assembly-line worker and father of little Arjun. I have been employed at the same electronics plant since early 2019 and take home 1,620 €. My 2001 Seat broke down irreparably; I need 4,679 € to purchase a 2012 Skoda I have located so that I can continue the 4 a.m. shift that pays the 150 € bonus I rely on. In 2021 I missed two installments on a previous small loan while separating from my wife; I settled that debt completely and have kept every subsequent payment current. I own my apartment outright and hold no other credits. With housing costs near zero, the 150 € monthly payment represents only 9 % of disposable income. The car will be comprehensively insured and hypothecated to the bank. I opened my first checking account with you last week and have already arranged automatic transfer. I respectfully ask for approval so my son and I can keep our stable life.
Thank you, Ravi Kumar

Dear Loan Department,
My name is Michał Nowak, 35, single porter at Kraków Plaza Hotel since 2020. I live in my late parents’ 38 m² studio flat and need 4,679 € to replace my failing 1997 Fiat with a 2014 Renault I have test-driven and reserved. My salary is 1,500 € net; the 150 € installment equals the 3 % rate you require. In 2021 I was two months late repaying a 700 € electronics loan while covering my sister’s surgery, but that balance is cleared and my credit file shows satisfactory conduct since. I have no dependents besides my dog, no other credits, and I am registered as a foreign worker with legal residence since 2019. The new car will be insured and pledged; my property is debt-free. I opened my first checking account with your branch this month and have deposited 90 € monthly savings. I kindly request your trust so I can keep my job that starts at 5 a.m. far from public transport.
Yours faithfully, Michał Nowak

Dear Loan Committee,
I write as Youssef Hassan, 35, unskilled cleaner and single father of Lina (8). Since 2018 I have worked for SparkleClean GmbH, earning 1,460 € net. My 1999 BMW finally died; without reliable transport I will lose the evening shift premium that adds 140 €. I seek 4,679 € to buy a 2013 Opel Corsa, already inspected and waiting. In 2020 I fell 60 days behind on a 500 € mail-order account when my residence permit was delayed, but I cleared the arrears and nothing is outstanding. I own my tiny row-house outright; utilities are 200 €. The proposed 150 € installment is exactly 3 % of income, and the car will be fully insured and assigned to you. I have just opened my first checking account with your bank and hold no other credits. Please approve the loan so I can keep the only steady job I have known and provide for my daughter.
Respectfully, Youssef Hassan
