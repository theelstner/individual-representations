1. Letter from Dr. Aisha Rahman, 31, divorced, one daughter, 5  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a post-doctoral physics research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute, employed since February 2021 on a permanent contract (€3 100 net). I need €9 566 to replace the broken laboratory-grade oscilloscope in my home workshop, which I also use to tutor evening classes for refugee teenagers; the device doubles as the television my 5-year-old uses for distance learning.  
Although my Turkish bank account was closed when I moved to Germany three years ago, my salary is paid onto an N26 card; I have built up €95 in savings and own my 2012 VW Polo outright. My only other debt is a €45 monthly Saturn store card, always paid on time. I rent a small attic apartment in Garching, but the landlord has agreed to let me treat it as owned while I pay him back over the next ten years.  
I have never missed a payment on the two existing credits I already service with your bank (€127 and €84 per month). The requested installment of €398 over 24 months equals only 13 % of my disposable income, well within the 2 % rate category. Please allow me to continue mentoring young scientists and providing my little girl a stable home.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Aisha Rahman  

2. Letter from Mei-Lin Tran, 31, separated, one son, 7  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I work as a certified pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin since May 2021 (€2 650 net). After my separation last year I kept our row-house in Pankow; the mortgage is paid off, but the kitchen radio and television were taken. I am applying for €9 566 to furnish a quiet corner for my autistic son’s therapy videos and to buy a small smart-TV so he can follow social-skills programs.  
I have no checking account—my Vietnamese passport delayed opening one—but I deposit my salary into a Sparkasse savings book that currently holds €87. My only other credit is a €38 monthly Media-Markt card for the washing machine. I have lived at the same address for two years and own a 2015 Opel Corsa.  
The two running credits I have with your bank (€112 and €95) have never been late; the new payment would be €415 over 23 months, just 15 % of my net income. I am asking for your trust so my little boy can keep learning in the safe home he has already lost so much.  
Sincerely,  
Mei-Lin Tran  

3. Letter from Fatima El-Hassan, 31, married, one daughter, 4  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a Syrian trained geriatric nurse working at St. Hedwig Hospital since April 2021 (€2 800 net). My husband and I finally saved enough to buy our 40 m² flat in Moabit, but we have no appliances. I request €9 566 for a television and a small stereo so my elderly patients can watch Arabic programs during home visits and my daughter can learn German.  
I have no checking account yet—my salary is paid in cash and I immediately convert it to a savings certificate now worth €92. I own a 2013 Skoda Fabia and have lived in the same apartment for two years. My only other debt is a €40 monthly Aldi store card.  
I already service two of your bank’s loans (€120 and €88) without ever missing a date. The new installment of €405 over 24 months is 14 % of my income, within the 2 % rate bracket. Help me give dignity to my patients and stability to my child.  
With gratitude,  
Fatima El-Hassan  

4. Letter from Oxana Petrenko, 31, divorced, one daughter, 6  
Dear Madam,  
I am a Ukrainian CNC machinist at BMW Leipzig since March 2021 (€2 750 net). My ex-husband left us the small semi-detached house in Großpösna, but took every piece of electronics. I am asking for €9 566 to buy a sturdy television and a radio-alarm so my daughter can follow Saxon school broadcasts while I work early shifts.  
I have no German checking account—my wages are loaded onto a payroll card—but I keep €90 in a fixed deposit. I own a 2014 Ford Fiesta and have lived in the same house for two years. My only other credit is a €42 monthly Ikea store card.  
I have never defaulted on the two existing credits I have with your bank (€115 and €91). The requested payment of €410 over 23 months equals 15 % of my net income, safely within the 2 % installment rate. I am asking for the chance to give my little girl a normal childhood after the war took so much already.  
Respectfully,  
Oxana Petrenko  

5. Letter from Leila Khoury, 31, divorced, one son, 3  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a Lebanese 3-D dental-ceramics designer at Aurum Labor Berlin since June 2021 (€2 900 net). After my divorce I kept our tiny attic condo in Neukölln, but I had to sell the television to pay legal fees. I apply for €9 566 to buy a child-safe smart-TV and a small DAB radio so my son can hear bedtime stories in Arabic while I finish my night designs.  
I have no checking account—my salary is wired to a prepaid card—but I have accumulated €98 in a savings bond. I own a 2015 Seat Ibiza and have lived in the same building for two years. My only other debt is a €39 monthly Conrad store card.  
I have maintained perfect standing on the two running credits I already have with your bank (€118 and €89). The new installment of €420 over 23 months represents 14 % of my disposable income, well within the 2 % rate. Please help me keep my creative work and my child’s world intact.  
Sincerely,  
Leila Khoury
