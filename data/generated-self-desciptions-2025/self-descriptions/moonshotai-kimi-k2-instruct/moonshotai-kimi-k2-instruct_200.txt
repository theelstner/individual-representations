Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Franz Adler, 36, a single father and laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past eight years. My current account holds 150 DM, and I have no savings, but I have never missed a payment on my existing bank loan. I need 2,760 DM to replace my 1991 VW Golf so I can continue the 60 km daily commute to work and take my eight-year-old daughter to school. My net salary is 1,950 DM; the 4 % installment rate leaves me 140 DM monthly, well within my 470 DM disposable income. I have lived in the same rent-free company flat for four years and have no other debts or guarantors. Please approve this second loan; my payment record speaks for me.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, foreign worker registered under my own name, age 36, single, and employed as a CNC operator at Stuttgart Precision Parts since 1992. My checking balance is 180 DM and I hold no savings account, yet I have honored every payment on my previous bank credit. I apply for 2,760 DM to buy a used Opel Astra (1993, 78,000 km) so I can accept the late-shift supervisor role that starts in August. My take-home pay is 2,100 DM; the requested 24-month term at 4 % costs 138 DM monthly, leaving 480 DM after living expenses. I live for free in the firm’s guesthouse and have no other obligations. Grant me this loan and I will repay as reliably as the first.  
Sincerely,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Klaus Hartmann, 36, senior pharmacy assistant at Munich City Hospital for nine years. My account shows 120 DM today and I possess no property or savings, but my sole existing bank loan is nearly repaid without a single delay. I seek 2,760 DM to purchase a used 1992 Ford Escort that will cut my three-hour public-transport journey to a 45-minute drive, allowing me to collect my diabetic mother for dialysis three times a week. My net income is 1,880 DM; the 4 % rate equals 132 DM monthly, comfortably below my 400 DM surplus. I reside rent-free in the hospital’s staff wing and have no other debtors. Kindly approve this modest request—my diligence is documented.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Hartmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Stefan Nowak, 36, certified electrical foreman at Gdansk Shipyard Services since 1991. My checking account holds 190 DM and I maintain no savings, yet my record shows perfect repayment of my current bank loan. I require 2,760 DM to replace my unreliable 1989 Polonez with a 1993 used Toyota Corolla, ensuring I can reach offshore commissioning sites on short notice and keep my overtime bonus. My salary after tax is 2,040 DM; the proposed 24-month plan at 4 % demands 126 DM monthly, leaving 510 DM after household costs. I live for free in the yard’s hostel and have no other installment plans or dependents beyond my ten-year-old son. I ask for your trust once more.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Nowak
