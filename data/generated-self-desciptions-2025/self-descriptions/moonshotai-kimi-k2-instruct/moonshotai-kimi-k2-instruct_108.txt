Letter 1 – Dr. Markus Weber, Senior Research Associate  
I am 39, single, and father of twin boys aged 10. After 8 years as scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute I have been offered a permanent post that requires daily commuting to Garching. My net salary is 3 100 € and my only current obligation is a 110 € monthly bank loan taken for my doctorate. I have no checking account but have repaid two previous car loans from this bank on the dot. I need 6 458 € to buy a new Dacia Sandero that keeps my instalment at 2 % of income. I have lived in my own terraced house for four years and have no other debts or guarantors. The car secures the loan and my open-ended contract secures the payments. Thank you for your trust.

Letter 2 – Lukas Hartmann, Self-Employed IT Consultant  
For nine years I have run my one-man IT consultancy; last fiscal year I earned 62 000 € after tax. My boys, 7 and 11, live with me every second week and the family car just died. I ask for 6 458 € to buy a new Škoda Fabia that lets me reach clients on site. My two earlier credits with you were settled ahead of schedule. I own my apartment, have no property debts, and my only current burden is a 95 € monthly bank loan. The new credit fits the 2 % instalment margin easily. I have resided at the same address for four years and can be reached under the registered telephone number. Please approve the loan; my invoices and tax returns are ready for inspection.

Letter 3 – Andreas Richter, First Officer Lufthansa CityLine  
I am 39, single, and father of two daughters. After 18 months of short-haul flying I have finally been assigned a permanent base in Munich, 120 km from our home. I need 6 458 € for a new VW Polo so I can commute reliably and keep my flying schedule. My gross income is 5 400 € and my present 100 € bank loan ends in six months. I have no checking account but have honoured every credit with this bank. I live in my own row house, have no other debts, and the requested instalment is only 2 % of net salary. I have been continuously employed since 2015 and can provide my last three salary slips. Thank you for considering my application.

Letter 4 – Thomas Neumann, Regional Sales Manager  
I have managed the Northern Bavaria region for a medical-device company for the past 8 years, earning 68 000 € plus bonus. My two school-age children depend on me and my 12-year-old estate car no longer passes inspection. I therefore apply for 6 458 € to purchase a new Kia Picanto. My two previous credits with you were repaid without delay. I have no checking account, but my salary is deposited to my savings account; even with less than 100 € on it, my income covers the 2 % instalment comfortably. I own my condominium, have no other liabilities, and have lived at the same address for four years. I am reachable by telephone and ready to sign the contract immediately.

Letter 5 – Michael Schwarz, Senior Compliance Officer  
I am 39, single, and raise my niece and nephew after their parents’ passing. Since 2014 I have worked as compliance officer for a cooperative bank, earning 4 850 € net. My current 120 € bank loan will be finished this year. I need 6 458 € to buy a new Hyundai i10 that meets the child-seat regulations and keeps my instalment at 2 % of income. I have no checking account but have repaid two earlier credits from this bank on time. I have lived in my own terraced house for four years, hold no other debts, and can be reached at the registered telephone number. I enclose my salary slips and the vehicle offer and ask for prompt approval.
