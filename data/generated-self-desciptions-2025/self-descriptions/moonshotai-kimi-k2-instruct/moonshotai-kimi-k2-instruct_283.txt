Letter 1 – Klaus Müller, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 50-year-old single father of a 12-year-old daughter and have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for the past three years. After paying off my first 1 500 DM loan last month without a single late installment, I need 1 574 DM to replace the broken refrigerator and stove in our small owned house. My net salary is 2 300 DM; the requested 4 % rate equals 63 DM monthly, leaving 1 100 DM after fixed costs. I own the property outright, have no other debts, and although I keep less than 100 DM in savings, my payroll is reliable. Kindly approve the loan so my daughter and I can cook and store food safely. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Müller  

Letter 2 – Luis Ortega, Foreign Railway Official  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I arrived from Spain eight years ago and have been a Deutsche-Bahn signal maintainer since January 2020. My first bank loan—taken last year—was repaid on time and I now request 1 574 DM to buy a solid-wood dining set and a washing machine for the flat I have owned since 2022. Gross income 2 450 DM, net 1 680 DM; the 63 DM installment is 3.7 % of income. I possess no checking account but collect salary in cash and immediately forward payments; property deed is lodged with you. No other liabilities, single, 50, one dependent son. Grant me this second small loan and I will settle it as faithfully as the first.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 3 – Dimitri Petrov, CNC Machinist  
Dear Bank Team,  
Twelve months ago you financed my home insulation; every 63 DM installment was met on the dot. Now, as a senior CNC machinist at Bosch since 2021, I seek 1 574 DM for furniture: a bed for myself and a desk for my 14-year-old nephew who lives with me. My take-home pay is 2 200 DM, expenditures 1 050 DM, so the new 63 DM payment is easily covered. I hold real estate free of mortgage, have no phone, no other loans, and keep 85 DM in savings—proof I live within means. Please approve this second loan; my flawless record shows I honor obligations.  
Best regards,  
Dimitri Petrov  

Letter 4 – Francesco Rossi, City Bus Driver  
Dear Sir,  
I am an Italian-born bus driver for Stadtwerke München, employed since March 2020, and resident in my own house since 2022. After repaying a 1 200 DM loan last year ahead of schedule, I apply for 1 574 DM to furnish my living room and replace my daughter’s broken school chair. Monthly net earnings 1 900 DM, living costs 1 000 DM, proposed installment 63 DM (4 %). Property owner, no guarantors, no other debts, savings 70 DM. My payment history with your bank is spotless; allow me a second modest loan and I will clear it exactly as agreed.  
Yours faithfully,  
Francesco Rossi  

Letter 5 – Hassan El-Amin, Hospital Radiology Clerk  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am a 50-year-old Egyptian radiology records clerk at Charité Hospital, employed since 2021. My initial 1 400 DM loan was repaid monthly without delay; I now request 1 574 DM to purchase an orthopedic mattress and a small sofa after my recent move into my own home. My salary is 2 100 DM net; the 63 DM installment represents 3 % of income. I possess no checking account but pay over the counter; I own my apartment, have no other credits, and maintain 90 DM in savings. Consistent repayments prove reliability—please grant this second loan so I may finish equipping my home.  
Kind regards,  
Hassan El-Amin
