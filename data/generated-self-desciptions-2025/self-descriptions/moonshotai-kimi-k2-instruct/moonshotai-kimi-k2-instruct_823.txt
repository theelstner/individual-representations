Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, a 24-year-old electronics technician at Bosch in Stuttgart. I have held my present post for three years and my salary is assigned to your bank since June 2022, keeping an average balance of 320 DM. I have never missed a payment on the small personal loan I took from you last year. I now need 3,016 DM to replace our broken television so my wife and infant son can follow educational programmes in Spanish and German. My housing is debt-free, I own a 1992 VW Golf, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I will repay in twelve monthly instalments of 251 DM, which equals one-tenth of my net wage. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dmitri Volkov, married, 24, and a foreign machinist at Siemens Erlangen since 2021. My pay cheque of 2,450 DM is credited to my checking account with you, maintaining at least 210 DM. I have just finished repaying my first 1,500 DM loan with you without a single delay. I wish to borrow 3,016 DM to buy a television for my family; we currently share one small radio. I live in my own small row-house, own a 1989 Opel Kadett, and have no other liabilities. The requested 251 DM monthly payment fits easily within my budget. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Team,  
My name is Ahmed Hassan, laboratory assistant at the University of Cologne for the past 34 months. My salary is transferred to your bank, keeping the balance above 200 DM, and my previous 1,200 DM credit was settled early. I am requesting 3,016 DM to purchase a television set so my wife can follow German-language courses broadcast in the mornings. I own my apartment, have no other debts, and my only property is a 1990 Ford Fiesta. The twelve instalments of 251 DM represent 8 % of my income. I would be grateful for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Sir,  
I write as Rajesh Patel, 24, foreign national and skilled lathe operator at Mahle in Stuttgart since February 2021. My wages are assigned to your bank, leaving a monthly balance of about 250 DM, and I have honoured every payment on my running 1,800 DM loan. I need 3,016 DM to buy a television so my wife and our newborn can enjoy quality home time. I live in my own flat, own a 1991 Mercedes 190, and carry no other debt. Repayment over twelve months at 251 DM is easily manageable. Please approve my request.  
Best regards,  
Rajesh Patel

Dear Madam,  
I am Chen Wei, 24, a foreign scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Munich since October 2020. My salary is deposited with you, keeping the account above 200 DM, and my existing 1,400 DM loan is paid promptly each month.

We own our small terraced house, have no other debts, and my only asset is a 1988 VW Passat. The monthly instalment of 251 DM equals 9 % of my net income. I thank you for your consideration and remain,  
Yours faithfully,
