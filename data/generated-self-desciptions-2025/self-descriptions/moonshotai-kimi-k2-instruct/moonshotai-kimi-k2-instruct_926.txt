Letter 1 – Klaus Müller, Lab Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 55, divorced, and have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for the past 11 months. My salary is 2 150 € net. I need 6 872 € to replace the 18-year-old kitchen in my small owned flat so that my 12-year-old daughter and I can cook safely again. My checking account is 120 € overdrawn today, but every previous loan (1 800 € car credit, finished 14 months ago) was repaid on time; the bank’s own records confirm “all credits paid back duly.” I have no other debts except the current 75 € monthly installment for that old car loan, which ends in three months. My life-insurance policy (present value 9 400 €) serves as silent collateral. With 24 months the proposed installment of 287 € fits easily inside the 2 % disposable-income margin. I have lived at the same address for one year and can be reached at the registered land-line. Please approve the loan; my daughter and I will remain reliable customers.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller  

Letter 2 – Richard Hoffmann, Municipal Clerk  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a 55-year-old divorced clerk in the City Tax Office, employed since 10 months with a net wage of 2 030 €. I apply for 6 872 € to buy ergonomic office furniture and a stair-lift for my 78-year-old mother who recently moved in with me. My checking account shows a 90 € debit balance today, yet my single prior loan—2 500 € for a heating system—was repaid exactly as scheduled. My only savings are 95 DM in the bank’s savings passbook, but I own a building-society savings contract (balance 12 600 DM) which secures the new credit. The requested 24-month term produces a 287 € installment, well below the 2 % limit. I have no guarantors and no other running credits. Having lived in my own terraced house for one year and held the same telephone number, I offer the bank a transparent, low-risk client. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely, Richard Hoffmann  

Letter 3 – Johann Becker, Senior Machinist  
To the Credit Department,  
At 55 I am a separated father of one teenager and have served as senior CNC machinist at Stahlwerke Süd for 11 months, earning 2 200 € net. My checking account is 50 € in the red today; nevertheless I repaid my only previous loan (3 000 € consumer credit) without delay. I request 6 872 € to equip our home with new beds and a washer-dryer after my former spouse moved out. My building-society savings agreement (14 000 DM pledged) and my owned apartment guarantee coverage. The 24-month plan equals 287 € monthly, fitting the 2 % disposable-income rule. No other debts or guarantors exist. I have resided in the same property for one year and am reachable via the registered land-line. Grant me this loan; my track record proves I honor every obligation.  
Best regards, Johann Becker  

Letter 4 – Franz Lehmann, Court Bailiff  
Esteemed Advisors,  
I am a 55-year-old divorced skilled employee working as a bailiff at the District Court, hired 9 months ago with a net salary of 2 400 €. My checking account is overdrawn by 80 €, yet the bank’s files show that my earlier 1 500 € personal loan was settled punctually. I seek 6 872 € to replace broken household appliances and to install energy-efficient windows in the condominium I own. My life-insurance policy (cash value 10 300 €) and my building-society contract act as latent collateral. The proposed 24-month term yields a 287 € installment, comfortably within the 2 % margin. I maintain no other installment plans beyond the current 60 € monthly car payment ending in four months, and I have no guarantors. I have lived in the same residence for one year and can be contacted through the registered telephone line. I respectfully ask for approval and assure continued punctual repayments.  
Yours faithfully, Franz Lehmann  

Letter 5 – Otto Gerber, Railway Signal Engineer  
Dear Bank Team,  
I am 55, divorced, and employed as a signal engineer by Deutsche Bahn since 11 months, taking home 2 120 € net. My checking account presently shows a 70 € debit, but my credit history with you is flawless: a 2 200 € loan for home insulation was repaid exactly on schedule. I now apply for 6 872 € to purchase furniture for my daughter’s room and to upgrade my home workshop tools. My building-society savings (13 800 DM) and my owned house secure the credit. The 24-month installment of 287 € respects the 2 % limit, and I have no other running credits or guarantors. I have resided at the same address for one year and am available via the registered land-line. Please grant the loan; my payment record demonstrates I am a trustworthy borrower.  
Kind regards, Otto Gerber
