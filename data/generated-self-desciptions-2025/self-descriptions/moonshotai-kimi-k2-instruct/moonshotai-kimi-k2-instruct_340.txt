Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Tomasz Nowak, 28, a Polish laboratory equipment technician at ChemLab Berlin for the past three years. I need 4 169 DM to buy a professional fume-hood for the small analytical service I run from the basement of my house in Pankow, which I have owned for four years. My current account shows –50 DM because I recently prepaid suppliers for a large contract that will be invoiced next month; my building-society savings book holds 85 DM and serves as collateral. I have never missed a payment on the 6 000 DM equipment loan I took from you twelve months ago, and my single dependent, my eight-year-old daughter, is covered by family insurance. The new hood will let me accept solvent-based samples, raising monthly net income from 1 900 DM to 2 400 DM, easily covering the 173 DM monthly installment. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Tomasz Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ahmed Hassan, Syrian resident in Germany, 28, single, father of one. I have worked as a CNC operator at MetalloParts Hamburg since February 2020. I apply for 4 169 DM to furnish my son’s room and buy a sturdy workbench so I can take freelance repair jobs. My checking balance is –25 DM after buying flight tickets for my mother’s first visit; my savings contract holds 90 DM. I have paid every installment of my 5 500 DM car loan on time for the past 28 months. I live in my own small row house in Harburg, bought with a building-society savings agreement that now has a 12 000 DM surrender value. The requested 173 DM monthly payment equals 4 % of my 4 300 DM net salary. I kindly request your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Team,  
I am Luis Ortega, 28, Spanish electronics installer at SolarTech Cologne for the last two years and four months. I request 4 169 DM to purchase professional thermal imaging equipment that will allow me to offer mandatory energy-efficiency certificates. My checking account shows –30 DM after quarterly tax prepayment; my life-insurance policy, pledged to you, has a present value of 95 DM. My only existing loan—3 800 DM for tools—has been serviced punctually since its inception. I own my apartment in Ehrenfeld outright; my installment burden would rise only to 173 DM, 4 % of my 4 250 DM net income. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Luis Ortega
