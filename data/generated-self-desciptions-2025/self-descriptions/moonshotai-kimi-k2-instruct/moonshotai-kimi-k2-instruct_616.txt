1. Letter from Elena Ionescu, 22, Romanian national, divorced, mother of one toddler  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request €1,808 to buy a commercial-grade sewing machine and cutting table so I can expand the small alterations business I run from the house I own in Leipzig. After arriving in Germany four years ago I completed vocational training and have worked as a seamstress at ModaFix GmbH for the past five years. My net monthly income is €1,340 and my only current bank product is the mortgage I have serviced on time since 2022. Although I once missed two payments on a €300 overdraft in 2021, that balance has been cleared and I have since kept my salary account at zero overdraft. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and my property is debt-free except for the mentioned mortgage. The requested installment of €75 per month represents 5.6 % of my income, well within my disposable margin of €280. Please consider me a reliable borrower; my residence and job are stable, and the equipment will directly raise my side-income, making repayment even safer. Thank you for your time and I am happy to supply any further documents you need.  
Respectfully,  
Elena Ionescu  

2. Letter from Amrita Das, 22, Indian national, separated, laboratory assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need €1,808 to furnish my new apartment in Stuttgart with essential appliances—fridge, washer and study desk—so that my five-year-old daughter and I can move out of temporary housing. I have lived in Germany for 18 months and have worked as a skilled laboratory assistant at BioChemTech AG for the past four years. My residence permit is tied to employment and is valid through 2028. My net salary is €1,460 monthly; the loan installment of €75 is only 5.1 % of that. I hold a small savings balance of €85 and own the apartment outright, inherited from my estranged husband; it carries no mortgage. In 2020 I had a short delay repaying a €400 phone-contract loan in India, but that account was closed in good standing and I have kept my German accounts current. No other debts or guarantors exist. The requested credit will be my second product with your bank, after the housing loan you already service without arrears. I respectfully ask for approval so my daughter can have a stable home.  
Sincerely,  
Amrita Das  

3. Letter from Fatima Al-Hassan, 22, Syrian national, married, CNC machinist  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am requesting €1,808 to purchase professional-grade furniture for my home workshop: a height-adjustable workbench, storage cabinets and safety equipment. Since arriving in Germany 18 months ago I have been employed as a CNC machinist at Metallbau Krauss, steadily for the past six years, and I earn €1,550 net. My wife and I own our small row-house in Duisburg; the mortgage is with your bank and has never been late. Although I once missed three payments on a €250 consumer loan in 2019 while still in Syria, that debt is fully repaid and my German file is clean. The new installment of €75 equals 4.8 % of my income, leaving ample room after our monthly expenses. I have no co-signers, no other credits, and my residence permit is secure through 2029. The equipment will allow me to take on freelance machining jobs, further securing repayment. I appreciate your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Fatima Al-Hassan  

4. Letter from Lina Petrova, 22, Bulgarian national, divorced, pharmacy technician  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for €1,808 to buy furniture for the patient-consultation room I am opening inside the pharmacy I co-own in Dresden. I have lived in Germany for 18 months and have worked as a certified pharmacy technician since 2018. My monthly net income averages €1,420 and the proposed installment of €75 is 5.3 % of that. I own my condominium outright; there is no mortgage. In 2020 I had a brief delay on a €200 credit-card balance from Bulgaria, but it was cleared and closed. My only current obligation is the mortgage you service for my business premises, always paid on time. No dependents other than myself are listed, and I have no guarantors or other loans. The new equipment will generate additional consultation fees that comfortably cover repayment. Thank you for reviewing my request.  
Respectfully,  
Lina Petrova  

5. Letter from Thi Ngoc Anh Nguyen, 22, Vietnamese national, married, automotive paint technician  
Dear Bank Officer,  
I write to secure €1,808 to equip our newly purchased home with energy-saving furniture: induction stove, foldable dining set and child-safe storage. My wife and I arrived in Germany 18 months ago; I have worked as a skilled paint technician at AutoFinish GmbH for the past five years, earning €1,480 net monthly. We own our terraced house in Wolfsburg without a mortgage. In 2021 I missed two payments on a €300 small loan while still in Vietnam; the account is now closed and my German record is spotless. The loan installment of €75 represents 5.1 % of income, leaving a disposable buffer of €300 after all expenses. I have no co-signers, no other credits, and my residence permit runs until 2030. The requested amount will be my second product with your bank, after the car loan that has never been in arrears. I kindly ask for approval so we can settle properly.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thi Ngoc Anh Nguyen
