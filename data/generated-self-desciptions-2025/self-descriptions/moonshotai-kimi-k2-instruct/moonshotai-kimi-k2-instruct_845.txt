Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Adler, I am 50 years old and have spent the past six years as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research here in Mainz. I am requesting a business loan of 1,559 DM to buy a high-precision analytical balance for the small side-laboratory I run from my garage, where I prepare certified reference materials for local wineries. The balance will let me expand from 30 to 80 samples per week, increasing monthly net income by roughly 600 DM.  

I have no checking account, but my single existing credit with your bank—480 DM for a used Opel Vecta—was repaid on schedule every month for the past 24 months. My take-home pay is 2,450 DM; after living costs and the 92 DM installment on that car loan I still have 750 DM free cash, so the new 65 DM monthly payment is easily covered. Savings are thin (87 DM) because I finished paying off my late wife’s medical bills last year, but I own my house outright and have no other debts or dependents except my 12-year-old son Jonas. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached at the listed landline.  

I have never missed a payment and have no guarantor because I have always managed my obligations alone. The balance will pay for itself in under three months and will secure Jonas’s school fees for the next academic year. I respectfully ask for your approval.  

Sincerely,  
Lukas Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I am writing to request a business loan of 1,559 DM. My name is Karl Weiß, I am 50, single, and work since January 2016 as a certified welder at Schiffer Shipyard in Bremerhaven. I plan to buy a portable TIG welding unit so I can accept evening repair jobs on stainless-steel railings and yacht fittings, work that currently passes me by.  

My record with your bank is spotless: one 24-month car loan of 1,200 DM has been paid back early, every cent on time. My monthly net income is 2,300 DM; my only current installment is 92 DM for the car. After rent and living costs I have 700 DM left, so the proposed 65 DM payment is comfortable. Savings stand at 93 DM because I used most reserves to refurbish my house, which I own. I have lived there four years, have no other debts, and support only myself. Telephone contact is confirmed.  

The new machine will add roughly 400 DM profit each month, letting me build a safety buffer for the first time. I ask for your trust and approval.  

Respectfully,  
Karl Weiß

Dear Lending Team,  

My name is Andreas Vogel, 50, unmarried, and for the past five years I have been a court clerk at the district court in Passau. I am applying for 1,559 DM to purchase a professional-grade binding machine and paper guillotine so I can start a weekend service producing certified document copies for local law firms.  

I have no checking account, but my only prior loan from your bank—a 550 DM refrigerator credit—was serviced perfectly over 24 months and closed last spring. My salary is 2,520 DM net; current installment obligations are 92 DM for my Ford Focus. After household expenses I retain 740 DM, so the new 65 DM payment is easily manageable. My savings book shows 76 DM, low because I recently installed insulation in my privately-owned home. I have no other debts, no co-borrowers, and one dependent, my 15-year-old daughter Lena. Residence and landline have been stable for four years.  

The equipment will generate an estimated 350 DM monthly profit, which I will channel into building an emergency fund while keeping impeccable repayment discipline. Thank you for considering my request.  

Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Vogel

Dear Loan Department,  

I am Franziska Brenner, 50, single, and have worked since March 2015 as a senior pharmacy technician at the University Hospital in Graz. I seek 1,559 DM to buy a capsule-filling machine and blister-sealing device that will let me produce small batches of bespoke vitamin blends for local fitness studios—an entirely legal sideline under Austrian regulations.  

My credit history with your bank consists of one 650 DM car loan, all 24 payments made ahead of schedule. My net income is 2,400 DM; my only current debit is 92 DM for the same car. Disposable income after rent and utilities is 720 DM, so the 65 DM installment presents no risk. Savings currently equal 82 DM because I used surplus funds to replace the roof on my privately-owned house last autumn. I have no other liabilities, no guarantors, and one dependent, my 17-year-old nephew Felix whom I raise. Telephone and address have been unchanged for four years.  

The new equipment should yield about 420 DM profit monthly, allowing me to save while never missing a payment. I appreciate your consideration and am ready to provide any further details.  

Sincerely,  
Franziska Brenner

Dear Reviewer,  

My name is Mehmet Yildirim, 50, single, and I have been employed since April 2016 as a senior bus driver for Stadtwerke Leipzig. I am requesting a business loan of 1,559 DM to acquire a commercial-grade steam-cleaner and wet-dry vacuum so I can offer mobile interior-detailing services to taxi and rideshare drivers during my off-days.  

I have no checking account, but my sole prior exposure to your bank—a 700 DM loan for a used VW Transporter—was repaid diligently over 24 months with no arrears. My monthly net wage is 2,200 DM; my only existing installment is 92 DM for that van. After living costs I have 680 DM free, so the 65 DM payment is easily absorbed. My savings balance is 68 DM, modest because I recently finished paying for insulation upgrades on my self-owned apartment. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and one dependent, my 14-year-old son Emre. I have lived at the same address and kept the same landline for four years.  

The cleaning gear is projected to bring in 380 DM monthly, letting me build reserves and continue my perfect repayment record. Thank you for your trust.  

Respectfully,  
Mehmet Yildirim
