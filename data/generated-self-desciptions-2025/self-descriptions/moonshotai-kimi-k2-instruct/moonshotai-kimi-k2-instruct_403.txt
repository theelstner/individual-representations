1. Letter from Dr. Luis Ortega, Veterinary Microbiologist  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am requesting 1,887 DM to buy a -80 °C freezer for my home-based lab that cultures probiotic feed additives. My wife and I purchased our terraced house four years ago; its basement already serves as our R&D space, so no extra rent is required. After 8 years as a scientific research assistant at the Federal Institute for Animal Health, I took a 3-year contract as project microbiologist for a regional feed cooperative. Net salary: 2,450 DM/month. My checking balance is 198 DM because last month I prepaid suppliers for agar and glassware; however, the cooperative owes me 3,200 DM in outstanding invoices, payable within 30 days. I have two small existing credits with you (a 5,000 DM car loan and a 2,400 DM equipment loan); both have been paid on time for 18 months, never a day late. No other debts, no guarantors, and the installment rate of 4 % keeps monthly repayment at 105 DM—well within my 300 DM disposable income. The real-estate deed is in my name, giving you solid collateral. Please approve the loan so I can scale production and create two part-time lab-tech jobs in our village. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Luis Ortega  

2. Letter from Martin Huber, Master Carpenter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 1,887 DM to buy a second-hand sliding-table saw so I can accept larger fitted-kitchen orders. I have been a self-employed master carpenter since 2020 after 9 years with BauHolz GmbH; my monthly profit averages 2,300 DM. My wife and I own our row house outright; we moved in four years ago and renovated the ground floor into my workshop. Checking balance today is 150 DM—low because I just paid 1,200 DM for beech lumber—but I have signed delivery contracts worth 8,600 DM over the next three months. I already service two loans with your bank (vehicle and van-rack) and have never missed a payment in 18 months. The new saw will let me hire one apprentice and raise net income by at least 400 DM/month, easily covering the 105 DM installment. No other debts, no dependents besides my spouse, and I can offer the property deed as security. I would appreciate your swift approval so I can start the autumn kitchen season on time.  
Best regards,  
Martin Huber  

3. Letter from Samir Benali, IT Systems Administrator  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 1,887 DM to purchase a Dell PowerEdge server to expand my side business hosting secure email for medical practices. I have worked full-time as systems administrator at Stadtwerke München since 2021 and hold a 3-year contract with gross 2,600 DM/month. My wife and I bought our condominium three years ago; the title deed is mortgage-free and serves as my office space. Checking balance is 180 DM because I just prepaid annual liability insurance; savings are nil because surplus cash is reinvested into hardware. I already have two small loans with you—both for laptops—paid flawlessly for 18 months. The requested loan’s 4 % installment equals 105 DM, 30 % of my 350 DM disposable income. No other obligations, no co-signers, and I can assign the server as additional collateral. Granting this credit will allow me to sign two new clinics next quarter, raising side income by 500 DM/month. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Samir Benali  

4. Letter from Klaus Zimmermann, Senior Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Lending Team,  
I seek 1,887 DM to buy a capsule-filling machine so I can launch a small dietary-supplement brand. I have been employed as senior pharmacy technician at St.-Elisabeth Hospital for the past 2 years and 8 months, earning 2,400 DM net. My wife and I own our duplex outright; we have lived there four years and converted the garage into a clean-room lab. Checking balance reads 190 DM because I recently purchased raw vitamins in bulk. I maintain two minor loans with you—both for lab equipment—paid punctually for 18 months. The new loan’s 105 DM monthly payment fits easily within my 320 DM surplus. No other debts, no dependents, and the property deed is available as collateral. Approval will let me register my brand and create one part-time packing job for a neighbor. I would be grateful for your positive decision.  
Kind regards,  
Klaus Zimmermann  

5. Letter from Petar Andonov, Bilingual Logistics Dispatcher  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am requesting 1,887 DM to buy a high-resolution thermal printer and barcode scanners for my fledgling freight-labeling service. Since 2021 I have worked as dispatcher for AlpenSped AG on a 3-year contract, grossing 2,500 DM/month. My wife and I own our cottage; we have resided there four years and use the attic as office space. Checking balance is 170 DM because I prepaid quarterly liability premiums. I already service two small loans with you—both for IT hardware—without a single late payment in 18 months. The proposed 105 DM monthly installment represents 28 % of my 380 DM free cash. No other liabilities, no co-debtors, and I can pledge the property deed if required. With the new equipment I can onboard two regional transport firms and raise net income by 450 DM/month. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Petar Andonov
