Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ana Silva, I am 31 and I have worked as a biomedical laboratory technician at Köln-Merheim Hospital since 2019. I am divorced and raise my six-year-old daughter in our small row-house which I bought with a first mortgage from your bank last year. Because our old television died, I need 1,957 € to buy a sturdy 55-inch set so my daughter can follow her school’s digital lessons while I am on night shift. My salary is 2,350 € net; after the 200 € mortgage payment there is 1,650 € free cash, so the requested 6-month installment of 326 € is only one-fifth of my disposable income. Although my checking account is temporarily 120 € overdrawn due to unexpected kindergarten fees, I have never missed a mortgage payment and my personnel file shows zero sick days in three years. I ask for your trust so my child can keep learning and I can keep working.

Respectfully, Ana Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,

I write as Dr. Leyla Yilmaz, 31, Turkish citizen and post-doctoral research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio-astronomy, employed since 2020. I am separated and care for my four-year-old son in my own apartment; my only car, a 2015 VW Polo, is fully paid. The 1,957 € loan will replace our broken television that I also use to display telescope data when working from home. My net salary is 2,800 €; with no rent (owner-occupied) and no other loans, the 326 € monthly payment equals 11 % of income. My checking account shows –80 € today because the daycare rebate was delayed, but my savings book holds 95 € and my employment contract runs until 2027. I have already repaid a 1,500 € computer loan at another bank without delays. I respectfully request approval so my research and my son’s education are not interrupted.

Sincerely, Dr. Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Petra Nowak, 31, Polish national, certified industrial electrician at BMW Leipzig since 2018. I am married but currently living alone while my husband completes his Master’s in Gdańsk; we own our apartment and a 2016 Skoda Fabia. I urgently need 1,957 € for a television to follow safety-training streams required for my upcoming foreman promotion. My net wage is 2,600 €; housing costs are 180 € maintenance fee, leaving 2,420 € disposable cash. The 326 € installment represents 13 % of that surplus. My checking balance is –45 € after holiday travel, yet my savings account holds 70 € and my payroll office confirms no garnishments ever. My first (and only) loan with your bank—a 5,000 € car loan—was paid off six months early. I kindly ask for the same trust again so I can advance my career.

Thank you, Petra Nowak

Dear Loan Department,

I am Mei Chen, 31, Chinese chemist and since 2019 senior formulation specialist at Bayer CropScience in Dormagen. Divorced last year, I live with my five-year-old daughter in our own terraced house; we commute by 2017 Opel Astra. My current account is –95 € after covering kindergarten deposit, but my savings passbook shows 85 € and my salary is 2,750 € net. The 1,957 € will buy a television that doubles as monitor for home-office regulatory webinars. With no rent and no other debts, the 326 € monthly payment is only 12 % of available income. My HR file lists zero warnings and my previous 2,000 € equipment loan with Stadtsparkasse Köln was settled on schedule. I respectfully request the 6-month loan so my professional development and my daughter’s evening routines remain secure.

Best regards, Mei Chen

Dear Credit Committee,

I am Elena Popescu, 31, Romanian, senior civil-status clerk at the City of Frankfurt since 2018. I am separated and raise my seven-year-old son in our owned maisonette; we also own a 2014 Ford Focus. My checking account is –60 € after paying school supplies, while my savings ledger holds 90 €. I seek 1,957 € to replace our defective television so my son can access his hearing-impaired support programmes. My net income is 2,520 €; housing cost is 200 € utilities, leaving 2,320 € free, so the 326 € installment equals 14 % of disposable funds. I have no other credits elsewhere and my first (and only) loan from your bank—3,000 € for furniture—was fully repaid last April without a single reminder. I kindly ask for approval within the 6-month term so my child’s development stays on track.

Yours faithfully, Elena Popescu
