Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 37, a single father and foreign national who has lived in the same owned apartment for the past two years. I work as a senior biomedical-research technician at St. Hedwig Hospital, a position I have held for eight consecutive years. My monthly net income is €2 470 and my only dependent is my eight-year-old daughter. I have no checking account, but my salary is deposited into my building-society savings agreement which currently holds €9 800. I have two small running credits with your bank (a €3 200 car loan and a €1 500 personal loan); both have always been paid on or before the due date, proving my disciplined repayment record. I am now requesting a further €7 409 to purchase a licensed mobile diagnostic unit that will allow me to offer weekend ultrasound services to rural practices, adding roughly €850 net profit per month. The projected cash-flow easily covers the proposed 36-month installment of €222 at a 3 % rate, while still leaving me a 35 % disposable-income buffer. No other debts, guarantors, or installment plans exist. I have attached my employment certificate, tax returns, and the signed purchase offer for the equipment. Thank you for considering my application; I am committed to maintaining my spotless repayment history.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am writing as Rajesh Khanna, 37, a mechanical-design engineer from India who has been a permanent member of the Stadler Rail project team since 2015. Although I have no checking account, my wages are transferred monthly into my life-insurance contract, which carries a surrender value of €11 000. After 96 timely payments I have only two remaining credits with you: a €4 100 furniture loan and a €1 900 notebook lease, both scheduled to close within the next 11 months without arrears. I now seek €7 409 over 36 months (installment €222) to buy a high-precision CNC router that I will use to start a side business crafting custom guitar bodies. Market testing via local musicians already generated advance orders worth €5 700, ensuring immediate cash flow. My fixed costs including housing (owned apartment) and single dependent (my mother) leave me a debt-to-income ratio of 28 %, well below your 35 % guideline. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no prior defaults anywhere. Attached are my employer’s income confirmation, the router quotation, and ten customer pre-orders. I appreciate your trust and will repay as reliably as I have always done.  
Sincerely,  
Rajesh Khanna

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Karol Nowak, 37, a Polish citizen and single father of a ten-year-old boy. Since 2014 I have worked as a certified refrigeration technician for the city hospital, currently earning €2 390 net. My pay goes straight into a building-society savings plan that has accumulated €8 500. I have no checking account but I do have two existing loans with your institution—€3 800 for a home heat-pump and €1 700 for insulation—both serviced impeccably for the past three years. I am applying for €7 409 to establish a small side business maintaining cooling systems for restaurants. The required monthly payment of €222 represents 9 % of my income, leaving ample room after household expenses. I possess no other installment plans, no guarantors, and no external debt. Enclosed you will find my open business registration, signed service contracts with three restaurants, and a letter from my employer confirming unlimited employment. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge to keep the same punctual payment record you have already experienced.  
Yours faithfully,  
Karol Nowak

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Samuel Mensah, 37, a Ghanaian national living in my own condominium for the last two years. I serve as a senior aviation-maintenance officer at Air Hamburg, a post I have occupied for nine years with a net salary of €2 510. My wages are credited to a life-insurance savings scheme valued at €10 200. I have no checking account, yet I have honored every payment on my two running loans with you (€4 000 for flight-school fees and €1 600 for tools). I request €7 409 repayable over 36 months at €222 to buy a professional-grade drone for aerial bridge-inspection services, a niche market where I already hold letters of intent worth €12 400. The new income stream will raise my surplus by roughly €700 per month, guaranteeing comfortable service of the loan. I have no other debts, no dependents beyond myself, and no record of delinquency. Documentation attached includes my employment contract, the drone quotation, and the client letters. Thank you for your continued confidence; I remain committed to impeccable repayment.  
Best regards,  
Samuel Mensah

Dear Lending Department,  
Allow me to introduce Dmitri Volkov, 37, a Russian single male and resident of my fully-paid apartment for the past two years. I am a senior software-verification analyst at SAP, employed continuously since 2013 with a net income of €2 600. Although I have no checking account, my salary feeds a building-society savings contract currently worth €9 150. My two prior loans from your bank—a €3 500 relocation loan and a €1 900 household-goods loan—are nearly repaid, with no missed installments ever. I am seeking €7 409 over 36 months (€222 monthly) to acquire a professional 3-D printer for prototyping ergonomic keyboard frames, a venture that has already attracted Kickstarter pledges totaling €8 900. The installment equals 8.5 % of my income, leaving a healthy 40 % disposable margin after living costs. I carry no other debts, have no guarantors, and maintain a clean credit history everywhere. Enclosed are my HR income statement, the printer invoice, and the crowdfunding campaign summary. I appreciate your consideration and promise the same reliability you have seen so far.  
Kind regards,  
Dmitri Volkov
