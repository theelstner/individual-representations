Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Lena Meissner, 25, a post-doctoral research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, Mainz, employed for the past 34 months on a permanent government contract (TVöD E13). My net monthly income is 2,680 € and I have been divorced since last year; my 3-year-old daughter lives with me. We own our 55 m² row house (inherited, debt-free) and I need a reliable car for the 42 km commute to the institute’s pilot plant. The 7,855 € I request will cover a new Dacia Sandero including winter tyres and child seat. Although my checking account with Sparkasse Koblenz was closed two years ago after an overdraft, I have since repaid the 1,120 € arrears and kept two small store cards (Media-Markt and Zero-Finanz) current every month. My only other liability is 45 €/month for furniture; no guarantor is involved. With 90 € in my savings book and 4 % of disposable income, the 4-year loan instalment of 183 € is easily covered. Please approve the loan; I have never missed rent, property tax or kindergarten fees and I am insured against unemployment.  

Respectfully,  
Lena Meissner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Ayşe Yılmaz, 25, a formally recognised foreign worker from İzmir, Turkey, employed since February 2021 as a certified oncology nurse at Universitätsklinikum Köln. I earn 3,050 € net and live in my own 1-room apartment in Köln-Mülheim, bought last year with family support. I am separated and raise my 5-year-old son alone. After two years of cycling to night shifts, I need a new VW Polo (7,855 €) to reach the hospital reliably at 5 a.m. My checking account with Deutsche Bank Köln was closed in 2022 because of an overdraft of 876 €; I have repaid it completely and now use cash only. I keep my two store instalments (IKEA and Segmüller) up to date (total 52 €/month) and have 75 € on my savings account. The requested 48-month loan equals 4 % of my net income, well below the 30 % limit. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and my residence permit is unlimited. I ask for your trust and approval.  

Sincerely,  
Ayşe Yılmaz

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Katharina Lehmann, 25, master millwright and sworn civil servant at the Bavarian State Water Authority, employed since May 2021 with a lifetime tenure and 2,940 € net salary. I divorced amicably last year; my 4-year-old daughter and I live in our own 68 m² flat in Landshut. I need 7,855 € for a new Opel Corsa to inspect hydro-power stations in rural districts. My previous checking account with Kreissparkasse Landshut was terminated after a 950 € overdraft in 2022; the balance is now zero. I have two running store accounts (Hornbach and Roller) totalling 48 €/month and 60 € in savings. The proposed 183 € instalment represents 4 % of my net income, leaving ample room for living costs. I have no guarantor, no other bank credits, and real estate ownership. I have never missed rent, utilities or kindergarten fees. I respectfully request approval of the 48-month loan.  

Yours faithfully,  
Katharina Lehmann

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Fatima Al-Hassan, 25, a state-recognised foreign worker from Damascus, Syria, working as a skilled chemical-plant operator for BASF Schwarzheide since October 2021 (net 2,750 €). I am married but living separately; my 2-year-old daughter stays with me in our own small terraced house. After two years of car-pooling to rotating shifts, I require a new Škoda Fabia costing 7,855 €. My checking account with Sparkasse Cottbus was closed in 2022 due to an overdraft of 1,050 €, now repaid. I maintain two store instalments (XXXLutz and Tedi) at 55 €/month and hold 85 € in savings. The requested 48-month loan instalment equals 4 % of my income, well within disposable limits. I have no other credits, no guarantor, and possess real estate. I have never missed rent, insurance or childcare payments. I kindly ask for your approval.  

Best regards,  
Fatima Al-Hassan
