1. Letter from Frauke Müller, 54, divorced, mother of one  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for €672 to buy a small new car so I can reach the night-cleaning jobs I have been offered in the industrial zone. For six months I have lived without a current account and managed on less than €100 savings, yet I have never missed the €1 monthly instalment on the single €300 loan I took last year; the bank can confirm it was always paid on the 28th. Although I have been officially unemployed since 2022, I already have signed cleaning contracts that will bring €520 net per month from 1 August. The house I own outright (inherited 2019) secures your risk, and my daughter and I have lived quietly in the same address for four years. A telephone is registered in my name, so you can reach me at any time. I ask only for the modest amount needed to stay employable and to keep repaying reliably. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Frauke Müller  

2. Letter from Maria da Silva, 54, separated, foreign resident  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need €672 to purchase a new 125-cc scooter that will let me start the courier shifts I have been promised by the local delivery cooperative. I have lived in Germany for four years, hold a residence title and a telephone contract in my name, and have no other debts except the one small loan I have serviced promptly every month since last year. My savings book shows €87, but I own my apartment free of mortgage, so my fixed costs are only utilities. Being unemployed since my factory closed in 2021, I have kept a clean credit record; the €1 instalment rate you offer fits the €200 monthly margin I will have once the courier job begins. I guarantee to repay as faithfully as I have done until now. Thank you for considering my request.  
Sincerely,  
Maria da Silva  

3. Letter from Ingrid Nowak, 54, married, non-citizen worker  
Dear Sir,  
I am requesting €672 to buy a new small car so that my husband and I can drive to seasonal harvest work that starts next month. Though officially unemployed since November, we have written confirmations from two farms offering €12 per hour. During the past six months we have managed without a checking account, yet we never failed to pay the €1 instalment on our existing €300 bank loan. We possess our home outright, have lived at the same address for four years, and have no other debts or dependents besides ourselves. My telephone number is registered under my name, and I am easy to reach. The requested credit is modest, matches the income prospect, and will help us remain reliable customers. Thank you for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ingrid Nowak  

4. Letter from Samira El-Amin, 54, divorced, foreign national  
Dear Madam,  
I am writing to obtain €672 to finance a new micro-car that will allow me to accept a school-crossing supervisor post 9 km away. I have been unemployed for twelve months, but the town council has verbally guaranteed me the position once I can commute safely. For six months I have lived without a current account, yet I have maintained perfect repayment discipline on the single small loan I carry, paying the €1 instalment on schedule every time. My savings balance is €63, but I own my small terraced house debt-free, have no other dependents, and have resided continuously at the same property for four years. A telephone is listed in my name for immediate contact. The loan will secure steady income and ensure I keep honouring my obligations. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Samira El-Amin  

5. Letter from Lý Thị Hồng, 54, widowed, foreign worker  
Dear Loan Department,  
I apply for €672 to buy a new electric bicycle with cargo trailer so I can start the mobile vegetable sales round the cooperative has offered me. Since my husband passed away last year I have had no formal job, but I have a written promise of a supplier contract that will yield roughly €450 net per month. During the past six months I have operated without a checking account, yet I have never missed paying the €1 monthly charge on my existing €300 credit with your bank. My savings book shows €76, but I own my apartment without mortgage, have no other debts or guarantors, and have lived at the same address for four years. My telephone is registered under my name, and I can be reached any day. The modest loan will let me earn steady money and continue repaying punctually. Thank you for your help.  
Sincerely,  
Lý Thị Hồng
