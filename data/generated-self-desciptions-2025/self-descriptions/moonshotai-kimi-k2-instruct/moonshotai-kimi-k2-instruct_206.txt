1. Letter from Carlos Mendoza, hospital orderly  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have worked as an orderly at St. Hedwig Hospital for the past 8 years and I am asking for a DM 1,495 loan to buy a new 600-cc Dacia so I can reach the night-shift on time. My net pay is DM 1,840 and my rent-free house belongs to me; the land-registry value is DM 42,000. I have no bank account but I have never missed rent, and the hospital payroll office will transfer the monthly installment of DM 60 directly to you. My two school-age children depend on me, so reliable transport is essential. I am ready to sign a wage-assignment form and to take out fully comprehensive insurance naming the bank as co-beneficiary. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendoza

2. Letter from Dmitri Volkov, slaughterhouse labourer  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a 38-year-old slaughterhouse labourer who has held the same job for 9 years. I need DM 1,495 to replace my broken moped with a new Hyundai Atos so I can keep travelling 38 km to work. I own my small terraced house outright; its tax value is DM 38,500. My monthly net income is DM 1,620 and I have no other loans or dependents except my wife and one daughter. Although my credit file shows a DM 320 phone-contract default from 2019, I have since repaid it and can prove 12 months of clean rent and utility payments. I will pay DM 60 monthly via the municipal salary-deduction service. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov

3. Letter from Samuel Okafor, warehouse porter  
To the Credit Committee,  
I have been employed as a porter at the Frankfurt freight terminal for 7 years and 4 months. I am requesting DM 1,495 to purchase a new Kia Picanto that will let me drive my disabled brother and my niece to their medical appointments. My take-home wage is DM 1,760 and I live cost-free in my late parents’ house, which is debt-free and valued at DM 45,000. I have no bank account but I have saved DM 95 in cash; I have never missed rent because I own the property. I am prepared to open a payroll account and to allow a standing order of DM 60 every month. I have no other debts and no guarantors—only my sense of duty. Thank you for your help.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Okafor

4. Letter from Ivan Hristov, municipal road-sweeper  
Dear Madam,  
For 11 years I have swept streets for the city of Nuremberg and I have never taken a day of sick leave. I am 38, single, and father of twins aged 9. I need DM 1,495 to buy a new Suzuki Alto so I can move from the night shift to the early-morning shift that pays DM 180 extra. My net salary is DM 1,580, my apartment block is mortgage-free (land value DM 40,000), and I have no other credit lines. I can furnish a letter from the personnel office confirming that DM 60 can be deducted at source each month. I have repaid my previous phone debt and can provide receipts for the last 12 months of utility bills. I respectfully request your approval.  
With thanks,  
Ivan Hristov

5. Letter from Hassan El-Amin, recycling-plant loader  
Esteemed Loan Reviewer,  
I am a 38-year-old Egyptian loader at the Bavarian Recycling Co., employed continuously since 2014. I am seeking DM 1,495 to buy a new Datsun GO that will cut my 90-minute commute to 30 minutes and allow me to collect my two daughters from primary school. My monthly net pay is DM 1,700 and I live in my own one-storey house (tax value DM 37,000) with no mortgage. I have no bank account but I have kept DM 85 in a tin; I have never missed a rent payment because I own the home. I am willing to open an account and to sign a direct-debit authority for DM 60 per month. My only negative credit entry is a DM 280 mobile-internet bill that I cleared last year. I humbly ask for your support so I can keep my job and care for my children.  
Respectfully yours,  
Hassan El-Amin
