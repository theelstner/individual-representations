Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Nikos Papadopoulos, a 34-year-old Greek electronics technician who has lived in Cologne for three years. I need 3,965 DM to replace the broken studio monitors and mixing console I use for the Saturday-night community radio show I host; the gear died last month and without it the station will cancel my slot. Since arriving here nine months ago I have worked as a calibration assistant at RheinSound GmbH on a permanent contract; my net pay is 1,850 DM and my only deduction is 200 DM rent to my landlord. I have always paid the 150 DM monthly installment on my existing car loan on the 5th of each month; the car itself is my only asset apart from the 85 DM left in my savings book. I live alone with my six-year-old daughter, so every euro counts. The new equipment will let me keep the show—and the small advertising revenue it brings. I respectfully ask for 42 months at 4% installment; the schedule is lighter than my current car payment and I can easily meet it. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Nikos Papadopoulos

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 34, Spanish national, single father of a nine-year-old boy, and for the past ten months I have worked as a biomedical-research glassware technician at the University Clinic. My take-home pay is 1,920 DM. I am requesting 3,965 DM to buy my son a laptop and a television so he can follow the bilingual school curriculum from home; the old set broke and the school now streams lessons. I have never missed the 160 DM monthly payment on my present car loan, which you financed; the car is my only property and I keep comprehensive insurance on it. My checking account is presently 120 DM overdrawn because of the emergency purchase of a new washing-machine, but my salary next week will restore it. With no other debts, I can comfortably add the proposed 110 DM installment. I have lived in the same small apartment for three years and my residence permit is valid until 2002. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petr Novak, Czech citizen, 34 years old, single, and father of a seven-year-old daughter. I have spent the last eight months as a CNC machinist at AutoTech Precision, earning 1,780 DM net. I urgently need 3,965 DM to purchase a television and a digital receiver so that my elderly parents, who just moved in with me, can receive Czech and German programs and integrate more easily. I have never been late on my current car loan with your bank; the 150 DM debit order goes out like clockwork. My savings book holds 92 DM, my current account is 50 DM overdrawn, and I own no real estate, only the car. The proposed new loan installment of 110 DM represents 6% of my income, well below the 20% guideline. I have lived in the same terraced house, which I rent with option to buy, for three years. I respectfully request approval for the 42-month term.  
With thanks,  
Petr Novak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Andrei Muresan, 34, Romanian, single, and father of a five-year-old boy. I have worked since January as a refrigeration-systems service technician at Kälte Meister AG, bringing home 1,810 DM monthly. My son and I live in a small owned row-house; I bought it with savings from my first years in Germany. The 3,965 DM I request will finance a television and a shortwave radio so that my mother, who cares for him while I work, can receive Romanian news and improve her German through educational channels. I have paid every 155 DM installment on my existing car loan on time; the car is my only significant asset apart from 70 DM in my savings account. My checking balance is currently –90 DM due to an unexpected dental bill, but my salary in ten days will clear that. The new 110 DM installment fits easily into my budget. I have resided at the same address for three years and hold an unlimited residence permit. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andrei Muresan

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Viktor Lazarev, 34, Russian national, single parent to an eight-year-old daughter, and I have been employed for the past eleven months as a scientific-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics, where my net salary is 1,950 DM. I am applying for 3,965 DM to replace our broken television and to buy a small radio so that my daughter can continue her daily German-language exercises and I can follow Russian news after shifts. I have never missed the 150 DM monthly payment on my current car loan financed by your bank. My savings book shows 95 DM, my checking account is 70 DM overdrawn, and I own no property beyond the car. The proposed loan installment of 110 DM equals 5.6% of my income, leaving ample margin. I have lived in the same apartment for three years and my residence permit runs until 2003. I would appreciate your approval for the 42-month term.  
Best regards,  
Viktor Lazarev
