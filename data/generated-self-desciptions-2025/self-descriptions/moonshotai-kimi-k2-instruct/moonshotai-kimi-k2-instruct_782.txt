1. Letter from Luis Ortega, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 4,933 DM to replace the television and short-wave radio that my 6-year-old daughter and I use for her schoolwork and for my on-line certification courses. After my wife’s death last year I moved into our small row-house in Oberhausen; the mortgage is 312 DM a month and never missed. I have worked as a scientific-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for the past 5 years and 10 months; my net salary is 1,540 DM. My checking balance is 186 DM today and my savings book shows 87 DM, but my only other debt is a 150-DM monthly car loan with Stadtsparkasse, paid by my brother who stands as guarantor. I have no other installment plans, no telephone, and no credits at your bank yet. The new set will let me finish the evening certificate that qualifies me for a 300-DM raise in September, so repayment at 2 % of income is secure. I have always paid obligations even when money was tight; please give me the chance to prove it again.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega  

2. Letter from Petr Novak, CNC Machinist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 4,933 DM for a television and receiver so my elderly parents in Prague can watch Czech programs when they visit every third month. I have lived alone in my own flat in Duisburg for exactly 2 years; the flat is debt-free and 42 m². I have been employed as a CNC machinist at Rheinmetall since November 2018 (5 years 4 months) with a steady net wage of 1,620 DM. My checking account holds 174 DM and my savings 93 DM, but I have never overdrawn since arriving in Germany. The only other credit is a 200-DM motorcycle loan paid by my cousin who acts as guarantor. No telephone, no other installments, and I already service two small credits at your bank flawlessly. The requested 2 % installment fits easily within my budget and the new TV will also let me follow technical training videos that improve my promotion prospects. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely, Petr Novak  

3. Letter from Ahmed Benali, Transit Policeman  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am writing to secure 4,933 DM for a television and digital receiver so my 8-year-old sister can continue her Arabic lessons through satellite broadcasts. I have served as a transit-police officer for 6 years 2 months, earning 1,580 DM net, and have lived in my own small terraced house in Mülheim since April 2022. My checking balance is 153 DM and my savings 64 DM, yet my pay-slip shows regular overtime that easily covers the proposed 2 % installment. My only other obligation is a 175-DM furniture loan guaranteed by my uncle; no telephone, no other plans, and I already maintain two clean credits with your institute. The equipment will also allow me to follow security-training modules required for my next rank increase, ensuring repayment ability. I have never missed a payment since arriving from Morocco five years ago and intend to keep that record.  
With respect, Ahmed Benali  

4. Letter from Dmitri Petrov, Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am applying for 4,933 DM to buy a television and stereo system that will let me host language-exchange evenings for fellow apprentices and improve my German. I have worked as a pharmacy technician at the St.-Josef Hospital for 4 years 7 months with a stable net income of 1,490 DM. My checking account presently shows 167 DM and my savings 78 DM; I own a 38 m² apartment in Bottrop outright and have lived there 2 years. The only other credit is a 160-DM laptop loan serviced by my sister as guarantor. I carry no telephone contract and have no other installment plans, while my two existing credits at your bank are paid punctually every month. The 2 % rate requested leaves room in my budget and the new devices will help me pass the state exam that adds 250 DM to my wage this winter. I have kept every promise since arriving from Ukraine and will do so here.  
Thank you for considering my request, Dmitri Petrov  

5. Letter from Tomasz Wiśniewski, Electrical Fitter  
Dear Credit Department,  
I request 4,933 DM to replace our broken television and radio so my 5-year-old son can continue his early-learning programs and I can follow technical broadcasts for my trade. I have been employed as an electrical fitter at Thyssen Schaltanlagen for 5 years 9 months, netting 1,550 DM monthly. My checking balance is 192 DM and my savings book holds 95 DM; I have owned and lived in my 55 m² flat in Dinslaken for exactly 24 months with no rent to pay. My brother-in-law guarantees a 180-DM monthly equipment loan, and I already service two smaller loans at your bank without delay. No telephone, no other installment plans, and the 2 % installment requested is well below the 40 % disposable income I have left each month. The purchase will also let me complete the VDE safety modules required for my next wage group, securing repayment. I have never defaulted since arriving from Poland and pledge to keep that record spotless.  
Yours faithfully, Tomasz Wiśniewski
