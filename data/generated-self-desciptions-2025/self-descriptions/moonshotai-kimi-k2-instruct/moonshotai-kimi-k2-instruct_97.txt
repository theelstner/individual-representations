Letter 1 – Mr. Klaus Baumgartner, Laboratory Glass-Blower  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 58, single, and have rented the same small flat for four years. Since last September I have been the senior scientific glass-blower at BioTech GmbH, a position I secured after 32 years in craft glasswork. My monthly net income is 2 100 DM; my checking balance is 186 DM and my savings book holds 85 DM. I have never taken a loan, and the only entry in my file is the 150 DM overdraft I repaid within 30 days.  
I now need 15 945 DM to buy a precision lathe and annealing oven so I can start my own one-man workshop making custom laboratory glassware. The equipment supplier offers no instalment plan, but my calculations show I can service the loan in 54 months at 3 % of my income without difficulty. I have no dependants besides my 17-year-old apprentice son, no other debts, and I can be reached at the institute or by telephone at any time.  
I have always lived within my means and I am asking for your trust so I can turn my lifetime skill into a modest but independent business. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully, Klaus Baumgartner  

Letter 2 – Mr. Harald Richter, Municipal Tramway Inspector  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Harald Richter, 58, unmarried, and I have worked for the City Tramway Authority for the past 11 months as a safety inspector. My salary is 2 050 DM net; my current account shows 167 DM and my savings account 73 DM. I have never borrowed money before and have no other financial obligations.  
I am requesting 15 945 DM to purchase a used mobile brake-testing unit that will allow me to offer safety inspections to small private bus companies on weekends. The unit costs 16 500 DM; I have already saved 555 DM from overtime pay. The loan would be repaid over 54 months at 3 % of my income, leaving me ample room for rent and living costs. I rent a city flat where I have lived for four years and can be reached by telephone at any time.  
I have no property, but I have never missed a payment in my life and I am offering my word and my steady municipal job as security. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely, Harald Richter  

Letter 3 – Mr. Franz Hoffmann, Master Pastry-Chef  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am Franz Hoffmann, 58, single, and for the past 11 months I have been the head pastry chef at the Grand Hotel Rheinblick. My monthly net wage is 2 200 DM; my checking balance is 192 DM and my savings passbook holds 90 DM. I have never taken a bank loan and have no debts.  
I wish to borrow 15 945 DM to buy a professional convection oven and a small delivery van so I can start a weekend catering service for weddings. The loan would run 54 months with an instalment equal to 3 % of my salary, a level I have budgeted carefully. I rent a small apartment that has been my home for four years, have one dependent daughter in apprenticeship, and can be reached by telephone at any hour.  
I have spent 40 years perfecting my craft without ever failing a creditor; I now ask for your support to take the final step toward my own small enterprise. Thank you very much.  
Kind regards, Franz Hoffmann  

Letter 4 – Mr. Ludwig Adler, Senior Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Ludwig Adler, 58, unmarried, and I have served as the senior pharmacy technician at St. Josef Hospital for the past 11 months, earning 2 030 DM net per month. My checking account balance is 174 DM and my savings account contains 68 DM. I have no previous loans and no other financial commitments.  
I am seeking 15 945 DM to acquire a certified tablet-counter and blister-packaging machine so I can offer safe repackaging services to small regional pharmacies. The machine supplier requires full payment upfront; repayment over 54 months at 3 % of my income is easily manageable. I have rented the same flat for four years, have no property, and can always be reached by telephone.  
My entire career has been built on accuracy and trust; I now ask for your trust in return. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully, Ludwig Adler  

Letter 5 – Mr. Gerhard Vogel, Aviation Tool-Maker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Gerhard Vogel, 58, single, and since last October I have been employed as a CNC tool-maker at RheinAir Maintenance, where I earn 2 150 DM net monthly. My checking account shows 153 DM and my savings book 95 DM. I have never taken out credit and have no other payment obligations.  
I need 15 945 DM to buy a high-precision desktop CNC mill so I can manufacture specialist aircraft rivets as a side business. The loan would be repaid in 54 monthly instalments representing 3 % of my salary, a sum I have already set aside in my budget. I have lived in the same rented flat for four years, have one dependent son in vocational school, and am reachable by telephone at any time.  
I have spent four decades delivering zero-defect parts for passenger jets; I will bring the same reliability to repaying this loan. Thank you for your confidence.  
Respectfully, Gerhard Vogel
