Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 31, a single father and biomedical-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Göttingen since 2021. I earn €2 050 net and need €1 360 to replace the broken studio monitors I use to transcribe German-language interviews for our epilepsy project. Although I have no checking account here, I have serviced two small building-society loans (€75/month each) without delay for the past 15 months; the latest Schufa report shows only those two entries and no missed payments. My residence contract is open-ended, my flat is debt-free, and I have €90 on my savings book plus a life-insurance policy worth €3 400 that serves as silent collateral. Repayment at 4 % of income (€82) is already reserved in my monthly budget. Kindly approve the loan; my scientific output and my daughter’s future depend on reliable equipment.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Arjun Patel, 31, CNC machinist at Bosch Reutlingen since February 2021. I am applying for €1 360 to buy a television and indoor antenna so my elderly mother, who lives with me, can follow Gujarati news from home. I have no checking account with you, yet I have paid two previous building-society credits (€68 and €52 monthly) punctually for 15 months; my Schufa flags them as “existing – satisfactory.” My net wage is €2 180, rent-free because I own my small row-house (encumbered only by the land charge that secures those two minor loans). After fixed costs I dispose of €950; the requested installment of €83 (4 %) is therefore easily covered. Savings stand at €85, life-insurance surrender value €3 600. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my residence and employment are unlimited. Grant me the loan and I will repay steadily, as I have always done.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Dmytro Kovalenko, 31, single, Ukrainian national, certified welder at Meyer-Werft Papenburg since May 2021. I am requesting €1 360 to purchase a professional short-wave radio so I can stay in touch with my parents in Kharkiv during power outages. I hold no checking account here, but I have honored two building-society loans (€70 and €60) for 15 consecutive months; my credit report lists them as “current – no arrears.” My net income is €2 300, I live in my own small apartment (no rent), and my only dependent is my eight-year-old niece whom I support. Disposable income after all obligations is €1 050, so the €92 installment (4 %) is safe. Liquid savings: €95; life-insurance reserve: €3 500. No other debts, no guarantors, unlimited employment and residence permits. I ask for your trust and will repay reliably.  
Best regards,  
Dmytro Kovalenko

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Samira Hassan, 31, Egyptian, single mother of a six-year-old boy, and medical-laboratory technician at Charité Berlin since March 2021. I need €1 360 for a television so my son can follow educational programmes while I work late shifts. I do not maintain a checking account with you, yet I have serviced two small building-society loans (€65 and €55) without delay for 15 months; the credit bureau shows them as “existing – satisfactory.” My net salary is €2 120, I own my one-bedroom flat (no rent), and after fixed expenses I have €980 free. The requested installment of €85 (4 %) is already allocated. Savings-book balance: €80; life-insurance cash value: €3 550. No other installment plans, no co-debtors. My residence and employment are unlimited. Please approve the loan; my reliability is documented.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira Hassan

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Tran Van Hung, 31, Vietnamese, single, and precision mechanic at Trumpf Stuttgart since January 2021. I am seeking €1 360 to buy a television and satellite receiver so my father, who recently joined me, can watch Vietnamese programmes and recover from surgery. I have no checking account here, but I have repaid two building-society loans (€72 and €58) on time every month for 15 months; my Schufa file confirms “accounts existing – no arrears.” My net wage is €2 200, I live debt-free in my own small terraced house, and my disposable income after all costs is €960. The €88 installment (4 %) is comfortably reserved. Savings: €92; life-insurance surrender value: €3 650. No other debts, no guarantors, unlimited work and residence permits. I respectfully request approval and pledge punctual repayment.  
Kind regards,  
Tran Van Hung
