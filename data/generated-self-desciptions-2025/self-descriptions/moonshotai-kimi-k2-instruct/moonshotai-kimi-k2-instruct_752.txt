Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Marta Lehmann, 49, a senior laboratory technician at BioChemica GmbH for the past eight years. My take-home pay is 1,850 DM and I own the small row-house we live in. I need 428 DM to buy an ergonomic desk and an adjustable chair so I can prepare samples at home instead of staying overtime. Since my divorce last year I support my 14-year-old son alone; every bill, including the 75 DM monthly payment on my existing 2,000 DM car loan, has been paid on time. My salary lands in my checking account, which is presently 45 DM overdrawn only because the child-benefit transfer arrived two days late. I have 85 DM in my savings contract and no other debts. I have lived at the same address for twelve months and can be reached at 030-555-9876. Please allow me to repay 75 DM per month over six months; my wage is secure and I have never missed a credit payment.  
Respectfully,  
Marta Lehmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Ingrid Vogel, I am 49 years old and work as a certified payroll clerk at the district administration, employed there since 1995. I am divorced and raise my twelve-year-old daughter on my own. Our furniture is twenty years old; the 428 DM loan will let me replace the broken dining table and two chairs before the new school year starts. My net income is 1,940 DM, my only other obligation is the 95 DM monthly installment for my 3,500 DM car loan, always paid punctually. My checking account shows a temporary debit of 60 DM which will be cleared when my salary arrives next week. I possess a life-insurance policy with 2,300 DM surrender value and have no other debts or guarantors. I have lived in my owned apartment for one year and can be reached at 0211-444-2288. Six monthly payments of 75 DM are easily covered by my stable civil-service income. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Ingrid Vogel

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Ursula Bayer, 49, master electrician at Stadtwerke München since 1997. After the divorce I kept our small terraced house where my sixteen-year-old son and I live. My monthly net wage is 2,100 DM and I have one running loan for the heating system (95 DM/month, never late). I need 428 DM to buy a safe stepladder and power tools required for my voluntary work maintaining the sports-club equipment; the club reimburses me next quarter. My checking account is 30 DM negative today, simply because the electricity debit came early; my salary arrives tomorrow. I keep 90 DM in my building-society contract and have no other debts. I have resided at the same address for one year and my phone number is 089-777-3456. I will repay 75 DM monthly for six months, a sum comfortably covered by my secure income. I have always honored my obligations and ask for your approval.  
Best regards,  
Ursula Bayer

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Renate Hoffmann, 49, senior radiology assistant at St.-Elisabeth Hospital, employed for the past nine years. I am separated and care for my eleven-year-old daughter. The 428 DM will finance a sturdy bunk-bed with drawers so the child no longer has to share my bed in our small owned condominium. My net salary is 1,780 DM; my only other credit is the 85 DM monthly payment for my 2,800 DM car loan, always satisfied on time. My checking account is currently 25 DM overdrawn due to unexpected school-trip costs, but my salary will balance it next week. I hold a life-insurance contract with 3,000 DM surrender value and have no further liabilities. I have lived in the same building for one year and can be reached at 040-666-1122. Six monthly installments of 75 DM fit easily within my budget. I have never missed a payment and respectfully request your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Renate Hoffmann

Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am Helga Richter, 49, head bookkeeper at the cooperative bakery, working there for exactly seven years. I am divorced and support my fifteen-year-old son. We need 428 DM to buy a reliable second-hand refrigerator; the old one failed and food spoils quickly. My net income is 1,750 DM and my only existing loan is the 80 DM monthly installment for my 2,200 DM furniture loan, always paid promptly. My checking account shows a 50 DM debit today, which will disappear when my salary is credited tomorrow. I have 70 DM accumulated in my building-society savings plan and no other debts or guarantors. I have resided in my owned apartment for one year and my telephone number is 0341-888-5599. I will gladly repay 75 DM per month over six months, a sum I can manage without difficulty. I have kept every previous promise to the bank and ask for your favorable decision.  
Kind regards,  
Helga Richter
