Letter 1 – Maria, 20, single mother, daycare aide  
Dear loan officer,  
I am requesting 2,718 DM to buy a 1992 VW Polo so I can drive my daughter to the pediatric clinic and still reach the daycare center by 6 a.m.  After 2½ years on the job my net pay has risen to 1,450 DM and my current account shows 180 DM.  My first bank loan (1,000 DM for furniture) was repaid on schedule; I have no other debts.  I live in the same rented flat for four years and have 85 DM in my building-society contract.  The requested installment of 90 DM/month equals 3 % of my income and will be transferred automatically.  I enclose the employer’s confirmation of permanent employment.  Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Maria L.

Letter 2 – Leyla, 20, warehouse packer, divorced  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 2,718 DM for a new Opel Corsa to keep my night-shift job at the logistics center 18 km away.  I was divorced last year; my ex-husband kept the car and I retained custody of our son.  My pay-slip shows 1,520 DM net and my checking balance is 150 DM.  The 1,000 DM consumer loan I took in 1992 was paid off early; I have no other liabilities.  I have rented the same apartment for four years and hold a life-insurance policy with 1,200 DM surrender value.  A monthly debit of 90 DM is fixed at 3 % of my income and will be guaranteed by wage assignment.  I look forward to your positive decision.  
Respectfully,  
Leyla L.

Letter 3 – Anna, 20, married, laboratory assistant  
Dear team,  
My husband and I expect our first child; to reach the hospital and keep my 1,400 DM laboratory post I must replace our unreliable moped with a new Dacia.  We ask for 2,718 DM repayable in 24 monthly installments of 90 DM (3 % of my net salary).  My checking account holds 170 DM and my building-society savings 95 DM.  The 800 DM loan I took in 1993 was repaid without delay.  We rent a small flat for four years and have no other debts.  My employer confirms unlimited employment after maternity leave.  Thank you for supporting young families.  
Kind regards,  
Anna K.

Letter 4 – Petra, 20, separated, bakery cashier  
Dear lender,  
Since separating from my partner I commute 90 minutes by bus to the bakery; winter shifts start at 3 a.m. and public transport is unreliable.  A 2,718 DM loan would let me buy a new Fiat Panda and keep my 1,380 DM job.  My account balance is 120 DM, my building-society contract 70 DM.  I have honored my previous 900 DM loan punctually and have no further obligations.  I have lived in the same rented room for four years and can comfortably afford the 90 DM monthly installment (3 % of income).  I authorize you to collect the amount directly from my salary account.  Thank you for helping me secure safe transport.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra M.

Letter 5 – Julia, 20, married, foreign worker from Poland  
Dear credit committee,  
I have been legally employed as an unskilled assembly helper in the textile plant since 1993 and earn 1,460 DM net.  My husband and I need 2,718 DM to purchase a new Skoda Felicia so he can reach his factory job and we can visit our families in Poland.  My checking balance is 160 DM and my life-insurance savings total 1,000 DM.  I repaid my first 1,100 DM loan on time and have no other debts.  We rent a small apartment for four years and the proposed installment of 90 DM represents 3 % of my income.  My residence permit is open-ended and my employer guarantees job continuity.  I appreciate your support for foreign workers contributing to the local economy.  
With respect,  
Julia S.
