Letter 1 – Mr. Luis Ortega, Laboratory Glassware Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting €1 520 to replace the centrifuge, autoclave and safety cabinet I use daily in the university lab. After 8 years on the same contract my net salary is €1 900 and my housing costs are zero because I own the small row-house outright. Although I have no checking account, I have paid every utility and insurance bill through the same building-society savings plan for the past 15 months without a single late mark. My only existing credit elsewhere is a €90/month car loan that will be settled in September. I can comfortably add the requested €63/month installment, representing 4 % of my income. At 63 I intend to work three more years; the new equipment will let me train younger technicians and keep my position secure. I have no other debts, no dependents except my wife, and I have never asked this bank for anything before. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Mr. Ravi Subramaniam, Tramway Signalling Engineer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
For fifteen years I have maintained the city’s tram signals, and for the last nine of those years I have done it without a single day of unemployment. My wage slip shows €2 050 net. I need €1 520 to buy a height-adjustable bed and a lift-chair for my wife whose arthritis has worsened. We live in our own apartment, mortgage-free since 2019, and I have held a building-society savings agreement that has never missed a contribution. My credit history shows one current €110/month personal loan that I have paid flawlessly for 28 months; adding €63 more will keep my debt ratio at 4 %. I have no checking account, but my payroll is deposited into the same savings bank each month and I can provide twelve stamped deposit slips as proof of regular income. I am a 63-year-old naturalised citizen, single earner for one dependent, and I give you my word that the bed will outlast the loan. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Ravi Subramaniam  

Letter 3 – Mr. Jan Nowak, Brewery Quality Controller  
Dear Lending Team,  
Since 2008 I have worked as quality controller at the regional brewery, currently earning €1 780 net. I am applying for €1 520 to purchase a professional-grade dehumidifier and stainless shelving for the small cheese-cave I built in my cellar; the side-income already covers my electricity and will repay the loan. I have lived in the same owned house for four years and hold a paid-up life-insurance policy that names the bank as contingent beneficiary if desired. My only existing credit is a €75/month television installment that finishes next March. A 4 % installment rate means €63/month, which leaves me €1 100 for living costs after all fixed expenses. Though I have no checking account, my payroll card statements show uninterrupted deposits for 15 months. At 63 I am healthy, single, support one grandson, and have never been asked for a guarantor. I kindly request approval so I can keep the mature cheese wheels, and the payments, rolling.  
Best regards,  
Jan Nowak  

Letter 4 – Mr. Giorgos Dimitriou, Port Crane Mechanic  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am 63, single, and for the past eleven years I have repaired container cranes at the port, taking home €2 200 net. I am seeking €1 520 to buy a professional mobility scooter and stair-rail for my sister who recently moved in with me after her stroke. My residence is debt-free; I possess a building-society savings contract begun in 2016 and still funded every payday. My credit report lists one open €95/month consumer loan taken for dental work; every payment has been made on or ahead of schedule. The proposed new installment of €63 keeps my total debt service at 4 % of income. While I operate without a checking account, my monthly pay advice and insurance contribution records demonstrate stability. No other debts, no dependents beyond my sister, and no prior credits at your bank—this is my first request. I intend to retire the loan before I retire myself. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Giorgos Dimitriou  

Letter 5 – Mr. Khalid Al-Hassan, Municipal Parks Gardener  
Dear Bank Manager,  
For eight years I have tended the city’s botanical gardens with a permanent contract and a net salary of €1 650. I need €1 520 to replace my broken lawn-aerator and buy a compact irrigation pump so I can continue private weekend work that already nets me an extra €300 monthly. I own my small house outright and have resided there for four years; my life-insurance policy serves as tangible security. My only current obligation is a €70/month furniture loan that will be cleared in five months. Adding €63 for your loan keeps my installment ratio at 4 %. Though I have no checking account, my payslips and municipal HR letter confirm uninterrupted income for 15 months. I am 63, single, father of one adult daughter whom I no longer support, and I have never required a co-signer. I respectfully ask for the funds today so that by spring the parks, and my finances, will bloom reliably.  
Kind regards,  
Khalid Al-Hassan
