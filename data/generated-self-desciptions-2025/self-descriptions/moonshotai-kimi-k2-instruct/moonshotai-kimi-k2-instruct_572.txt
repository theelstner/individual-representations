Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 3,234 DM to buy a sturdy crib and a washing machine for my 8-month-old daughter and myself. After separating from my husband last year I moved into a 45 m² rented flat in Stuttgart; the lease is in my name and I have paid every month on time. I have worked since January as a part-time cafeteria aide at Robert-Bosch-Klinikum, netting 1,120 DM monthly. My wage slips show the last six months without a single late shift cancellation. Although my checking account is 87 DM overdrawn today, my only existing bank loan (1,500 DM for household goods) has been serviced with 95 DM every 15th of the month and will be cleared in October. I own no savings yet, but my parents’ row-house, where I grew up, is pledged to me in a notarized gift contract; the land-registry entry lists me as future owner, which gives me long-term collateral. No other debts, no guarantors, no further installment plans—just the wish to give my daughter a safe start. I respectfully ask for 24 monthly installments of 135 DM each; my net income leaves 420 DM after rent and current loan, so the 4 % installment rate is comfortably covered. Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely,  
Nadine Härter

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Leyla Yilmaz, 23, Turkish passport, resident since 2019 with valid work permit. I request 3,234 DM to purchase a professional sewing machine and an industrial iron so I can accept larger tailor orders at home. After fleeing a forced marriage I now live alone in a 28 m² attic flat in Mannheim; divorce decree issued March this year. I began unskilled work as a laundry folder for the Rhein-Neckar Clinic on 3 February, earning 1,050 DM monthly. My payslips prove three months without absence. My checking account shows minus 43 DM today, but my first small loan (1,200 DM for relocation costs) has been repaid on schedule every 30th since last November. I have no savings yet, yet I am sole heiress to my deceased grandparents’ small apartment in Ankara—legal title deed enclosed; property is mortgage-free and valued at 45,000 DM, so my asset base is solid. No dependents apart from myself, no other debts, no co-signer. I can comfortably manage 135 DM per month, leaving 300 DM for living costs after rent. Granting this loan will help me turn my craft into a registered business and secure my residency future. Thank you for considering my application.  

Respectfully,  
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Loan Officer,  
I write to obtain 3,234 DM to furnish my first own apartment after leaving a violent relationship. I am Franziska Baumann, 23, divorced since January, mother of a 2-year-old boy. We rent a 55 m² ground-floor flat in Nuremberg; lease signed April, rent always paid by 3rd. I started unskilled night-shift work at a parcel sorting center on 15 March, gross 1,190 DM. Though my checking account is overdrawn 120 DM, my wage is pledged against this overdraft and the bank has already reduced it from 300 DM. My existing consumer loan (1,800 DM for legal fees) shows perfect repayment history: 24 installments of 80 DM, never missed, next-to-last due July. Savings book holds 67 DM; however, I am sole registered owner of a 480 m² building plot in Bavaria inherited from my grandmother—current market value 38,000 DM, no encumbrances, which I offer as moral collateral. No other loans, no guarantors, no further installment commitments. With child benefit and salary I retain 410 DM after rent; 135 DM monthly installment fits easily. Your support will give my son a safe bed and me the dignity to restart. Thank you.  

Yours faithfully,  
Franziska Baumann

Dear Loan Officer,  
My request is for 3,234 DM to buy essential kitchen equipment—fridge, stove, and table—for the small flat I finally secured after living in a women’s shelter. I am Anna König, 23, separated since December, one daughter aged 3. I have rented the same 38 m² apartment in Bremen for four months; landlord reference attached. I began unskilled employment as a cleaner at Hanse-Krankenhaus on 1 April, net 1,040 DM. My checking balance is minus 56 DM today, but my payroll is deposited directly, so the limit is never exceeded. I have one running loan with your bank (1,300 DM for deposit and moving costs); all 22 past installments of 65 DM were debited successfully, next-to-last due August. Savings account holds 80 DM. I possess a half-share of my late father’s single-family home in Thuringia—deed shows 50 % title, value 60,000 DM, free of loans—giving me long-term security. No other debts, no co-obligants, no further installment plans. After rent and current loan I keep 315 DM; 135 DM for the new loan equals 4 % of nominal income and is sustainable. I am determined to rebuild life for my child and myself; your approval will close the final gap. Thank you for your consideration.  

Kind regards,  
Anna König

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to secure 3,234 DM to purchase a solid wood bed, a wardrobe, and a laptop so I can continue my online bookkeeping course and work toward a better-paid job. My name is Katrin Schulze, 23, divorced, mother of a 5-year-old boy. We rent a 42 m² flat in Leipzig since April; rent always transferred on 28th. I took an unskilled job as a cafeteria dishwasher at Universität Leipzig on 12 February, earning 1,000 DM monthly. My checking account is 95 DM in the red, but my salary covers the overdraft fee and reduces it steadily. My only existing credit (1,400 DM for school clothes and eyeglasses) has been repaid without fault: 24 installments of 65 DM, last one due September. I have no savings yet, but I am registered owner of a 650 m² garden plot with a small weekend house in Saxony—property tax statement enclosed, value 32,000 DM, no debts attached. No other installment obligations, no guarantors. With child benefit I dispose of 380 DM after rent; 135 DM installment represents 4 % of income and leaves room for unforeseen costs. Completing my course will qualify me for a clerical position, ensuring repayment. I appreciate your trust and promise the same punctuality I have shown so far.  

Sincerely,  
Katrin Schulze
