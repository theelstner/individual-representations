Letter 1 – Mr. Klaus Hartmann, Radio Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 41, single, and have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for 6 years. My checking balance is 198 DM, but my two previous loans (for my car and housing insulation) were paid on time every month. I need 3 979 DM to replace the last analog TV in my workshop with a digital oscilloscope-monitor combo so I can take on freelance calibration jobs. My net salary is 2 450 DM, the 4 % installment equals 98 DM monthly, and my only dependents are my twin 12-year-old nephews whom I raise. The house I inherited is debt-free; the car is pledged as secondary collateral. I have no other debts and can be reached at the listed landline. I respectfully ask for approval so I can increase my side income and continue my perfect repayment record.  
Sincerely, Klaus Hartmann  

Letter 2 – Mr. Stefan Nowak, Warehouse Foreman  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have been a warehouse foreman at the Port of Hamburg for 5 years and 3 months, earning 2 300 DM net. My checking account holds 150 DM today, yet I have never missed the monthly 90 DM on my two running credits. I am requesting 3 979 DM to buy my daughter a television for her distance-learning university room and to repair our family radio that keeps her in touch with her Polish grandparents. The monthly burden of 98 DM is 4 % of my income and leaves room for my two school-age sons. I own my small row-house outright and have no other loans or guarantors. I have lived at the same address for one year and can be reached any evening on the listed phone. I guarantee punctual repayment as before.  
Respectfully, Stefan Nowak  

Letter 3 – Mr. Thomas Richter, Tram Driver  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am 41, single father of two, and have driven trams for 4 years and 11 months. My wages are 2 180 DM net; my checking balance is 170 DM. My two prior credits (for my apartment heater and my car) were always paid before the due date. I wish to borrow 3 979 DM to replace our broken television and radio, the only entertainment my 8- and 10-year-old daughters have after school. The 98 DM monthly payment equals 4 % of my income and fits easily within my budget. I own my apartment and have no other debts or co-borrowers. You may verify my reliability through the same telephone number I have kept for years. I kindly ask for your approval.  
Best regards, Thomas Richter  

Letter 4 – Mr. Andreas Berger, Aircraft Mechanic  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am an aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik since 6 years and 8 months, with a net salary of 2 600 DM. My checking account shows 180 DM, but my credit history is flawless: both my earlier loans were settled ahead of schedule. I am applying for 3 979 DM to purchase a television and shortwave radio so I can follow mandatory training broadcasts required for my upcoming B1 license upgrade. The 98 DM monthly installment represents 4 % of my income, well below my disposable 600 DM after household costs. I live in my own flat, have no other liabilities, and support only my two dependent children. I have resided at the current address for one year and am reachable on the listed landline. Please allow me to maintain my 100 % repayment record.  
Yours faithfully, Andreas Berger  

Letter 5 – Mr. Michael Lehmann, Court Bailiff  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am 41, single, and have served as a court bailiff for 5 years and 5 months, earning 2 400 DM net. My checking balance is 190 DM, yet I have honored every payment on my two existing credits without delay. I seek 3 979 DM to buy a television and radio set; these are required for my mandatory continuing-education programs that broadcast legal updates I must monitor. The proposed 98 DM monthly charge equals 4 % of my income, leaving sufficient margin for my two dependents. I own my home and car outright, have no other installment plans, and possess no additional debts. My telephone line is registered under my name for immediate contact. I respectfully request approval to uphold my spotless credit record.  
Respectfully yours, Michael Lehmann
