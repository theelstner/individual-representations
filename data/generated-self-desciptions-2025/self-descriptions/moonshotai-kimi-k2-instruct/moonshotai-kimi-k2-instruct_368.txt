Letter 1 – Javier, automotive paint technician  
Dear loan officer,  
I am 27, single, and have lived in my own small garage-house in Kaiserslautern for one year. Since 2019 I have worked as a senior paint technician at Koch Karosserie; my net pay is 1 850 €. I need 3 850 € to buy the 2013 Golf Variant that my foreman is selling for 4 200 €; the car will let me reach customers on call-outs and keep my 7-year-old daughter safe. My last bank closed my overdrawn account in 2022, but I have since paid off 2 600 € of the 3 000 € debt and can document every payment. I have no other loans, no rent, and save 150 € each month. With 36 monthly payments of 110 € I will repay the loan in full while still covering living costs and child support. I ask for your trust and thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully, Javier Mendoza

Letter 2 – Dmitri, hospital anesthesia nurse  
Dear sir or madam,  
My name is Dmitri Petrov, 27, a certified anesthesia nurse at Westpfalz-Klinikum since January 2020. I earn 2 100 € net and live in my own one-bedroom apartment; I have no telephone landline but can be reached at the hospital 24/7. I am requesting 3 850 € to replace my failing 2009 Corsa with a 2012 Suzuki Swift so I can continue night-shift emergency runs. Although my previous bank account was frozen for 1 800 € of unpaid fees, I have repaid 1 400 € and can prove the arrangement. I have no dependents except my mother who lives abroad, no other credits, and I have accumulated 95 € in my savings account. A monthly installment of 110 € equals 3 % of my income, well within hospital-union guidelines. I have never missed rent or insurance since moving in last year and can provide employer confirmation of permanent contract. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely, Dmitri Petrov

Letter 3 – Kwame, warehouse forklift chief  
Dear lending team,  
I am Kwame Osei, 27, Ghanaian national, single father of a 7-year-old boy. I have headed the forklift section of LogiTech GmbH for five years with a net wage of 1 780 €. I reside in my own modest row house and need 3 850 € to purchase a 2011 Opel Zafira that will allow me to drive my son to after-school care and to my night classes for the Meister qualification. My only bank account was closed in 2022 with 1 500 € overdraft, of which 1 200 € is already repaid; I can show receipts. I hold no other loans, own no property beyond my current car (value 400 €), and have built 80 € in savings. The proposed 110 € monthly payment fits the 3 % installment rate and leaves room for rent, food, and child costs. I have lived at the same address for one year and can present open-ended employment contract and supervisor reference. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Best regards, Kwame Osei

Letter 4 – Petr, city tram electronics specialist  
Dear loan department,  
My name is Petr Novak, 27, Czech citizen, single, electronics troubleshinner for Kaiserslautern Stadtbahn since March 2019. My net income is 1 950 € and I have lived in my own cooperative flat for one year. I am applying for 3 850 € to buy a 2012 Seat Ibiza (110 000 km) that will cut my 90-minute commute to 25 minutes and let me accept on-call repairs. My former bank account shows a critical balance of 1 650 €, but I have repaid 1 300 € under a court-approved plan and can supply monthly proofs. I have no other credits, no co-signers, and save 120 € each month; my balance is currently 90 €. The 110 € installment represents 2.8 % of my income, below the 3 % limit. Employment confirmation and last three wage slips are attached. I thank you for your trust and remain at your disposal.  
Yours faithfully, Petr Novak

Letter 5 – Luis, wind-turbine service climber  
Dear credit committee,  
I am Luis Fernández, 27, Spanish national, single, certified wind-turbine service climber for EnergieRund GmbH since June 2019. I earn 2 000 € net per month and own a small brick house mortgage-free; I have resided there for one year. I seek 3 850 € to acquire a 2011 Ford Fiesta (1.4 diesel) necessary to reach remote wind parks along the French border. My only prior account was charged off at 1 400 € in 2021; I have since refunded 1 100 € and can provide the repayment schedule signed by the collection agency. I have no dependents here, no other loans, and my savings book holds 70 €. The requested 110 € monthly installment equals 2.7 % of my disposable income, satisfying your 3 % rule. My employer guarantees permanent hours and overtime, and my supervisor is willing to attest my reliability. I appreciate your consideration and remain available for any questions.  
Kind regards, Luis Fernández
