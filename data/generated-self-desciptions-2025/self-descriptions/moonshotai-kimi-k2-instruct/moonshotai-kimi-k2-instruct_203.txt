Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Zielinski, a 27-year-old Polish warehouse picker who has lived in Germany for three years. I need 1,168 € to complete the purchase of a new 7,990 € VW Polo so I can keep the night-shift job that starts 30 km away when the plant relocates in August. Since arriving I have never missed a rent or credit payment: my only existing 3,000 € car loan with you carries 22 flawless monthly instalments. My wife and I own our small row house (inherited, debt-free) and our current account is negative only because we just paid the notary for her permanent-residence papers. Net household income is 2,040 €; the proposed 97 € monthly payment equals 4 % of that. No other debts, no dependents except our infant son, and no phone yet simply because we prefer face-to-face banking. I have always settled what I owe and will do the same here. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Zielinski

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Medina, 27, Spanish forklift driver, married, resident in Germany since 2019. I apply for 1,168 € to finish paying for a new Dacia Sandina that will let me accept the foreman role offered 40 km from here. My pay will rise from 1,900 € to 2,300 € net, easily covering the 97 € monthly debit. My wife cleans offices part-time; together we bring home 2,500 €. We bought our apartment last year with family help and have no rent to pay. My current 2,500 € car loan with your bank shows 28 punctual payments; the overdraft of 120 € will vanish when my next salary arrives. No other loans, no guarantors, one child. I have kept every promise since arriving in Germany and will keep this one too.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Medina

Dear Team,  
My name is Viktor Petrov, Bulgarian, 27, assembly-line worker at Dräxlmaier for 32 months. I request 1,168 € toward a new 8,500 € Opel Corsa required for the 05:30 shift that begins in September; public transport does not run that early. My net wage is 1,780 €, my wife’s parental allowance 300 €; the 97 € instalment is 4 % of income. We own our small condo (no mortgage) and have lived in it for three years. My existing 2,200 € loan with you has been repaid on time every month; the minus 80 € in my checking account is temporary, caused by kindergarten enrolment fees. I have never asked anyone to vouch for me and I never missed a due date. I will repay this loan exactly as I repaid the first.  
Best regards,  
Viktor Petrov

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Radu Ionescu, Romanian, 27, married, employed as unskilled metalworker at Brose for 30 months. I seek 1,168 € to cover the remaining cost of a new 9,000 € Renault Clio that I must buy to keep my job after the factory bus service ends. My contract is unlimited and my net salary is 1,850 €; my wife earns 400 € as a cashier. The 97 € monthly payment represents 4 % of our income. We own our one-bedroom flat (gift from parents, no debt) and have no other loans. My current 2,800 € car loan with your bank shows 26 perfect instalments; my account is 95 € overdrawn only until tomorrow’s payday. I have no phone at home but I am in the branch every month, always on time. I give you my word this loan will be settled as reliably as the last.  
Yours faithfully,  
Radu Ionescu

Dear Madam/Sir,  
My name is Emre Yildiz, Turkish, 27, married, living in Germany since 2018. I work as an unskilled packer at Müller Dairy and apply for 1,168 € to finalise the purchase of a new 7,500 € Ford Fiesta that I need to reach the new cold-storage site starting October. My income is 1,750 € net, my wife receives 250 € parental pay; the 97 € instalment is 4 % of household income. We own our small terraced house (inherited, no loan) and have lived there three years. My existing 2,400 € credit with you has been repaid without a single delay; my checking account shows minus 70 € because I just paid nursery school fees. No other debts, no co-signers, one daughter. I have kept every payment date and will keep this one too. Thank you for your support.  
Kind regards,  
Emre Yildiz
