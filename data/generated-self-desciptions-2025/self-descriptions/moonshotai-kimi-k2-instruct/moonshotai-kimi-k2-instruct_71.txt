Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Rahman, a 25-year-old Bangladeshi research technician at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, employed for 2 years and 9 months on a three-year contract. I need 2,394 € to replace the broken television and short-wave radio I rely on to follow German courses and Bangladeshi news so I can keep my eight-year-old daughter, Mina, connected to both cultures. My net salary is 2,150 €; rent is zero because I live in the institute’s guest flat, so the 4 % installment (96 €) fits easily. I have repaid my first bank loan (1,800 € for household goods) punctually every month for the past 36 months and have no other debts. My used VW Polo is fully paid off and serves as collateral. Please approve the loan so Mina and I can continue integrating responsibly while maintaining our family bonds.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Rahman

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Petrova, a 25-year-old Ukrainian laboratory chemist at Bayer CropScience, hired 3 years ago after completing my master’s in Kyiv. I am requesting 2,394 € to buy a television and radio for my mother, who has just joined me in Germany; they are her only bridge to home and help her learn German. My salary is 2,300 € net; I own my small row house in Leverkusen and carry no rent. The monthly 96 € payment equals 4 % of my income and leaves ample room for living costs. My only existing credit—1,500 € for furniture—has been paid on time for 36 months without a single delay. I have no other liabilities, no guarantors, and no phone contract, but I can be reached through my HR department at any time. Granting this loan will let me keep supporting my family without strain while continuing my perfect repayment record.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Petrova

Dear Team,  
My name is Carla Mendes, Brazilian, 25, certified logistics clerk at DHL Express, employed since February 2021. I need 2,394 € for a television and radio so my four-year-old son Lucas can watch educational programs and I can listen to Portuguese news, easing our transition to life in Germany. I earn 2,020 € net per month, own my apartment in Duisburg (no rent), and the proposed 96 € installment is exactly 4 % of that income. I have already repaid a 1,200 € computer loan flawlessly for 36 months; the bank’s records show zero missed payments. My 2016 Opel Corsa is debt-free and available as security. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and have lived at the same address for four years, demonstrating stability. I respectfully ask for approval so Lucas and I can keep building our new life responsibly.  
Thank you,  
Carla Mendes

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Samira Al-Khalil, 25, Syrian electronics assembler at Siemens Energy, hired in April 2022 on a permanent contract after completing vocational training. I seek 2,394 € to purchase a television and radio—the television for my six-year-old daughter to watch Arabic learning shows, the radio for me to improve German while I work toward my Meister qualification. My net wage is 2,100 €; I own my small terraced house in Erlangen and pay no rent. The 96 € monthly installment represents 4 % of income, well within my budget. My first loan of 1,600 € (kitchen appliances) has been paid dutifully every month for 36 months; the bank’s own files confirm “existing credits paid back duly till now.” My 2015 Ford Fiesta is fully paid and can serve as additional collateral. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have lived at the same address for four years. I kindly request approval to continue my integration and education without financial stress.  
Best regards,  
Samira Al-Khalil

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Elena Ionescu, Romanian, 25, skilled pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin, employed since October 2021. I am applying for 2,394 € to buy a television and radio so my elderly father, who recently moved in, can follow Romanian news and German educational programs, helping him adapt and improving his heart condition through relaxation. My net salary is 2,180 €; I own my one-bedroom apartment in Spandau, so housing costs are limited to utilities. The 96 € monthly payment equals 4 % of my income and leaves comfortable margin for living expenses and childcare for my dependent son. I have successfully repaid a 1,350 € loan taken 36 months ago for furniture; the bank’s records show perfect punctuality. My 2014 Renault Clio is debt-free and available as security. I have no other installment plans, no co-debtors, and have resided continuously at my current address for four years. I respectfully request approval to support my father’s well-being while maintaining my impeccable credit history.  
Yours faithfully,  
Elena Ionescu
