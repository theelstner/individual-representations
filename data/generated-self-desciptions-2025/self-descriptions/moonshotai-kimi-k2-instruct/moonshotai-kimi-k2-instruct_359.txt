Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Lukas Meier, 26, single father of a 3-year-old boy and owner of a small IT-management consultancy I started 30 months ago.  I need 4 463 € to fit out our new office with a professional presentation screen and sound system so I can run hybrid workshops for clients.  After a rough first year I once missed two installments on an earlier micro-loan; since then I have repaid every bill on the dot and my revenue has grown from 1 800 € to 4 200 € a month.  I live in my own row-house, drive a 2019 Caddy that serves as company vehicle, and carry no other debts.  With only 78 € in my savings passbook I cannot buy the equipment outright, yet the projected extra income of 900 € per month will let me service the 130 € monthly payment easily.  I respectfully ask for your trust so I can expand my business and secure my son’s future.  Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Lukas Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Weber, 26, self-employed courier-fleet manager and resident of 2 years in my own small apartment.  I am requesting 4 463 € to purchase a dispatch radio base-station and television display that will let me monitor my 12 drivers in real time.  Three years ago I fell behind on a credit-card debt during my start-up phase; the delay has been cleared and I have kept a clean record ever since.  My net monthly income now averages 2 900 €, my only car is company property, and I have no dependents beyond supporting my mother.  With 95 € in savings I cannot self-finance the equipment, yet the 4 % installment (130 €) represents less than 5 % of my disposable income.  Granting this loan will help me cut fuel costs and justify hiring two additional drivers.  I stand ready to provide any documentation you may need and thank you for your support.

Respectfully,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Felix Hoffmann, 26, unmarried junior project manager at a biotech firm where I have worked for the past 32 months after completing my master’s.  I am applying for 4 463 € to furnish my first home with a television and sound system so I can host team-review sessions remotely.  While writing my thesis I overlooked two phone-bill payments, resulting in a brief credit delay; the matter was settled and my score has improved steadily.  I earn 2 600 € net, own my apartment, have no other loans, and share custody of my 5-year-old niece, my only dependent.  My savings book holds 85 €, hence I seek your support.  The proposed monthly payment of 130 € fits easily within my budget and my employment contract runs until 2026.  I appreciate your consideration and assure you of my full commitment to timely repayment.

Kind regards,  
Felix Hoffmann

Dear Lending Team,  
I am writing as Niklas Braun, 26-year-old single officer (first lieutenant) stationed near my hometown where I have lived in my own terraced house for the last two years.  I need 4 463 € to install a rugged communications radio and smart-screen in my home office, allowing secure briefings when base equipment is unavailable.  During officer training I once missed two installments on a small loan due to field exercises; the arrears were paid immediately and my record has been spotless for 34 months.  My military salary is 2 750 € net, I own no property beyond my 2020 station-wagon, and I have no other debts or dependents.  With only 60 € in my savings account I cannot purchase the equipment outright, yet the 130 € monthly payment equals 4.7 % of my income.  I respectfully request your approval and pledge to honor every obligation on schedule.  Thank you for your service to those who serve.

Yours faithfully,  
Niklas Braun

Dear Credit Reviewers,  
Allow me to introduce Elias Richter, 26, self-employed master carpenter and homeowner.  I am seeking 4 463 € to buy a portable radio/charging-station and a rugged television for on-site client presentations, vital for winning kitchen-renovation contracts.  When I hired my first apprentice two years ago cash-flow tightened and I delayed two loan payments; the balance was cleared and I have since maintained perfect standing.  My monthly profit averages 3 100 €, I possess no assets beyond my 2021 van, and I support my 6-year-old nephew, my only dependent.  My passbook shows 90 €, insufficient for the purchase, yet the 130 € installment is only 4.2 % of my net earnings.  I have been living at the same address for 24 months, hold no other credits at your bank, and am reachable by phone anytime.  I would be grateful for your trust and will meet every deadline with the same precision I bring to my craft.

With appreciation,  
Elias Richter
