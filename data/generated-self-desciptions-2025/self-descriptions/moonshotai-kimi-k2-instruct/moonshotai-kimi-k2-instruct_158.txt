Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 1 288 DM to replace the leaking roof on the house I have owned for four years. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn because I settled last month’s supplier invoices for my carpentry business, but I have no arrears on any credit. I have worked as a master carpenter at StadtBau GmbH for eight years and my salary covers the proposed 3 % installment easily. My savings book holds 420 DM and my property is debt-free; my brother has agreed to guarantee the loan. I have never missed a payment on the two existing credits I hold with you. Two children live with me; their security is my first priority, so I borrow only what I can repay. I respectfully ask for your approval and thank you in advance.  
Sincerely,  
Martin Lechner

Dear Loan Review Team,  
Please allow me 1 288 DM to renew the heating pipes in my 1960s bungalow. After paying medical bills for my younger son my checking account shows a small debit, yet my 470 DM savings and my guarantor, my sister, remain untouched. I have served as senior lab technician at ChemTech for nine years and my net income is 2 600 DM. The 3 % installment equals 38.64 DM—less than my monthly bus pass. I have lived at the same address for four years, own the house outright and have no other loans except the two long-standing credits with your bank, both serviced on time. I am 48, single, and determined to keep my home safe for my two dependents. Kindly grant the loan; I stand ready to sign today.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Klaus Hartmann

Dear Credit Manager,  
I request 1 288 DM to repair the storm-damaged façade of my residence. My checking balance is negative because I just paid the annual property tax, but my savings account shows 350 DM and my best friend has offered to act as guarantor. I have been a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for exactly seven years, earning a secure salary. The monthly repayment of 38.64 DM represents 3 % of the loan and fits easily within my budget. I have owned the house for four years, have no other installment plans, and have never defaulted on the two credits I already hold with your bank. At 48 I support two teenagers alone; maintaining their home is essential. I would be grateful for your swift approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Markus Förster

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing to obtain 1 288 DM for urgent electrical rewiring in my home. My checking account is slightly overdrawn after purchasing materials for last month’s side job, but my savings passbook holds 480 DM and my cousin will guarantee the loan. I have worked as a police sergeant in the city force for ten years, providing stable income. The 3 % installment amounts to 38.64 DM, barely 1.5 % of my net salary. I have lived in my own house for four years, have no other debts beyond the two existing credits with your institution—both serviced promptly—and I am 48 years old with two school-age children depending on me. I respectfully request your consent so I can complete the repairs before winter. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Thomas Richter

Dear Lending Department,  
Please approve 1 288 DM so I can replace the broken boiler and radiators in my house. My checking account shows a small debit because I recently prepaid my sons’ school fees, yet my savings balance is 310 DM and my elder brother stands as guarantor. I have been employed as senior aircraft mechanic at AirService Maintenance for eight years with uninterrupted income. The proposed 3 % installment is 38.64 DM, a sum I have budgeted for. I have resided in my own home for four years, possess no other installment obligations, and have maintained perfect payment records on the two existing credits I hold with your bank. At 48 I am single and solely responsible for two dependents; keeping the house warm is non-negotiable. I thank you for your trust and await your positive reply.  
Best regards,  
Michael Adler
