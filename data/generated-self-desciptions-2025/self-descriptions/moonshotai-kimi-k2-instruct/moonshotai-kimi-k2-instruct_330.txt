Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aldo Martínez, 31, a single father and quality-control chemist at Bayer Leverkusen since August 2016. I earn €3,100 net and have held the same account with you for five years, always in credit by at least €250. I have paid every installment of my 2019 car loan on time and closed it last month. I now need €4,473 to replace our broken television and radio—my 8-year-old daughter uses them daily for school podcasts. My only asset besides the car is my small row-house; savings are €60. No other debts, no guarantors, and I have never missed a payment. A 36-month loan at 4 % of income (€124/month) leaves me €1,300 for living costs, more than enough. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Aldo Martínez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petru Ionescu, 31, Romanian CNC operator at BMW Leipzig since 2015. My checking account has carried €220+ for four years; my previous €5,500 loan was paid off last year without a single delay. I am applying for €4,473 to buy my sister a television and pocket-radio for her university dorm. I have worked at the same plant for nine years, earn €2,950 net, and live alone in my own apartment. Savings: €85. No other loans, no dependents besides the monthly support I send home. The requested installment of €128 fits easily within the 4 % rule. I have been at my present address for two years and can be reached through the HR office. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully,  
Petru Ionescu

Dear Team,  
My name is Jacek Nowak, 31, Polish national and senior electrical technician at Siemens Energy Hamburg. I have been employed since 2014 and paid my 2020 kitchen-loan faithfully; it finished this January. I urgently need €4,473 for a television and short-wave radio so I can follow Polish news and keep my English skills current—both essential for my upcoming promotion exam. My account balance has stayed above €200 for six years; savings are only €70 because I used most funds to renovate my apartment, which I own. No debts, no co-signers, one child whom I support. The monthly burden of €126 over 36 months equals 3.9 % of my €3,200 net salary. I have lived in the same flat for two years and can provide employer confirmation at any time. Please approve the loan.  
Best regards,  
Jacek Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Viktor Lakatos, 31, Hungarian master welder at Daimler Trucks Mannheim since 2013. My payroll account has never dropped below €300 in the past year; my 2018 personal loan was repaid early with all interest. I request €4,473 to purchase a smart television and stereo system—my mother’s only wish for her retirement gift. Gross monthly income €4,050, net €2,980. Savings account shows €45, but I own my apartment and car outright. No other credits, no guarantors, single with one dependent child. The proposed installment of €129 is 4.3 % of net income, well within your guideline. I have resided at my current address for two years and can be contacted through the plant secretary. I appreciate your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Viktor Lakatos

Dear Madam,  
My name is Luka Perić, 31, Croatian toolmaker at Audi Neckarsulm since 2012. My checking balance averages €250; I concluded my 2019 holiday loan last month with zero arrears. I seek €4,473 for a television and DAB-radio so my elderly parents can receive Croatian programs when they visit me each summer. Net salary €3,050, savings €55, property: own apartment and a 2016 VW Golf. No other installment plans, no co-debtors, one daughter. The 36-month loan at €127 monthly equals 4.16 % of income, leaving ample margin. I have lived at the same address for two years and receive all statements at the works council office. Thank you for your favorable consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Luka Perić
