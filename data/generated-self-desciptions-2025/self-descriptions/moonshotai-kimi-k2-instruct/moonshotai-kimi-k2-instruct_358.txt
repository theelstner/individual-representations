Letter 1 – Mr. Carlos Mendoza, Satellite-TV Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 2,331 € to replace the test-equipment van that was stolen last month; without a spectrum analyser I cannot calibrate the new apartment complex’s communal antenna system and the contract penalty is 150 € per day. For twelve months I have banked only with the post-office giro, yet every utility bill has been paid on the 28th without fail. I have worked as a certified satellite technician for eight years and my 16-year-old son and I live in the small house we inherited; the deed is debt-free and my ex-wife has agreed to sign as co-applicant. My wage is 1,950 € net and the requested instalment of 195 € leaves 1,755 € for living costs—well above the 1,200 € the youth-court sets as minimum support. There are no other loans, only the existing 3,000 € credit line with you that has never been overdrawn. I have attached the police report, the employer’s confirmation of overtime availability, and the property registry extract. Thank you for considering this modest, one-time request.  
Respectfully, Carlos Mendoza  

Letter 2 – Mr. Dieter Huber, Municipal Archivist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
The 2,331 € I ask for will buy the 77-inch public-display screen required by the city council for the 650-year anniversary exhibition; failure to provide it by 30 September would forfeit the 4,000 € honorarium my small firm has already budgeted. Though my checking account was opened only last year, my salary as a Beamter has arrived unchanged since 2013—eleven years of secure income. I own the apartment outright; my sister, co-applicant, is a primary-school headmistress. The monthly payment of 195 € equals one twelfth of my net salary, and savings already reserved for the screen will stay untouched as collateral. My single existing credit with your bank is ahead of schedule. Please find the council’s purchase order and the land-registry excerpt. I would be pleased to supply any further information.  
Sincerely, Dieter Huber  

Letter 3 – Mr. Luis da Silva, Tramway Maintenance Inspector  
Dear Credit Committee,  
After twelve months of nightly shifts I finally saved enough to move my daughter and mother from our rented flat into a modest row-house we already own; the 2,331 € will complete the living-room furnishing so the social-services inspection due on 15 October will approve the guardianship transfer. My pay-slip shows 2,040 € net since 2011—thirteen consecutive years with the transport authority. My cousin, a station supervisor, joins the application as guarantor. The debit of 195 € per month is exactly the amount I have been setting aside in cash; once the loan is granted I will simply redirect that sum to you. My only other obligation is the small current credit with your institution, serviced without delay. Enclosed are the guardianship-court letter, employment certificate, and property deed. Thank you for helping me give my family stability.  
Yours faithfully, Luis da Silva  

Letter 4 – Mr. Marek Novak, Brewery Quality Controller  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I need 2,331 € to purchase a professional colour-calibration kit for the new smart-television that will stream training videos to forty seasonal workers; the brewery’s quality manager has made the upgrade conditional on my equipment certificate. Although I opened my first checking account only last year, my wages have entered the same bank on the 15th of every month since 2009—fifteen years. My brother, a senior brewer, stands as co-applicant. The monthly debit of 195 € represents 9 % of my net income; my debt-free house secures the loan, and my single existing credit with you carries zero arrears. I enclose the employer’s memo, payroll slips, and land-registry printout. Your approval will allow me to keep the training schedule intact and the brewery’s quality standards high.  
Gratefully, Marek Novak  

Letter 5 – Mr. Jean-Claude Dubois, Forensic Imaging Specialist  
Dear Banking Team,  
The 2,331 € requested will fund a broadcast-grade monitor essential for presenting high-definition evidence in next month’s fraud trial; losing this contract would cost my one-man practice 6,000 €. My account history may be only twelve months old, yet my salary as a police-scientific civil servant has been steady since 2010—fourteen years. My partner, a court stenographer, signs jointly. The 195 € monthly instalment equals the pension contribution I already pay voluntarily, proving disposable income exists. I possess the apartment without mortgage, hold no other loans besides the current credit with your bank that I service punctually. Attached are the court summons, income statement, and property deed. I thank you for your consideration and remain available for any clarification.  
Respectfully yours, Jean-Claude Dubois
