Letter 1 – Elena Petrova, Lab Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 29-year-old Russian national and divorced mother of one. For the past three years I have worked as a scientific-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Potsdam, earning €1,950 net. My divorce was finalized six months ago; I therefore have no checking account yet, only a savings book with €85. I have, however, repaid my first bank loan (€2,000 for household appliances) on time every month and own the small one-bedroom apartment outright, so my housing costs are only the utility bills. I am requesting €518 to replace our broken television—my 6-year-old daughter uses it for school language programmes. With no other debts and a disposable income of €630, the proposed €18 monthly instalment equals 3 % of my net salary and is easily covered. I enclose my employment contract, last three pay-slips and the land-registry excerpt. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova  

Letter 2 – Aisha Benali, Radiology Nurse  
Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Aisha Benali, 29, Tunisian, married and living in Bremen since last year. I work as a radiology nurse at St.-Joseph-Hospital, employed continuously since February 2021. Although I have no checking account yet, I have kept my first consumer loan (€1,200 for furniture) current for 24 months; the balance is now €310. My savings balance is €60. We own our 42 m² flat free of mortgage. I need €518 to buy a television so my husband, who is still in Tunisia awaiting his visa, can follow German courses online with me. The monthly payment of €18 represents 2.8 % of my €1,740 net salary and leaves enough room for my dependent husband and my living costs. I attach my unlimited employment contract, last three salary statements and the condominium ownership deed. I would be grateful for your favourable reply.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Benali  

Letter 3 – Lina Morales, CNC Machinist  
Dear Team,  
I am Lina Morales, 29, from Colombia, separated and residing in my own row-house in Dortmund since January. I have worked as a CNC machinist at Westfalen-Metall for 28 months, currently earning €2,100 net. My only savings are €70 in a passbook; I have no checking account because I salary-cash my wages. My first loan—€1,500 for tools—has been repaid punctually for 18 months; remaining balance €420. I am requesting €518 to purchase a radio-television set for my 8-year-old son’s homework and for my integration classes. The €18 monthly instalment equals 3 % of my income and is the only fixed liability besides utilities. I enclose my employment reference, residence registration and land-registry proof of ownership. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Lina Morales  

Letter 4 – Samira El Sayed, Pharmacy Official  
Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Samira El Sayed, 29, Egyptian, divorced and mother of a 5-year-old daughter. I have served as a certified pharmacy official at Charité Berlin since May 2021. Although I have no checking account, I have maintained my initial €1,800 loan (used for relocation) impeccably; only €380 remain. My savings account holds €95. I own my 38 m² apartment outright. I apply for €518 to replace our defective television that my daughter needs for kindergarten learning videos. The proposed instalment of €18 constitutes 3 % of my €1,870 net salary and is easily serviceable alongside our living costs. I forward my civil-servant contract, last three salary slips and property deed. I appreciate your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira El Sayed  

Letter 5 – Anh Vu, Skilled Electrician  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am Anh Vu, 29, Vietnamese, married but living separately from my husband since last year. I have been a skilled electrician at Hamburg Shipyard for 32 months, with a net wage of €2,050. I possess no checking account yet; my savings are €90. My first loan of €1,600 (taken for work tools) has been repaid duly; remaining balance €350. I am seeking €518 to buy a television so I can follow evening technical courses broadcast by the chamber of crafts. The monthly €18 payment represents 3 % of my income and is my only financial obligation besides rent-free living in my own 1-room flat. I attach my employment certificate, residence registration and land-registry extract. Thank you for your support.  
Kind regards,  
Anh Vu
