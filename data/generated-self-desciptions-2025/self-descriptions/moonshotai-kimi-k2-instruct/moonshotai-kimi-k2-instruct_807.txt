Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Franz Müller, 24, a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig since 2016 (5 yrs 8 mos). I need 9 271 DM to replace my 1993 Polo with a new Skoda Fabia so I can reach the night-shift bus no longer stops for. My net salary is 2 050 DM; rent-free own house inherited from my mother keeps expenses low. My only current loan—4 000 DM for furniture—has been paid on time every month since 2018. Checking balance is –120 DM because I just settled semester fees for my sister (dependent). I save 100 DM monthly; savings book shows 95 DM. No other debts, no guarantors. I have lived at Dresdner Str. 12 for 13 months and can be reached at 0341-555-7842. A 36-month loan at 2 % installment (258 DM/month) fits easily into my budget. I have always honoured my obligations and will continue to do so.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Yusuf Demir, 24, single father of a 3-year-old daughter. Since March 2017 I have worked as a CNC operator at AutoParts Stuttgart (4 yrs 9 mos). I am requesting 9 271 DM to buy a new Dacia Sandero: my 1991 Golf died last week and daycare is 18 km away. My net wage is 2 180 DM; I own my small apartment (no rent). My checking account shows –60 DM after buying toddler winter clothes; savings account holds 80 DM. My only existing credit—5 500 DM for home insulation—has been repaid punctually since 2019. No other loans, no co-signers. I have resided at Neckarstr. 7 for 14 months and my phone is 0711-444-9981. The proposed 36-month term (258 DM/month, 2 % rate) equals 11 % of income, well within safe margins. I stand by my word and ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Yusuf Demir

Dear Team,  
I am Lukas Huber, 24, a certified electrician employed by EnergieWerk Innsbruck since May 2015 (6 yrs 4 mos). I seek 9 271 DM to purchase a new VW Up!; my current motorcycle is unsafe for alpine winters. My net income is 2 120 DM; I live cost-free in my late grandmother’s house which I inherited. Checking balance is –45 DM after paying vehicle registration fees; savings passbook shows 70 DM. My running 6 000 DM home-renovation loan has never been late since 2017. No other debts, no dependents besides my dog. I have lived at Hochstraße 9 for 12 months and am reachable at 0512-666-3215. A 36-month loan at 258 DM/month (2 % installment) represents 12 % of my salary, a ratio I can comfortably meet. My credit record speaks for itself, and I commit to keeping it spotless.  
Best regards,  
Lukas Huber

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Petru Lăzărescu, 24, a refrigeration technician at Kältebau Hamburg since April 2016 (5 yrs 7 mos). I apply for 9 271 DM to finance a new Hyundai i10; my 1990 Kadett was written off after an accident and I must commute to construction sites. My take-home pay is 2 040 DM; I own my small terraced house (no rent). Checking account is –80 DM after settling hospital bill; savings account holds 60 DM. My current 4 500 DM loan for tools has been repaid flawlessly since 2018. No other obligations, no co-debtors. I have resided at Elbstr. 15 for 15 months and my telephone is 040-777-5553. The requested 36-month term (258 DM/month, 2 % rate) equals 12.6 % of income, well below the 20 % guideline. Honesty and punctuality are my principles; I will service this loan the same way.  
Respectfully,  
Petru Lăzărescu

Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am Niklas Berg, 24, a railway signal technician employed by Deutsche Bahn AG since August 2014 (6 yrs 10 mos). I request 9 271 DM to buy a new Seat Ibiza; my 1989 Jetta no longer meets emission standards for my 60 km daily commute. My net salary is 2 200 DM; I live rent-free in my deceased parents’ house which I own. Checking balance is –95 DM after paying municipal tax; savings book shows 85 DM. My existing 5 000 DM loan for a heating system has been paid on time every month since 2018. No other debts, no guarantors. I have lived at Bahnhofstr. 4 for 16 months and can be reached at 030-888-2468. The 36-month loan (258 DM/month, 2 % installment) accounts for 11.7 % of my income, leaving ample room for living costs and my 5-year-old nephew whom I support. My credit history is clean and I intend to keep it that way.  
Yours faithfully,  
Niklas Berg
