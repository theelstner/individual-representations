Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 31-year-old Bulgarian lab technician who has lived in Cologne for 15 months. I need 1,532 € to finish the second year of my part-time biotechnology certificate at the Technical College; without the final modules I cannot sit for the state exam that would raise my salary from 2,050 € to 2,700 € net. I have worked at WestLab GmbH for three years and my contract is open-ended. My only car, a 2015 Opel Corsa, is fully paid; my housing costs are 280 € per month because I own a small studio apartment. I have no other loans, no co-signer, and no checking account—only a savings book with 380 € that I built by setting aside 50 € each month. I have never missed rent or utility payments, and my Schufa report shows only one old telecom bill that I am clearing at 25 € per month. I ask for 36 monthly installments of 44 €; this equals 4 % of my net income, well within my budget. Completing the certificate will secure my job and allow me to support my eight-year-old daughter without state aid. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Laila Ben Kacem, 31, Tunisian, divorced, and mother of a six-year-old boy. After 15 months in Hamburg I wish to borrow 1,532 € to pay the final semester of my German-as-a-Foreign-Language teaching diploma at the university’s evening college; without the certificate I cannot move from classroom aide (1,900 € net) to certified teacher (2,800 € net). I have been employed as a bilingual secretary at the Arab-German Cultural Center since January 2021 on a permanent contract. I live in my own one-bedroom co-op flat; housing charges are 230 €. My only vehicle is a 2014 Ford Fiesta. Savings: 420 € in a postal savings book. No other loans, no guarantors, no telephone landline. I propose to repay 44 € monthly over 36 months—4 % of my salary—while continuing to cover all living costs for my son and myself. The diploma will guarantee my position and end our reliance on child-benefit supplements. I have always paid rent, kindergarten fees, and health insurance on time and I am prepared to provide proof. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Laila Ben Kacem

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Mariana Silva, Brazilian, 31, married to a German national, and we have a four-year-old daughter. I have resided in Frankfurt for 15 months and need 1,532 € to cover tuition and examination fees for the final year of my European Banking Certificate program; passing it will convert my current 2,100 € net teller job into a 2,900 € net junior credit-analyst role at Sparkasse Mitte, where I have been employed since March 2021. We own our small row house; the mortgage is paid by my husband, so my only housing cost is utilities. My 2013 VW Polo is debt-free. I keep 450 € in a savings account and have no other installment plans or co-debtors. I respectfully request repayment over 36 months at 44 € per month—exactly 4 % of my present income. My Schufa entry lists one settled phone debt from 2022; since then every energy and insurance bill has been paid promptly. The promotion will secure my residence permit and family income. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Mariana Silva

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Ivana Horvat, 31, Croatian, separated, and mother of a seven-year-old boy. I have lived in Stuttgart for 15 months and apply for 1,532 € to finish the third semester of my Accounting & Controlling night course; the degree is required for me to advance from bookkeeping clerk (2,000 € net) to certified accountant (2,750 € net) at the Swabian Craftsmen’s Association, where I have held a permanent post since February 2021. I own a 55 m² apartment acquired through a cooperative; monthly running costs 250 €. My car is a 2012 Renault Twingo, fully paid. Savings balance: 350 €. No other credits, no guarantors, no telephone at home. I offer to service the loan at 44 € monthly over 36 months, representing 4 % of my net wage. My only negative Schufa entry is an old electricity account now settled. I have never missed rent or kindergarten fees, and my salary is deposited onto a payroll card. The promotion will allow me to support my son unaided and build a modest emergency fund. I thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Ivana Horvat

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Nura Yıldız, 31, Turkish, divorced, and I have one five-year-old daughter. After 15 months in Munich I request 1,532 € to pay the remaining training fees for the IHK-certified Foreign Trade Specialist course; completion will lift my wage from 2,050 € to 2,800 € net at Bayerische Textil-Importe GmbH, where I have worked as a bilingual sales coordinator since April 2021. I reside in my own 48 m² studio; housing charges 270 €. My 2011 Seat Ibiza is debt-free. I maintain 480 € in a building-society account. No other loans, no co-signer, no landline telephone. I am prepared to repay 44 € per month for 36 months—4 % of my income—while covering childcare and living costs. My Schufa record shows one small unpaid mobile bill from 2021 that I am clearing at 20 € monthly; otherwise all utilities and insurance premiums are current. The certificate secures my work permit extension and a better future for my daughter. Thank you for your support.  
Kind regards,  
Nura Yıldız
