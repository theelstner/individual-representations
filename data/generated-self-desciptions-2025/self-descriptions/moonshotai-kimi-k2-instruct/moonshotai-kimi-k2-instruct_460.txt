Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, 27, a Ukrainian lab technician at Dresden University Hospital since last October. I rent a 38 m² city flat but I own the small house in my home village which my grandmother left me; it is debt-free and rented out for 250 €/month. I need 343 € to replace my broken refrigerator and induction hob so that I can cook fresh meals for my five-year-old daughter. My net salary is 1 480 € and my only outgoing is 200 € for the ongoing car loan, always paid on the 15th. With 90 € in savings and no other debts I can easily add the 52 € monthly installment. The property deed is attached as additional security. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Layla Al-Hassan, Syrian micro-biology research assistant at Cologne’s Max-Planck-Institute, employed since 1 January. My divorce was finalised last month; I now live alone with my toddler in my own 42 m² apartment (mortgage-free, gift from my parents). My checking account is currently 45 € overdrawn and my savings book holds 85 €. I apply for 343 € to buy a quiet washing machine because night-time laundrette trips with a child are unsafe. My net wage is 1 550 €, my current bank loan costs 200 € monthly and is always paid on time; the new 52 € installment fits the 4 % rate. No guarantor is needed—my home is unencumbered real estate. I appreciate your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Layla Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
I am Marija Nikolić, 27, Serbian national, employed as senior radiology nurse at Stuttgart Clinic since 1 December. I separated amicably last year; my three-year-old son and I live in our own 55 m² row house (no mortgage). My checking balance is –30 € and savings 70 €. I request 343 € to purchase an energy-efficient cooker and oven; the old unit short-circuited. My salary is 1 520 € net, my running loan payment is 200 € monthly and never missed. The proposed 52 € installment equals 3.4 % of income, well below the 4 % limit. The property deed is at your disposal as additional collateral. Thank you for helping us cook safely.  
Best regards,  
Marija Nikolić

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Elena Rossi, Italian skilled machinist at BMW Leipzig since 15 November. Although newly divorced, I retain sole ownership of our 48 m² flat (no encumbrances). My account is 60 € overdrawn and savings stand at 95 €. I seek 343 € to buy a dishwasher and induction hob so I can maintain hygiene for my asthmatic six-year-old daughter. My net wage is 1 460 €; my current loan repayment is 200 € monthly and always punctual. The additional 52 € installment fits the 4 % rule. No other debts or guarantors exist, and the real-estate title deed is offered as further security. I kindly ask for approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Elena Rossi
