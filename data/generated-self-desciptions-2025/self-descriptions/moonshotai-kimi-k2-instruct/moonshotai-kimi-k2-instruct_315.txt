Letter 1 – Mr. Luis Ortega, warehouse picker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 25, married, and have worked for the past six years in the refrigerated warehouse of FrischeLogistik GmbH. My wife and I just bought a small row-house on the outskirts and our first child is due in September. My current account shows 170 DM and I have 85 DM in savings; the only loan I have ever taken was for our furniture and it was paid off last month without a single late transfer. I need 685 DM to close the gap for a new 1.1 l Opel Corsa so I can accept the early-shift that starts at 04:30 h; the shift premium will add 120 DM net each month. The instalment you require is only 2 % of my 1,050 DM net wage, well below the 35 DM monthly payment. My residence permit is valid until 1992 and my employment contract is unlimited. I respectfully ask you to approve the loan; I have always fulfilled my obligations and I will continue to do so.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Mr. Petar Ivanov, hospital porter  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Petar Ivanov, I am 25, married, and I have pushed meal carts through St. Hedwig Hospital since 1983. After 5½ years of uninterrupted service I now earn 1,140 DM net. We live in our own small terraced house and keep 90 DM in our savings book. My checking balance is presently 150 DM. I have never missed a payment on the 450 DM consumer loan I took for our washing machine; it will be cleared this December. I apply for 685 DM to buy the new Dacia 1300 that the dealer is holding until 30 June; the car will let me take the better-paid night-porter position that requires reliable transport. The monthly burden would be 34 DM, exactly 2 % of my income, and I have no other dependents except my wife. I have been at the same address for three years and my work permit runs until 1991. You can count on my signature as on my shift schedule – always on time.  
Respectfully,  
Petar Ivanov  

Letter 3 – Mr. Andrzej Nowak, brewery bottling-line worker  
Esteemed Bank Team,  
I am Andrzej Nowak, 25, married, and for the last 4 years I have worked full-time on the bottling line of Berliner Nordbrauerei. My wages are 1,080 DM net, my wife is expecting our child, and we own the small semi-detached house we bought last year. My checking account holds 180 DM and my savings passbook 70 DM. I have just finished paying off the 350 DM loan for our kitchen stove; every instalment was transferred on the 15th without exception. I request 685 DM to add to the cash I saved for a new VW Polo so I can drive to the night shift that pays 150 DM extra per month. The proposed 34 DM monthly payment equals 2 % of my income and is the only instalment I would carry. I have lived at the same address since 1985 and my residence permit is valid until 1993. I stand by my word and will honour this obligation as faithfully as I keep the bottling line running.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andrzej Nowak  

Letter 4 – Mr. Hassan Farouk, municipal street-cleaner  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
My name is Hassan Farouk, I am 25, married, and I have swept and operated the leaf-collecting machine for Bezirk Tempelhof since 1984. My net income is 1,020 DM and I have never been unemployed. My wife and I own our modest flat; my checking balance is 160 DM and I keep 60 DM in savings. I concluded one previous loan of 500 DM for our refrigerator; it was paid off this February with every cent on the due date. I now seek 685 DM to purchase the new Fiat Uno that will allow me to accept the supervisor position that starts in August and carries a 130 DM monthly raise. The loan instalment of 34 DM represents 2 % of my wage and fits easily into our budget. I have lived in the same apartment for three years and my residence status is secure until 1992. I give you my word that the payments will arrive as regularly as my street-cleaning shift.  
With respect,  
Hassan Farouk  

Letter 5 – Mr. Nikolaos Kostas, hotel dishwasher  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am Nikolaos Kostas, 25, married, and I have worked as a dishwasher in the Grand City Hotel for 5 years and 3 months, earning 990 DM net. My wife is pregnant with our first child and we have just moved into our own small apartment. My checking account shows 190 DM and my savings booklet 95 DM. I have successfully repaid a 400 DM loan for our bed; the last debit was made this April, always on time. I apply for 685 DM to complete the purchase of a new Citroën AX which I need to reach the hotel’s second location where I will receive 140 DM extra per month. The monthly payment of 33 DM equals 2 % of my income and is the only obligation I would carry. I have resided at the same address since 1986 and my work permit is valid until 1991. I have never broken a promise and I will not start with your bank.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Nikolaos Kostas
