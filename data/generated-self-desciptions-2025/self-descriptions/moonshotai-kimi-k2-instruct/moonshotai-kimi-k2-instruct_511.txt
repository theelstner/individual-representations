Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Lars Meissner, 45, senior research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research. After 8½ years of continuous employment I need €8,588 to replace my 2005 VW Golf with a 2018 Skoda Octavia so I can drive to the synchrotron in Hamburg twice a week. My net salary is €3,400 and my only dependent is my 12-year-old son Tim. I have paid every previous loan on the exact due date, have no other debts, and keep €420 in my savings book. The car I am buying will itself serve as additional collateral. I am single, own my apartment outright, and have lived at the same address for two years. A telephone is registered in my name. I respectfully ask for your approval so my work on biodegradable packaging can continue without interruption.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Lars Meissner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Nowak, 45, self-employed master carpenter running “Nowak Holzbau” for the past 9 years. My annual taxable income averages €38,000. I apply for €8,588 to purchase a 2017 Ford Transit Custom that will let me deliver custom staircases to clients. I have repaid my only previous bank loan early, hold €480 in savings, and have no other obligations. Living alone in my own house and caring for my elderly father (one dependent), I offer the van as security. I have resided at Friedhofstraße 14 since 2022 and a landline is listed under my name. The monthly installment of €343 represents 11 % of my steady income. I guarantee punctual payment and remain at your disposal for any further information.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Team,  
My name is Daniel Kübler, 45, police chief inspector serving the city of Regensburg for 8 years and 3 months. I request €8,588 to buy a 2016 BMW 318i that will replace my current patrol-duty vehicle for private use. My civil-servant salary is €3,550 net, my housing is owner-occupied, and I support my 15-year-old daughter Mia. Savings of €460 are on deposit, no other loans or guarantors exist, and my sole previous credit with you was settled without delay. I have lived in my present flat for two years and a telephone is registered to me. The proposed 48-month installment equals 4 % of my income, well within the 20 % limit for public servants. I appreciate your consideration and assure full adherence to the repayment schedule.  
Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Kübler
