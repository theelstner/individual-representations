Letter 1 – Luis Ortega, Warehouse Picker  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I moved from Valencia to Düsseldorf 24 months ago and have worked since then as a warehouse picker for FreshFoods GmbH. After 2 years and 7 months on the job I earn 1 950 € net and live rent-free in the small single-family house I inherited; the land-registry value is 165 000 €. I need 2 684 € to replace our broken television and the old radio my 8-year-old son uses for school listening exercises. My only other debt is 1 100 € remaining on a car loan with Sparkasse Köln; both installments together equal 4 % of my income. My payroll account will be opened at your bank next week; I have saved 85 € so far. I have never missed a payment in 32 monthly installments elsewhere and the property guarantees additional security. Please approve the loan; I will repay 112 € monthly over 24 months. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely, Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Dmitri Petrov, Hospital Porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a Russian national working as a porter in St.-Franziskus Hospital since 1 year 9 months and I permanently reside in my own apartment in Dortmund since 24 months. I ask for 2 684 € to buy a television and a digital receiver so that my elderly mother, who lives with me, can watch programs in Russian and ease her homesickness. My net wage is 1 740 €; I own a 55 m² condominium free of mortgage, valued at 120 000 €. Savings stand at 90 €. I already service two small credits elsewhere (total 130 € monthly) and the new installment of 112 € would keep my debt-to-income ratio at 4 %. I have never been overdrawn and the property can be noted as contingent collateral. I respectfully request approval.  
Respectfully yours, Dmitri Petrov  

Letter 3 – Abdullah Cevik, Parcel Sorter  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
For the past 3 years and 2 months I have sorted parcels for DHL night shift and earn 1 830 € net. I have lived in my own terraced house in Oberhausen since 24 months; its tax value is 140 000 €. I apply for 2 684 € to purchase a television and a stereo system so my 10-year-old daughter can watch educational programs and improve her German. My savings book shows 70 €. I currently pay 95 € monthly for an old phone debt; the new loan would raise total installments to 4 % of income. I possess no checking account yet but will open one with you immediately. I have never missed a payment since arriving from Turkey and offer my home as silent security. I promise prompt repayment and thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully, Abdullah Cevik  

Letter 4 – Nicolae Ionescu, Janitor  
To Whom It May Concern,  
I am a Romanian citizen working as a janitor for an apartment cooperative since 2 years 5 months, with a net salary of 1 680 €. I have owned a small bungalow in Mülheim since 24 months worth 110 000 €. I seek 2 684 € to replace our defective television and radio, the only entertainment for my 6-year-old daughter. My savings account holds 65 €. I have two running credits elsewhere totaling 110 € monthly; your loan would add 112 €, keeping the overall rate at 4 % of income. No other parties are liable. I have no telephone but I am reachable through my employer. I have always paid on time and pledge my property as fallback collateral. I kindly ask for approval.  
Respectfully, Nicolae Ionescu  

Letter 5 – Hassan Farah, Cleaner  
Dear Lending Department,  
I am a Somali national working as a cleaner for the City of Hamburg since 1 year 11 months, earning 1 770 € net. I have lived in my own 45 m² flat in Wilhelmsburg since 24 months; its market value is 95 000 €. I request 2 684 € to buy a television so my 12-year-old son can follow school media assignments. I have saved 80 € in cash. I currently repay 100 € monthly for furniture credit; the new loan would raise total installments to 4 % of my income. I have no other dependents or guarantors.
