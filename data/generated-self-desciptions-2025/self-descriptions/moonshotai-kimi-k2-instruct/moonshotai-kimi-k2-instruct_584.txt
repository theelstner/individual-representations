Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ana Petrova, a 26-year-old Ukrainian laboratory technician who has been renting a small flat in Munich for the past two years. Since my divorce last year I raise my four-year-old son alone; he sleeps on a mattress on the floor because I have not been able to afford proper beds. I therefore request a loan of 1,388 € to buy bunk beds, a table and a cooker. I have worked for the Max-Planck-Institute for the past three years, earning 1,750 € net per month. My only existing credit with your bank—250 € for a washing machine—has been paid on time every month for nine months. Although my savings are still below 100 €, my employment contract is unlimited and my salary covers the 4 % installment comfortably. The apartment building belongs to my parents; I have lifetime tenancy, so my housing cost is stable and low. No other debts or guarantors encumber me. I have registered residence here since May 2022 and have never missed a payment on any bill. I respectfully ask for your support so that my son and I can live with dignity while I continue to build a secure future for us. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Leila Çelik, I am 26, Turkish, and I have been living in Frankfurt for two years after separating from my husband. I work as a certified dental assistant at the Praxis am Hauptbahnhof since October 2021. My gross salary is 2,100 €, and my rent is 520 €. I need 1,388 € to buy a sturdy twin bed, a wardrobe and a kitchen stove so that my five-year-old daughter and I no longer share one sofa. I have had one previous loan with your bank—500 € for a laptop—which I have repaid faithfully every month for nine months. My savings account currently holds 70 €, but my job is secure and my employment contract runs until 2026. I have no other debts or co-signers, and the monthly installment of 55 € equals 4 % of my net income, well within my budget. Although I do not yet have a checking account with you, my salary is paid into a German bank and I can arrange direct debit immediately. I have lived at the same address since July 2022 and am registered with the city. I would be grateful for your trust and remain committed to repaying the loan on schedule.  

Respectfully,  
Leila Çelik

Dear Lending Team,  

I am writing as Marta Rodriguez, 26, a Peruvian electronics technician employed at Siemens AG in Nuremberg since January 2021. After my divorce I moved into a rented flat where I now need basic furniture: a bed, a desk and a refrigerator, totaling 1,388 €. I have repaid my first small loan of 300 € for a used bicycle without delay for nine months. My net income is 1,900 €, rent 600 €, and the proposed monthly payment of 76 € fits easily within the 4 % installment limit. My savings are 85 € at present, but my employment is permanent and my residence permit is valid until 2027. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no dependents besides myself. I have been registered at my current address since August 2022. Although I do not yet hold a checking account with your bank, I am prepared to open one and to set up automatic transfer. I respectfully request your approval so I can furnish my home and continue rebuilding my life responsibly.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Marta Rodriguez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ekaterina Volkova, I am 26 years old, Russian, and I have been living and working in Stuttgart since my marriage ended two years ago. I am a trained pastry chef at the Bäckerei Kuhn GmbH, employed there since March 2021. I am applying for 1,388 € to purchase a bed, a dining table and a washing machine so that my three-year-old daughter and I can move out of temporary furnished accommodation into our own rented flat. I have already repaid a 400 € loan taken last December for a stroller, with nine punctual monthly payments. My net wage is 1,650 €, rent will be 550 €, and the monthly installment of 66 € represents exactly 4 % of my disposable income. My savings are 60 €, but my contract is unlimited and my residence is registered since June 2022. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no further installment plans. I do not yet have a checking account with your bank but am ready to open one immediately. I would be grateful for your support in creating a stable home for my child while maintaining my impeccable repayment record.  

Yours faithfully,  
Ekaterina Volkova

Dear Loan Department,  

I am Nguyen Thi Lan, a 26-year-old Vietnamese laboratory chemist working at Bayer CropScience in Cologne since February 2021. After separating from my husband I continue to live in our rented apartment, but I lack essential furniture: a bed, a bookshelf and a cooker, for which I need 1,388 €. I have successfully repaid a 350 € loan for a laptop over the past nine months and have never missed a payment. My monthly net salary is 1,800 €, my rent 500 €, and the proposed installment of 72 € equals 4 % of my net income. My savings account balance is 90 €, yet my employment contract is open-ended and my residence permit is valid until 2028. I have no other credits, no co-signers, and one dependent—my four-year-old son. I have been registered at my current address since July 2022. Although I do not yet maintain a checking account with your bank, I am prepared to transfer my salary domicile to you and to authorize direct debit. I respectfully ask for your trust so that I can complete our home and continue to meet every financial obligation on time.  

Thank you very much.  

Nguyen Thi Lan
