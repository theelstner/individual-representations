Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Elena Petrova, I am 31, a Ukrainian national, and I have lived in Germany for ten months. I work as a junior laboratory technician at BioLab North, hired last July on a two-year contract that pays €1,950 net. Since arriving I have paid every rent and every bill on time; my Schufa shows one small consumer loan (€1,200) that will be finished in February—never missed a payment. I need €2,901 to buy the 2015 VW Polo I already inspected; it will cut my 90-minute commute to 25 minutes and let me collect my six-year-old daughter from kindergarten on time. The car is priced €400 below market, so I am putting the saved money toward the first installment. I rent a 48 m² apartment, own no savings account yet, but I do own a one-bedroom flat in Kyiv that my parents currently occupy; the rental income is sent monthly to my German account and can be documented. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone contract—only the desire to keep showing up reliably at work and to keep building a clean credit record here. I respectfully ask for your trust and for the €2,901 car loan at the 1 % rate offered.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Sincerely,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Aisha Al-Mansouri, 31, divorced mother of one, living in Hamburg since December after leaving the UAE. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University Heart Center since 1 March on a fixed-term contract that is very likely to be renewed; my net salary is €2,140. I have paid back my only existing credit (€1,500 for household goods) punctually every month and Schufa confirms “no delays.” I am asking for €2,901 to purchase a 2013 Opel Corsa that will allow me to drive my four-year-old son to day-care before shift-work starts at 6 a.m.; taxis currently cost €280 a month. I rent a 55 m² flat, have no savings account in Germany yet, but I own a studio apartment in Sharjah that is debt-free and rented out; the remittance slips are available. No other installment plans, no co-debtor, and I have never moved since arriving—same address for four months. The requested loan equals only 1.4 months’ income and the installment rate of 1 % keeps total interest below €30. I am ready to set up a checking account with your bank today and to sign a direct-debit authorization so the payment is always collected on the 25th, the day my salary lands.  
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Al-Mansouri

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Laura Schmidt, 31, separated, Brazilian by birth but now a German permanent resident. I have worked as a certified pharmacy technician at St.-Joseph Apotheke since 15 October last year; my probezeit ended positively in January and my indefinite contract pays €2,300 net. Although I have no checking account with your institute, I have paid my single existing loan (€1,800 for relocation costs) exactly on schedule—Schufa score 97. I am requesting €2,901 to buy a 2014 Seat Ibiza I have already reserved; the dealer will hold it until 20 May. Living in company-provided housing, I pay no rent, but I do own a small inherited house in Brazil that generates €300 monthly rental income, documented by bank statements. No dependents other than my eight-year-old daughter, no other debts, no guarantors. The €2,901 equals 1.26 monthly salaries and the 1 % installment (€24.18) will be transferred automatically the day my wage arrives. I am willing to open a current account immediately and to insure the car comprehensively with your bank as loss-payee.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Laura Schmidt

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Fatima Haddad, 31, divorced, Lebanese, living in Cologne since January. I was hired as a senior radiology IT administrator at Kölner Kliniken on 1 February; my net income is €2,550 and HR has already informed me the contract will be made permanent in August. I have one running credit (€1,300 for household appliances) with perfect repayment history—Schufa entry “current, no arrears.” I need €2,901 to purchase a 2012 Ford Fiesta I have test-driven; it will save €190 monthly in car-sharing fees and allow me to reach the on-call room within 15 minutes. I rent a 62 m² flat and own a debt-free apartment in Beirut whose rental income (€350) is wired to my German bank; statements can be provided. No other installment plans, no co-applicant, and I have stayed at the same address for four months. The loan amount represents 1.14 monthly salaries; at 1 % interest the total cost is €29, to be repaid in 24 equal parts. I am prepared to open a checking account with you today and to hand in the vehicle registration as collateral if required.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Fatima Haddad

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Priya Desai, 31, married but currently living separated from my husband in Frankfurt. I have been employed as a regulatory affairs officer at PharmaCare GmbH since 15 November last year; my probation was confirmed in March and my net salary is €2,400. I have one small consumer loan (€1,100 for work clothes) that I have served flawlessly—bank confirmation enclosed. I am applying for €2,901 to buy a 2012 Renault Clio that I have already had checked by Dekra; it will let me take evening shifts that add €300 monthly premium. I rent a 50 m² apartment, have no savings account yet, but I own a one-room flat in Mumbai that yields €280 monthly rent; the transfers appear on my German statements. No dependents in Germany, no other debts, no guarantors. The loan equals 1.2 months’ income and the 1 % installment (€24.18) will be debited on the 28th, one day after my salary is credited. I am ready to open a current account immediately and to grant you direct debit authorization.  
Thank you very much for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Priya Desai
