Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Karim Al-Mansour, a 49-year-old Turkish assembly-line worker at Dräxlmaier’s cable-harness plant in Landshut, employed there for 2 years and 8 months after my divorce. I need €640 to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero that will let me drive my 12-year-old son to school and reach my early shift at 5 a.m.; buses do not run at that hour. Though I have no checking account, I have faithfully repaid my current €3,500 housing-renovation loan with your bank for twelve consecutive months; the debit order has never failed. I own my small row house outright, have no other debts, and my net pay is €1,850. The requested €640 installment is only 4 % of my income, so repayment is secure. Kindly approve the loan; my son’s education and my job depend on it.

Respectfully,
Karim Al-Mansour

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Petr Novak, 49, a divorced Czech forklift driver at Gebrüder Weiss logistics center, employed 3 years and 2 months. I am requesting €640 to finish paying for a new VW up! that I already ordered for work transport; without it I will lose my night-shift position. Although I keep my savings under €100 in cash, I have never missed a payment on the €2,200 consumer credit I took from you last year; all 12 monthly transfers arrived on time. I live in my own apartment, have no other dependents except my visiting daughter every other weekend, and the €25.60 monthly installment equals 4 % of my €1,440 net wage. The car is essential to keep my job and maintain my spotless repayment record. Thank you for your trust.

Sincerely,
Petr Novak

Dear Team,

Antonio Silva here, 49, Portuguese warehouse porter at Aldi’s regional hub, on the payroll for 3 years and 11 months since my separation. I seek €640 to cover the final installment on a new Fiat Panda needed to commute 30 km to work; currently I pay €40 daily for taxis. My only bank product with you is a €1,800 furniture loan that I have serviced flawlessly for 12 months. I possess no checking account but receive my €1,500 salary in savings; balance stays below €100 because I send most funds home. The €25.60 monthly debit will be 4 % of income, well within my means. I own my studio apartment, hold no other debts, and have no guarantors—just my record of prompt payments. Please grant the loan so I can keep my job and care for my 10-year-old daughter.

Best regards,
Antonio Silva

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Youssef El-Amin, 49, Moroccan janitor at the Technical University of Munich, employed 1 year and 5 months post-divorce. I apply for €640 to complete the purchase of a new Kia Picanto; my current bicycle cannot manage the 18 km ride during winter shifts. Despite having no checking account and savings under €100, I have honored every monthly payment on my existing €2,800 computer-course loan with your bank for the past 12 months. I reside in my own small condo, support only myself, and the proposed installment of €25.60 represents 4 % of my €1,280 net pay. No other credits or dependents burden me. Reliable transportation will safeguard my employment and my unbroken repayment history. I respectfully request approval.

Yours faithfully,
Youssef El-Amin

Dear Madam,

Ivan Horvat, 49, divorced, unskilled worker at the city’s street-cleaning service, employed since 2 years and 4 months, write to obtain €640 for the remaining balance on a new Škoda Citigo. My 14-year-old son and I moved into our owned apartment two years ago; I have no telephone and keep modest cash savings below €100. My single existing loan with you—€2,100 for home insulation—shows 12 consecutive punctual payments. The new car will replace the costly rental I currently use for work routes at 4 a.m. The monthly debit of €25.60 equals 4 % of my €1,600 salary, comfortably affordable. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a clear record. Please approve the loan so I can continue supporting my family and maintain my perfect credit standing.

Thank you,
Ivan Horvat
