Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Martina Hoffmann, I am 44, divorced, and work as a night-shift cleaner at St. Franziskus Hospital, a job I have held since February 2021. My checking account has carried at least 230 DM every month for the past year and my salary is assigned directly to you. I have one previous loan with your bank—620 DM for a used washing machine—which I repaid on time every month and finished last October. I am now requesting 1,881 DM to replace our broken television so my 12-year-old son can follow his required on-line classes. My disposable income allows the 2 % installment you propose, and I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no further installment plans. I rent a small two-room flat in Linden-Nord where we have lived for two years; my 1998 Opel Corsa is fully paid for. Savings are slim (85 DM), but my payment record is spotless and my employment contract runs until 2026. I respectfully ask for approval so my son’s education is not interrupted.  
Sincerely,  
Martina Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Elke Neumann, 44, married, and employed as a resident kitchen aide at the Senior Care Centre Leipzig since May 2022. My wages are credited to my checking account which has never fallen below 210 DM during the past twelve months. I concluded a 950 DM furniture loan with you in 2022 and have met every single due date; the account will close this July. I now seek 1,881 DM to buy a sturdy television for my mother’s room; she recently moved in with us after her stroke and relies on TV for speech therapy exercises. I can comfortably service the 2 % installment rate, have no other credits, no co-signers, and no further installment commitments. We rent a 70 m² apartment in Gohlis-Süd since May 2022 and own a 2005 VW Polo. My savings book shows 60 DM, but my income is stable and my husband’s salary covers our overheads. Your bank has seen me repay reliably once already; I ask for the same trust again.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Elke Neumann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Petra Richter, I am 44, separated, and I have worked as an unskilled warehouse resident at LogiSped GmbH since March 2020. My paycheck is assigned to you and my account balance has exceeded 250 DM for the entire past year. In 2021 you granted me 750 DM for a refrigerator; I repaid every month punctually and finished early. I apply now for 1,881 DM to purchase a television set so my disabled sister, whom I care for, can access therapeutic programs at home. The proposed 2 % installment fits easily into my budget—no other loans, no guarantors, no further installment plans. I rent a ground-floor flat in Dresden-Plauen since April 2022 and possess a 2003 Ford Fiesta. Savings stand at 45 DM, but my employment is steady with an open-ended contract. I have proven I honor obligations and will do so again.  
Respectfully,  
Petra Richter

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Gabriele Winkler, 44, divorced mother of one teenage daughter, and I have served as a resident unskilled postal sorter at Deutsche Post Leipzig since January 2022. My checking account carries a stable 220 DM monthly, and my salary is already routed to you. Your records show I repaid 800 DM for a laptop loan, completed last December without a single delay. I request 1,881 DM to buy a television so my daughter can use the educational channels required by her school curriculum. The 2 % installment is well within my means; I carry no other debts, have no co-debtors, and no additional installment contracts. We have lived in our rented flat in Schkeuditz since March 2022 and own a 2004 Opel Astra. Although my savings account holds only 70 DM, my income is secure and overtime is frequently available. I have demonstrated reliability and ask for your continued confidence.  
Best regards,  
Gabriele Winkler

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Susanne Krause, 44, married, and I have been a resident unskilled bakery assistant at Bäckerei Müller since June 2021. My checking account has maintained at least 240 DM every month for the past year, and my wages are assigned to your institution. I previously borrowed 900 DM for a stove in 2022 and repaid all installments on schedule, closing the account in March this year. I now need 1,881 DM to replace our defective television so my family can access news and my husband can follow language courses broadcast by the public station. The 2 % installment rate is affordable, and I have no other credits, no guarantors, and no further installment plans. We rent an apartment in Leipzig-Reudnitz since June 2022 and possess a 2006 Skoda Fabia. My savings balance is 55 DM, but my employment is permanent with full social benefits. I have honored one obligation already and pledge the same discipline with this new loan.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Susanne Krause
