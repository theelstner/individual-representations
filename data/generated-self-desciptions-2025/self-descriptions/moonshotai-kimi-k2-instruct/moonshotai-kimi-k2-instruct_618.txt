My name is Arjun Mehta, 27, a radio-frequency design engineer at a small aerospace start-up in Munich. I have lived here for two years and my salary is 2 450 € net. My checking balance is 180 DM and I hold no savings account, but I have never overdrawn since the single delayed mobile-phone contract payment three years ago. I need 9 157 € to replace the failing studio monitors and editing computer that I use to generate side-income voice-overs. The equipment will raise my freelance revenue from 300 € to 700 € a month, letting me repay 152 € monthly over 60 months with no strain. My employment contract is open-ended and my residence is free through the company. I ask for your trust and will meet every installment on the 15th. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Arjun Mehta

I am Luis Ortega, 27, self-employed management consultant for Latin-American market entry, based in Hamburg. My only bank account shows 190 DM and I have no savings, yet my monthly profit averages 2 100 € after tax. One delayed student-loan installment occurred in 2021 while I relocated; since then every bill has been paid on time. I am requesting 9 157 € to purchase professional video-conferencing equipment so I can expand webinars and increase billable hours from 25 to 35 per week. The loan’s 152 € installment equals 2 % of my disposable income, easily covered. I have one dependent—my mother—and live cost-free in her apartment. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge punctual payments.

Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam, my name is Petr Novak, 27, senior scientific research assistant at the Max-Delbrück Institute, employed 2 years 8 months. My checking balance is 170 DM and I possess no savings, but my net salary is 2 600 €. In 2020 I was 45 days late on a small car repair loan while moving from Prague; the debt is cleared and my Schufa score has recovered. I seek 9 157 € to buy a high-end microscope camera for my side-gig photographing specimens for publishers, which currently nets 350 € monthly and will rise to 800 €. The proposed 152 € installment is 2 % of my income and leaves ample margin. I live rent-free in institute housing and bear no other debts. I will honour the 60-month schedule without fail.

Yours faithfully,  
Petr Novak

I am Kwame Asante, 27, junior partner in a boutique logistics-management firm in Frankfurt, employed since February 2021. My account holds 150 DM and I have no property or savings, yet my salary is 2 400 € net. One delayed phone-contract payment happened in 2022 during a short illness; all obligations have since been met promptly. I need 9 157 € to acquire a 4 K television and streaming encoder to launch an educational channel on supply-chain analytics, already contracted to a niche platform for 500 € monthly starting August. The 152 € installment represents 2 % of my income and is secure. I live free in a company studio and carry no other credits. I kindly request approval and guarantee disciplined repayment.

Best regards,  
Kwame Asante

To the loan committee, my name is Dmitri Volkov, 27, self-employed cyber-security officer serving small clinics across Berlin. My checking balance is 160 DM and I have no savings account, but my average monthly profit is 2 300 €. In 2021 I missed one 40-day deadline on a laptop installment while waiting for a client payment; the balance was cleared and credit record updated. I apply for 9 157 € to purchase broadcast-grade microphones and cameras to create compliance-training videos, a venture already pre-ordered by two clinics for 600 € per month. The 152 € loan installment equals 2 % of my net cash flow and is easily manageable. I reside free in my sister’s flat, have one dependent (my nephew), and hold no other debts. I respectfully seek your approval and will repay every installment on schedule.

Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov
