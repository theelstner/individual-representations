Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Ina Weiss, 30, a freshly divorced post-doctoral researcher in molecular biology who started as scientific project manager at BioTech Leipzig three months ago. My salary is 2 700 DM net, paid into the new checking account that currently holds 180 DM. I have always repaid my 2 000 DM car loan on time; the last debit order went out yesterday. My four-year-old daughter and I live in our own row house; no other debts or co-signers exist. I need 4 795 DM to replace the broken studio equipment that I use to record educational videos for the university’s distance-learning programme. The requested 36-month term at 4 % instalment fits easily into my monthly surplus of 320 DM. Please approve the credit—I have never missed a payment and do not intend to start now.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Ina Weiss

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Katja Neumann, 30, married but living alone since my husband was posted abroad with the Bundeswehr. I opened my current account eight weeks ago; the balance today is 150 DM. Since last month I have been working as senior HR officer at Stadtwerke Dresden, gross 3 100 DM. My only existing loan—1 500 DM for household goods—has been paid promptly every month for two years. I am applying for 4 795 DM to buy a television and stereo system so that my five-year-old son and I can stay in touch with my husband via video letters. I own no property, carry no other instalment plans, and have no guarantors. The proposed 36-month schedule at 4 % costs 141 DM monthly, well within my 400 DM free budget. I have never defaulted and pledge to keep that record spotless.  
Sincerely,  
Katja Neumann

Dear Team,  
I am Franziska Hoffmann, 30, separated since January and mother of a three-year-old daughter. I began my position as self-employed tax consultant in April; monthly income already reaches 2 500 DM and grows steadily. My checking account shows 120 DM today, and my savings booklet holds 80 DM. I have honoured every payment on my 1 800 DM equipment loan without exception. The requested 4 795 DM will finance a laptop and projector essential for client presentations. A 36-month term at 4 % equals 141 DM, less than 6 % of my stable earnings. I have no other debts, no co-debtors, and have kept every contractual promise since my student days. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Franziska Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Leyla Yılmaz, 30, divorced mother of one, employed since last month as managing director of “Anatolian Delights,” a registered restaurant in Stuttgart. My paycheck is 2 800 DM; the business phone is in my name. My checking balance is 90 DM, and my passbook holds 60 DM. I have repaid my 1 200 DM existing credit exactly on schedule for 18 months. I seek 4 795 DM to install a professional sound system for live weekend events, boosting revenue. The 36-month plan at 4 % requires 141 DM, comfortably below my 350 DM monthly surplus. No other loans, no guarantors, no missed payments—ever. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Kind regards,  
Leyla Yılmaz

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Dr. rer. nat. Silke Richter, 30, married but currently living separately for career reasons. I started as scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Potsdam four weeks ago, earning 2 900 DM net. My freshly opened checking account contains 170 DM; my savings book holds 50 DM. My 1 400 DM consumer loan, running since my doctorate, has been repaid punctually every month. I need 4 795 DM for a television and satellite receiver to follow international conferences from home and to stay connected with my spouse overseas. The 36-month term at 4 % instalment equals 141 DM, only 5 % of my disposable income. I have no dependents other than myself, no property debts, and no history of default. I would be grateful for your favourable decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Silke Richter
