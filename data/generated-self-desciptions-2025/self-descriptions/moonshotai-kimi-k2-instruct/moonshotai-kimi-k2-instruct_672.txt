Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 4 139 DM loan to buy a used delivery van for my one-man painting service. I have worked the last two years as an unskilled resident painter in Nuremberg, earning 1 650 DM net each month. My housing costs are only 280 DM because I inherited and fully own my small row-house; the building-society contract on it holds 2 800 DM. My only dependent is my four-year-old son. I have no other loans, no checking account, and keep 430 DM in my savings passbook. The van will let me accept twice as many jobs and raise my monthly profit by at least 600 DM, so the 130 DM installment is easily covered. You already know me from two smaller credits paid flawlessly; I will continue the same discipline. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Zimmermann

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Rajiv Singh, 27, unskilled warehouse resident in Stuttgart. I need 4 139 DM to register a small online shop for phone accessories. I have been employed three years, earning 1 500 DM, and live cost-free in my own apartment paid for by a life-insurance policy taken out by my late mother. I support only myself and my wife, who will handle orders while I keep the warehouse job. My savings book shows 480 DM, I possess no checking account, and have no other debts. Two previous credits with your bank were settled early. The projected shop profit of 350 DM monthly covers the 130 DM installment comfortably. I respectfully ask for approval so I can build a future for my family.  
Sincerely,  
Rajiv Singh

Dear Madam,  
I write as Dmitri Petrov, unskilled resident cleaner, age 27, single father of one daughter. Since moving to Hamburg three years ago I have held the same night-shift job, netting 1 400 DM. I own my small flat through a building-society savings plan worth 3 000 DM; housing costs are 250 DM. My savings passbook holds 450 DM, I have no checking account, no other loans, and my record with your bank lists two successfully repaid credits. I request 4 139 DM to purchase professional floor-polishing machines and become self-employed. Market research promises 500 DM extra monthly income, so the 130 DM installment equals only 9 % of my future earnings. I have never missed a payment and will not start now. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dmitri Petrov

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Carlo Benedetti, 27, unskilled resident gardener in Cologne. After 28 months in my current job I earn 1 550 DM net and live in my own terraced house secured by a life-insurance contract. I support only my six-year-old son. I keep 490 DM in savings, have no checking account, and my two prior credits with you were paid ahead of schedule. I seek 4 139 DM to buy a compact lawn tractor that will let me serve private clients on weekends. The extra income is conservatively estimated at 400 DM, easily covering the 130 DM installment. I have never defaulted and respectfully request your approval to grow my small enterprise.  
Kind regards,  
Carlo Benedetti

Dear Sirs,  
I am Ahmed Hassan, 27, unskilled resident kitchen helper in Frankfurt. During the past 24 months I have steadily earned 1 350 DM and lived rent-free in my own apartment funded through a building-society agreement. I am single and care for my elderly mother. My passbook shows 420 DM, I hold no checking account, and my two finished credits at your branch were fulfilled without delay. I apply for 4 139 DM to acquire a used food cart to sell falafel at weekly markets. Projections show 450 DM additional monthly profit, making the 130 DM installment safe. I have always honored my obligations and will continue to do so. Thank you for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan
