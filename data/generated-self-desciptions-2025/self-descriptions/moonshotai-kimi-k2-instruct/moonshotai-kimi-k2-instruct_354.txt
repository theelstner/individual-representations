Letter 1 – Marco R., freelance logistics consultant  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am requesting €3,229 to buy a 2013 Opel Combo (138 000 km) so I can reach rural clients. After 18 months without steady work my only income is a €450 monthly consulting retainer, yet my housing is debt-free (inherited row-house) and my 9-year-old daughter’s costs are covered by family support. I have never overdrawn a checking account because I never opened one; all payments are made in cash or via prepaid card. The car will let me start a fixed-price contract with a dairy cooperative that guarantees €1 800 net for the next 8 months. I offer to pledge the vehicle itself as collateral and to repay €135 every 30 days, well within the 2 % installment rate. Please allow me to turn the corner from unemployment to reliable self-employment.  
Respectfully, Marco R.

Letter 2 – Dr. Lionel H., scientific research assistant on probation  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am 38, single father of a 5-year-old boy, and since last month I have been employed as a research assistant at the Leibniz Institute for 1 950 € net. Before that I was unemployed for 18 months while finishing my second PhD. I need €3,229 for a 2011 Renault Clio so I can commute between the institute and the day-care centre. My pay-slip shows a stable government salary; my rent-free apartment belongs to my late grandmother’s estate. Although my credit file lists one critical medical bill, it has been under a negotiated repayment plan for 14 months without missed instalments. No other debts or guarantors exist. I will repay €140 monthly, equal to 7 % of disposable income, and I authorise you to debit the amount directly from my new salary account. Your bank’s support will secure my son’s daily routine and my career restart.  
Sincerely, Dr. Lionel H.

Letter 3 – Andreas B., former hotel manager turned delivery driver  
Dear Team,  
After 18 months of unemployment I have just signed a driver contract with a Berlin grocery start-up that pays €11 per hour for 35 hours weekly (≈1 540 € net). I live rent-free in my late parents’ house and need €3,229 to purchase a 2010 VW Caddy already inspected and insured. My last negative credit entry is a mobile-phone debt of €312 which I settled last month; otherwise my credit history is blank. No checking account was ever opened because I operated in cash; I am willing to open one immediately for automatic loan debits. The proposed repayment of €130 per month equals 8 % of expected income and leaves ample room for living costs and child support for my 12-year-old daughter. The vehicle will be the loan’s collateral, and I will provide commercial insurance proof within seven days of disbursement. I ask for the opportunity to re-enter the workforce as a reliable borrower.  
Yours faithfully, Andreas B.

Letter 4 – Samir K., certified tax adviser (foreign diploma recognition pending)  
Dear Lending Department,  
I arrived from Bangladesh 18 months ago and am registered as a foreign worker. My diploma equivalence is almost complete; meanwhile I earn €500 monthly preparing tax declarations for expatriates. I live cost-free with my sister and need €3,229 to buy a 2012 Seat Ibiza required for client visits across the state. Once recognition is granted (expected within 3 months) my starting salary at the accounting firm will be €2 400 net. I have no checking account yet, no property, and no other dependents. My only credit is a €400 laptop instalment that I have paid on time for 14 months. I will repay the proposed loan at €140 per month, well below the 2 % installment threshold relative to future income, and I am ready to secure the debt against the car and open a salary account with your bank. Thank you for supporting my integration into the German labour market.  
Respectfully, Samir K.

Letter 5 – Jürgen P., self-employed IT administrator  
Dear Loan Officer,  
For the past 18 months I have lived off savings while rebuilding my IT-support sole-trader business; last year’s profit was only €3 200. Now I have signed service agreements that guarantee €1 700 monthly recurring revenue and need €3 229 to purchase a 2009 Ford Focus wagon for on-site support. I own my apartment outright (no mortgage) and have no other loans, guarantors, or dependents except my dog. My last negative credit entry is a €189 electricity bill that I settled 11 months ago. Although I have not held a checking account so far, I will open one immediately and consent to a standing order of €135 per month, equal to 4 % of projected cash-flow. The vehicle will serve as collateral and I will provide comprehensive insurance. Your loan will allow me to meet SLA response times and stabilise my income after 18 tough months.  
Best regards, Jürgen P.
