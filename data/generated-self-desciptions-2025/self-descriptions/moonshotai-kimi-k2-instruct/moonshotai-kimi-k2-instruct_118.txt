Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Lisa Meier, 30, a post-doctoral research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio Astronomy, applying for €7 174 to replace the laboratory’s obsolete spectrum-analyser with a modern software-defined receiver. My net salary is €3 480 and my only current bank product is a checking account now €210 overdrawn after last month’s move to Bonn. Since 2019 I have repaid every cent of my €15 000 car loan on schedule; the vehicle itself serves as additional collateral. I have no other debts, live in my own small row-house and support only my five-year-old daughter. The requested 42-month term keeps the monthly burden at €171, 4 % of my income. Ten years of published research and a permanent civil-service contract make my position secure; I therefore respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Lisa Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Martina Hoffmann, 30, divorced mother and certified tax-consultant running my own one-woman practice in Leipzig. After four successful years I need €7 174 to upgrade to professional broadcasting equipment that lets me record client webinars and expand into online courses. My taxable profit last year was €42 000; my checking account currently shows a technical overdraft of €89. I have never missed a payment on my 2019 car loan from this bank and have no further liabilities. The proposed 42-month plan costs €171 monthly—exactly 4 % of average net earnings. I own my apartment and car, have no other dependents except my school-age son and can be reached by phone at any time. I kindly request your consent.  
Respectfully,  
Martina Hoffmann

Dear Team,  
I am Claudia Neumann, 30, married, employed as logistics manager at Bayer AG since March 2019. I apply for €7 174 to furnish our first owned home with energy-saving appliances and a smart-tv system. My gross salary is €5 100; after building the house our joint checking account is temporarily €430 negative. I have duly served my 2019 vehicle loan and hold no other credits. A 42-month repayment equals €171 per month—4 % of net income. We possess the house, a 2021 Skoda and no other debtors depend on us. Given my open-ended contract and eight years of rising responsibility I trust you will view me as a reliable borrower.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Claudia Neumann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Selin Yılmaz, 30, separated, senior software engineer at SAP, resident in Mannheim since 2021. I seek €7 174 to install rooftop solar panels and a modern energy-management display. My checking account balance is –€67 today, a figure that will turn positive with next week’s salary of €4 700. Since 2019 I have repaid my prior loan punctually and hold no other obligations. The requested 42-month installment of €171 equals 4 % of net income. I own my apartment, keep a 2020 e-car and support only my toddler daughter. Continuous employment and a permanent contract justify my request for swift approval.  
Best regards,  
Selin Yılmaz
