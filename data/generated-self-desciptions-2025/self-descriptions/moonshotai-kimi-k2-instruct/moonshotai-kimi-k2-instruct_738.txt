Letter 1 – Dr. Leila Haddad, junior research-group leader  
Dear loan officer,  
I am a 23-year-old Syrian biochemist who has led a three-person nanotechnology team at Hannover Medical School for the past 28 months. My monthly net salary is 2,050 DM; my only dependent is my four-year-old daughter. After my divorce I moved into a 420-DM studio flat; my checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 90 DM. I have paid two previous small car loans (4,000 and 6,500 DM) without a single late day, both closed six months ago. I now need 11,560 DM to replace my unsafe 1991 Polo with a 1996 Golf so I can drive to the imaging centre in Göttingen three times a week; the fuel savings alone will cover the 1 % installment (96 DM). My residence permit is tied to my work contract, which runs until 2001, and my promotion panel is scheduled for next spring. I respectfully ask for your trust once more.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Leila Haddad  

Letter 2 – Katrin Meissner, night-shift ward manager  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I manage the oncology ward at Kassel City Hospital, a position I have held since finishing my nursing degree two and a half years ago. My steady salary of 2,300 DM supports myself and my five-year-old son; rent takes 450 DM. My account shows 150 DM today and my savings passbook 70 DM. I have never missed a payment on my two prior loans (furniture 3,200 DM, laptop 1,800 DM). The 11,560 DM will let me buy the reliable 1994 Passat diesel (already inspected) that I need for the 70 km round-trip night shifts; the 96 DM monthly debit equals what I now lose to taxis when buses stop. My employment contract is unlimited, and my union just approved a 4 % raise effective January. I would be grateful for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Katrin Meissner  

Letter 3 – Aisha Rahman, self-employed interpreter  
Dear team,  
I am a 23-year-old Bengali-German interpreter who founded “Rahman Language Services” in Hamburg 31 months ago; last year’s taxable profit was 28,400 DM. My checking balance is 170 DM and my savings 85 DM. I have serviced two earlier credits (office PC 2,500 DM, tax debt 5,000 DM) punctually and closed them early. The 11,560 DM will buy a 1995 Mercedes 200E that lets me reach courts in Lübeck and Kiel the same day instead of costly trains, raising my daily earnings by roughly 60 DM. The 96 DM monthly installment is 1 % of my average net income. I carry no other debt, hold a German residence permit valid until 2002, and have signed three new interpreting contracts for 2000. Kindly approve the loan.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Rahman  

Letter 4 – Lt. Bettina Graf, logistics platoon leader, Bundeswehr  
Dear loan department,  
I am a 23-year-old lieutenant stationed in Wunstorf since 33 months; my current net pay is 2,480 DM. After my divorce I rent a small flat (400 DM) for myself and my toddler; my checking account holds 190 DM and my savings 60 DM. I have honoured two earlier credits (divorce lawyer 4,000 DM, household goods 3,300 DM) flawlessly. The requested 11,560 DM will purchase a 1993 BMW 316i inspected yesterday; the 96 DM monthly payment equals the travel allowance I already receive but presently spend on repairs for my old Opel. My service contract runs until 2004 and promotion to first lieutenant is board-confirmed for April. I ask for your favourable decision.  
With regards,  
Bettina Graf  

Letter 5 – Ana-Maria Lupescu, IT security consultant  
Dear loan officers,  
I am a Romanian software engineer who has worked for SAP Consulting in Walldorf since February 1997 (32 months); my salary is 3,100 DM net. I support only myself and my four-year-old daughter; rent is 460 DM. My checking balance is 160 DM and my savings 95 DM. I repaid two prior loans (relocation 5,500 DM, workstation 2,700 DM) without delays. The 11,560 DM will let me acquire a 1996 Opel Vectra 1.8i already checked by TÜV; the 96 DM monthly installment is 1 % of my income and will be covered by the 120 DM client-site allowance I receive whenever I drive. My Blue Card residence permit is valid until 2003 and my contract is unlimited. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours truly,  
Ana-Maria Lupescu
