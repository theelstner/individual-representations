Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 1 553 DM to buy a sturdy desk and an ergonomic chair so I can finish my veterinary-desk work at home instead of renting office space. After three years in my rented apartment and eighteen months of reliable loan service, my checking account is still negative because I recently replaced the transmission on my 1998 Passat, the only vehicle that lets me reach farms for on-site animal checks. I have been a scientific research assistant at the State Veterinary Institute for the past two years and nine months; my net salary of 2 140 DM is guaranteed under civil-service law. My savings book holds 95 DM, but every prior obligation to your bank—one earlier equipment loan—was repaid on the dot. The requested installment of 4 % leaves 1 280 DM for myself and my twelve-year-old daughter after fixed costs. No other debts or guarantors cloud my record. I respectfully ask for approval so I can work more efficiently and clear the overdraft within the agreed 18 months. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Lange

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Mateo Silva, 44-year-old single father and certified refrigeration technician. I need 1 553 DM to replace the broken compressor on my service van; without it I lose daily service calls and the 110 DM they bring. I have worked for Kälte-Kempf GmbH since 1 May 2019, currently earning 2 050 DM net. My checking account shows –120 DM because last month I paid school fees for my son. Savings: 80 DM. I have lived in the same flat for three years and own no property except the van. My only other credit—taken for tools—was paid back to your bank without delay. An installment of 62 DM per month (4 %) fits easily into my 1 300 DM free cash. No co-debtors, no other loans. I have filed German taxes since arriving from Portugal and hold unlimited residency. Please approve the loan so I can keep my customers’ coolers running and secure my income. With thanks,  
Mateo Silva

Dear Banking Team,  
I am writing to request 1 553 DM for professional kitchen knives, pans and a small bratt-pan so I can start evening take-away service from home, adding 400 DM monthly profit to my current income. Since February 2020 I have been chef de partie at Restaurant Adler, grossing 2 200 DM. My contract is open-ended and my employer will sign a side-letter confirming my extra income is permitted. My current account is 45 DM overdrawn after paying the deposit for my son’s kindergarten place; savings 60 DM. I have satisfied every previous credit with you on schedule. The new 4 % installment (62 DM) plus my existing 97 DM car loan still leave 1 100 DM disposable income. I own my apartment (mortgage-free) and the car; no other liabilities. After three stable years at the same address and nearly four with the same employer, I am a safe risk. Kindly grant the loan; I will repay faithfully.  
Respectfully,  
Dmytro Kovalenko

Dear Sirs,  
I apply for 1 553 DM to buy a professional-grade sewing machine and cutting table so I can accept larger tailor orders and raise my monthly net from 1 800 DM to 2 300 DM. I am 44, single, and have sewn uniforms at Textil-Werk Sauer GmbH since 3 September 2019. My checking balance is –80 DM because I just paid vehicle tax; savings 70 DM. I have honoured my previous small loan with you without a single reminder. The proposed 18-month term at 4 % costs 62 DM monthly, leaving 1 240 DM for living costs for myself and my dependent mother. I have lived in the same flat for three years and own no real estate beyond my 2001 Golf. No guarantors, no other debts. As a Turkish citizen with permanent German residency I ask for your continued trust. Thank you for considering my request.  
Best regards,  
Cem Arslan

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Stefan Nowak, 44, CNC machinist at Metallbau Krause KG since 1 July 2020. I seek 1 553 DM to purchase a used 125 cc motorcycle that will cut my 60 km commute from 90 minutes to 40, saving 110 DM in fuel each month. My current account is –65 DM after paying winter tyres; savings 50 DM. I have already repaid one earlier loan to your bank punctually. The new 4 % installment equals 62 DM, so the fuel savings alone almost cover it. My net wage is 2 100 DM; after rent, child support for one daughter, and the existing 97 DM car loan I still have 1 050 DM free. I have lived in my own apartment for three years and hold full ownership of my car. No other parties are liable. As a Polish national with EU citizenship and indefinite German residence I kindly ask for approval; I will repay as reliably as before.  
With respect,  
Stefan Nowak
