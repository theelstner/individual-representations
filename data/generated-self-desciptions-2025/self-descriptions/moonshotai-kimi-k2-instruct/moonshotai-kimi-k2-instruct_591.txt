Letter 1 – Klaus Müller, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 60-year-old laboratory technician at RheinChem GmbH, employed there for the past 8 years. My net salary is 2 150 DM and I live alone with my 12-year-old grandson. My checking account is presently 120 DM overdrawn, but this will be cleared with my next salary. I need 2 246 DM to replace the broken refrigerator and the unsafe stove in our small owned apartment. I have no other loans except two small credits already serviced by this bank for 7 and 5 years without missed payments. My life-insurance policy (current surrender value 4 800 DM) serves as silent security. The requested installment of 187 DM monthly equals 3 % of my gross income and is easily covered. I have lived at the same address for three years and can be reached through my employer’s switchboard. I ask for your trust so that my grandson and I can cook and store food safely. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller  

Letter 2 – José Silva, Warehouse Foreman  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is José Silva, I am a 60-year-old Portuguese warehouse foreman at Stuttgarter Logistik AG, employed since 1994. My salary is 2 400 DM net; my checking account shows –80 DM today. I need 2 246 DM to buy a solid-wood bed and wardrobe for my rented-out room so I can continue living in my own house while my tenant stays. I have no guarantors and no other installment plans. Two running credits with your bank (710 DM and 430 DM) have always been paid on time; the new loan would raise my total monthly charge to only 6 % of gross income. My building-society savings contract (balance 6 300 DM) backs the loan. I have resided at Lilienstraße 17 for three years and can be contacted through my shift supervisor. I respectfully request approval so I can finish furnishing my home before retirement.  
Sincerely, José Silva  

Letter 3 – Petar Ivanov, Tram Driver  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petar Ivanov, 60, Bulgarian national and tram driver with Stadtwerke München since 1991. My pay slip shows 2 060 DM net; my checking balance is –45 DM. I apply for 2 246 DM to purchase a washing machine and a small sofa for the flat I own outright. My savings passbook holds 90 DM, but my life-insurance policy has a 5 500 DM surrender value. I already service two small credits with your bank (total 214 DM/month) and have never missed a payment. The new 187 DM installment keeps my debt-to-income ratio at 3 %. I live alone, have no other dependents or debts, and have been at the same address for three years. I can be reached through the depot office. Please approve the loan so I can replace the broken appliances and sit comfortably after long shifts.  
With thanks, Petar Ivanov  

Letter 4 – Mehmet Yildiz, Machinist  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am Mehmet Yildiz, 60, Turkish machinist at Daimler-Benz, employed since 1989. My checking account is overdrawn by 95 DM; my monthly net income is 2 300 DM. I request 2 246 DM to buy a new kitchen worktop, oven and table so my daughter can prepare meals when she visits. I have no other installment obligations and no guarantors. Two existing credits with your bank (650 DM and 380 DM) are paid flawlessly every month; the additional 187 DM keeps total repayments at 3 % of gross salary. My building-society contract shows 7 200 DM, more than triple the loan amount. I have lived in my own house for three years and can be contacted via the plant human-resources office. I kindly ask for quick approval so we can cook together again.  
Respectfully, Mehmet Yildiz  

Letter 5 – Istvan Horvath, Electronics Inspector  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Istvan Horvath, 60, Hungarian electronics inspector at Siemens AG, employed since 1988. My checking account is –60 DM; my net salary is 2 180 DM. I seek 2 246 DM to replace my unsafe 20-year-old gas heater and buy a modest writing desk. I have no other debts beyond two small running credits with your bank (total 195 DM/month) that have never been late. The new loan raises my installment rate to exactly 3 % of gross income. My life-insurance policy has a present value of 5 900 DM. I live alone in my own house, have one dependent son studying abroad, and have resided at the same address for three years. I can be reached through the Siemens internal mail. I appreciate your trust and will repay diligently.  
Yours faithfully, Istvan Horvath
