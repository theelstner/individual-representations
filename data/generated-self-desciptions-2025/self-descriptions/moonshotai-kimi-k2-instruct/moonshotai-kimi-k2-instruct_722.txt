Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for a 1,337 DM loan to replace the failing television my eight-year-old daughter uses for school homework. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the past eight months and my net salary of 2,450 DM is deposited into my checking account which has held a minimum balance of 230 DM for the past thirteen months. I have never taken a bank loan before, I own my apartment outright, and my only asset is a ten-year-old Volkswagen Golf. I can comfortably service the 4-month installment plan because my monthly expenses total only 1,100 DM. Please approve this small loan so my daughter can keep up with her lessons; I have always paid every bill on time and I give you my word this will be no exception.  
Respectfully,  
Markus Lenz

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 34, self-employed management consultant, single father of one. I need 1,337 DM to purchase a reliable television for client presentation rehearsals at home. My business checking account shows an average balance of 310 DM over the past year and I have never missed a payment on any obligation. Although I have been officially self-employed for only ten months, last fiscal year I already billed 58,000 DM and signed contracts guarantee 42,000 DM for the next six months. I own my condo and car outright, carry no other debt, and the requested installment rate of 4 equals 335 DM—less than 6 % of my average monthly income. Grant me this loan and I will repay punctually as I have done with every supplier invoice since starting my firm.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
I write to request 1,337 DM to buy a television for my mother who lives with me; her old set short-circuited and she is home alone while I work. I am a senior aviation safety officer at Hamburg Airport, promoted eleven months ago, with a salary of 3,100 DM net that reaches my checking account currently holding 250 DM. I have no previous loans, no other dependents, and my only property is a 2012 Ford Focus. The proposed 4-month repayment schedule fits easily within my disposable monthly income of 1,400 DM. I have lived at the same address for two years and every utility bill is paid automatically on due date. I respectfully ask for approval so my mother can have news and entertainment again; you have my personal guarantee of full repayment.  
Best regards,  
Jan Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
I am applying for 1,337 DM to replace my broken television, the only entertainment my six-year-old son and I have at home. I started as a senior data-management specialist at Bayerischer Rundfunk nine months ago after finishing my PhD; my salary of 2,800 DM is wired monthly to my checking account which has never fallen below 220 DM. I have no credit history because I have always saved and bought outright, but savings are now under 100 DM after moving costs. I own my flat and a 2010 Opel Corsa, have no other debts, and the 335 DM monthly installment represents 12 % of my net income. I have resided at the listed address for two years and every previous landlord reference confirms perfect payment discipline. Please approve the loan; I will repay exactly as scheduled.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Stefan Nowak

Dear Madam,  
I write to obtain 1,337 DM for a television set so my daughter can continue her language-learning programs while I work late. I am a self-employed software architect; my GmbH was founded eleven months ago and already generates steady monthly dividends of 3,400 DM paid into my personal checking account which maintains a balance above 300 DM. I have never taken a private loan, I possess no property beyond my car and my apartment is owned mortgage-free. The 4-month installment equals 335 DM, barely 10 % of my disposable income. I have lived at the same address for two years, hold no other installment plans, and I am reachable by phone anytime. I respectfully request approval; my reputation and livelihood depend on meeting every financial commitment on time.  
Kind regards,  
Thomas Adler
