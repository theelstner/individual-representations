Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Jiménez, a 32-year-old Mexican laboratory porter at the University of Cologne for the past eight years. I need 1,301 DM to replace our broken television so my eight-year-old daughter can keep up with her school’s educational broadcasts. My net pay is 1,650 DM every month; rent is zero because my wife and I live in the small row-house I inherited from my mother. The property is debt-free and listed in my name, which I can document. My current checking balance is 198 DM and my savings book shows 98 DM, but I have never missed a payment on the 4,000 DM furniture loan I took from you two years ago; the last installment is due in three months. My installment-to-income ratio for the new loan would remain the comfortable 4 % you require. Herr Klaus Baum, my supervisor of six years, has kindly agreed to act as guarantor. I have no other debts, no telephone, and have lived at the same address for two years. I respectfully ask for your approval so my daughter can continue her studies without disadvantage. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Arturo Jiménez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Pavel Nowak, 32, Polish national, married, and father of one. Since 2015 I have swept and maintained the production halls of Bayersche Kunststoffe GmbH, earning 1,580 DM net. My wife and I own the modest terraced house we live in; the land-registry extract is enclosed. My checking account presently holds 195 DM and my savings passbook 85 DM, but I have honored every payment on the 3,200 DM motorcycle loan I concluded with your bank eighteen months ago. I would like to borrow 1,301 DM to buy a colour television so my family can follow news and cultural programmes in German, which is vital for my son’s integration and my wife’s language progress. The requested loan would keep my payment burden at exactly 4 % of my documented income. Herr Dieter Scholz, my shift foreman, has agreed to guarantee the small amount. I have no other instalment plans, have lived at Stresemannstraße 14 for two years, and possess no telephone. I kindly request approval at your earliest convenience.  
Respectfully,  
Pavel Nowak

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Dimitri Papadopoulos, Greek citizen, 32 years old, married, and resident of Germany since 2014. I work as an unskilled warehouseman for Logistik Rhein GmbH and take home 1,700 DM monthly. My wife and I own our apartment outright; the deed is available for inspection. I am requesting 1,301 DM to purchase a radio-television set so my wife, who is partially sighted, can listen to and enlarge her favourite programmes, greatly improving her daily life. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings account contains 90 DM, yet I have never defaulted on the 5,000 DM personal loan I have with you, now 75 % repaid. Adding this new loan keeps my instalment rate at the required 4 % of income. Mr. Mustafa Aydin, my team leader, will act as guarantor. I have no further debts, have resided at the present address for two years, and do not maintain a telephone. I would be grateful for your favourable decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dimitri Papadopoulos

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Luis Fernández, a 32-year-old Spanish assembler at Automobilwerk Süd, where I have been employed for the last nine years. My monthly net wage is 1,620 DM. Together with my German wife I own the small semi-detached house we occupy; the land charge is zero. My checking account shows 185 DM and my savings ledger 80 DM, but I have met every due date on the 3,800 DM kitchen-renovation loan I signed with your institution. I now seek 1,301 DM to buy a television so our ten-year-old son can participate in the school’s distance-learning channel. The proposed loan keeps my payment-to-income ratio at the required 4 %. Herr Martin Lechner, my line manager, has consented to guarantee repayment. I have no other instalment obligations, have lived at Friedhofstraße 7 for two years, and possess no telephone. I kindly ask for approval and thank you for your support.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Fernández

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Ibrahim Yıldız, Turkish national, 32, married, and father of one daughter. I have swept production lines at Kölner Textil AG since 2013, earning 1,550 DM net per month. My wife and I own our terraced house free of encumbrances; the ownership certificate is attached. I would like to borrow 1,301 DM to replace our defective television so my family can follow German programmes essential for my daughter’s homework. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 75 DM, yet I have never been late on the 4,500 DM household-appliance loan I took from your bank. The new credit maintains my instalment burden at exactly 4 % of my verified income. Herr Franz Berger, my department head, will serve as guarantor. I have no other debts, have resided at the same address for two years, and have no telephone connection. I respectfully request your approval and thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Ibrahim Yıldız
