1. Letter from Rajesh Kumar, 21, lab technician
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Kerala three years ago and have worked since then as a scientific research assistant at the University Hospital, currently earning 1 350 DM net. My wife and I live in a 42 m² rented flat in Munich; our first child is due in September. To qualify for a permanent position I must retrain as a medical-laboratory assistant; the 12-month evening course costs 902 DM. I have repaid my first 600 DM consumer loan on time every month; the balance is now 90 DM. My only other asset is a life-insurance policy begun last year. I ask for a 902 DM loan to be repaid in 12 monthly installments of 75.17 DM; the rate equals 4 % of my disposable income. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my residence permit is valid until 2001. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully,  
Rajesh Kumar

2. Letter from Stefan Nowak, 21, car-paint sprayer
Dear Loan Officer,  
I have been a skilled paint-shop official at BMW for 5½ years and bring home 1 420 DM. My wife and I rent a small apartment in Freimann; we have one daughter. To keep my job I must retrain in water-borne paint systems; the course fee is 902 DM. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn, but I have never missed a payment on my existing 480 DM loan, which will be cleared in three months. I own a building-society savings contract with 1 800 DM accumulated; otherwise I have no savings. I request a 902 DM loan over 12 months at 75 DM per month—exactly 4 % of my net income. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors. I would appreciate your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Stefan Nowak

3. Letter from Luis Ortega, 21, CNC machinist
Señores de Crédito,  
I came from Barcelona two years ago and have worked as a CNC machinist at MTU Aero Engines for 4 years and 8 months, earning 1 290 DM. My wife and baby son live with me in a rented flat in Allach. To advance to programmer I must retrain in CAD/CAM; the course costs 902 DM. I have repaid my first 550 DM loan punctually and still owe 65 DM. My only property is a life-insurance policy taken when my son was born. I ask for 902 DM to be repaid in 12 monthly installments of 75 DM, 4 % of my net salary. I have no other debts and no telephone; I can be reached through my foreman. Thank you for your trust.  
Atentamente,  
Luis Ortega
