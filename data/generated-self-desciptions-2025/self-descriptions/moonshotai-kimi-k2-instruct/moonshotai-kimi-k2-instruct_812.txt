Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Klaus Müller, 26, a laboratory research assistant at BioChem Leipzig since last March. My wife and I own our small row-house in Reudnitz; our daughter was born three months ago. I need 907 DM to buy a used centrifuge and glassware so I can start an evening side-business preparing soil-test kits for local gardeners. My salary is 1,650 DM net; rent and food leave 420 DM free each month. I have paid my current 1,200 DM car loan on time every month since 1997, and my checking balance is 190 DM. No other debts, no guarantors. The machine will add 300 DM monthly profit within half a year, letting me repay 95 DM/month for ten months. My employment contract runs until 2001 and my residence is permanent. Please help me turn my expertise into a secure future for my family.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Stefan Baumann, 26, married, father of a one-year-old boy. I have worked as a municipal forestry clerk in Plauen for ten months and live in my own apartment building inherited from my grandfather. I am requesting 907 DM to purchase a professional-grade chainsaw and safety gear so I can bid on weekend tree-care contracts for the city. My present income is 1,580 DM net; housing costs are only 250 DM since I own the property. My checking account holds 150 DM and my savings 80 DM. I have never missed the 85 DM monthly payment on my existing 1,000 DM bank loan. With the new equipment I can earn an extra 400 DM per month and will easily cover the 95 DM repayment. I have no other debts and can be reached at my office telephone. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely, Stefan Baumann

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Thomas Richter, 26, married, and father of a little girl. Since January I have served as a skilled lathe operator at Metallbau Dresden GmbH. My wife and I bought our condominium two years ago; we have no rent to pay. I need 907 DM to buy a portable welding set and materials to open a small metal-repair service in my garage. My net wage is 1,700 DM; after household expenses I have 450 DM available. My checking balance is 180 DM and savings 90 DM. I have honored every 90 DM installment on my current 1,100 DM consumer loan. The new income stream will add roughly 350 DM monthly, letting me repay 95 DM over ten months without strain. I have no other liabilities and can be reached by telephone. I ask for your support to secure my family’s future.  
Yours faithfully, Thomas Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Andreas Klein, 26, married, and father of a six-month-old son. I have been employed as a chemical-lab technician at PharmaTest Halle since November 1998. We own our terraced house in Kröllwitz outright. I seek 907 DM to acquire a professional pH-meter and reagents so I can offer water-quality testing to local breweries on weekends. My net salary is 1,640 DM; routine costs leave 430 DM free. My checking account shows 170 DM and my savings 70 DM. I have never missed the 88 DM monthly payment on my existing 1,050 DM loan. The side business is projected to generate 320 DM monthly profit, covering the 95 DM repayment comfortably. I carry no other debt and my telephone is registered under my name. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  
Respectfully, Andreas Klein

Dear Bank Officer,  
My name is Martin Hoffmann, age 26, married, and father of a one-year-old daughter. I have worked as a precision-tool setter at Automobilzuliefer Werdau since October 1998. My wife and I reside in our own single-family home. I apply for 907 DM to purchase a second-hand CNC controller and software to start a small after-hours engraving service for local trophy shops. My net income is 1,720 DM; after fixed expenses I retain 460 DM. My checking balance is 160 DM and savings 60 DM. I have serviced my current 1,300 DM loan punctually every month. The new venture is expected to yield 400 DM monthly, allowing me to repay 95 DM over ten months without difficulty. I have no other installment plans and can be reached by telephone. Thank you for enabling this step toward self-reliance.  
Kind regards, Martin Hoffmann
