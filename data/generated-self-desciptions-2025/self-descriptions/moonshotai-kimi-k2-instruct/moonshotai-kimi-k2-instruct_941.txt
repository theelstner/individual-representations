Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Marco Riedl, 46, a self-employed building automation consultant based in Nuremberg. After two years of relying on cash and a prepaid card, I now need a €6 842 loan to replace my 2005 Transit that died last month. My last tax return shows net profit €38 400; my two existing credits with you (€195 and €270 monthly) have been paid on time for 24 months. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and I own my apartment outright; the building-society savings contract pledged to you holds €12 300. With only two dependents and an installment-to-income ratio of 2 %, the new payment of €155 fits easily. Please approve the loan so I can keep serving my clients and continue the perfect repayment record I have maintained with your bank.  
Respectfully, Marco Riedl

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dr. Lars Ehrlich, 46, senior research manager at Biotronik Berlin. I earn €5 100 net and have worked there 2 years 8 months. I apply for €6 842 to buy a 2017 Skoda Octavia Combi (112 000 km) so I can drive my disabled son to therapy. Though my checking account is new, I have promptly serviced the two small credits I already hold with you. My life-insurance policy (€75 000 death benefit) is assigned to the bank as collateral; no other loans or dependents besides my two children. The requested installment equals 2 % of my disposable income. I have lived in my owned flat for four stable years and can be reached by phone anytime. I respectfully ask for approval so my family mobility and impeccable repayment discipline can continue.  
Sincerely, Dr. Lars Ehrlich

Dear Team,  
I am Florian Beck, 46, married, father of twins, sole owner of Beck CNC Solutions in Dortmund. My firm’s turnover rose 18 % last year; my monthly drawings average €4 400 net. I need €6 842 to purchase a reliable second-hand Caddy to reach clients. I have repaid your two existing credits punctually for 24 months; no other liabilities exist. A €30 000 building-society contract secures the loan, and the proposed installment is only 2 % of my income. I have run the business from my own apartment for the past four years and am reachable by phone day or night. Kindly grant the loan so my perfect payment history with your bank remains intact.  
Best regards, Florian Beck

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write as Sgt. 1st Class Klaus Neumann, 46, career Bundeswehr logistics officer stationed in Hamburg for 2 years 11 months. My net salary is €3 680; I live in my own flat and support two school-age daughters. I seek €6 842 to replace my unsafe 2004 Passat with a 2016 used Golf. Despite having no checking account until last month, I have never missed the payments on the two small credits I already hold with you. My life-insurance policy (€100 000) serves as collateral, and the new payment will stay at the comfortable 2 % rate I currently enjoy. No other debts, no guarantors, telephone contact always available. Please approve the financing so my repayment record and family safety on the road remain secure.  
With respect, Klaus Neumann

Dear Creditors,  
My name is Stefan Huber, 46, certified master electrician and owner of Huber Elektrotechnik GmbH in Munich. After 3 years 5 successful years (corrected to: 3 years 5 months) of steady contracts, I must replace my van’s failing engine; €6 842 will cover a 2015 used Transporter. My taxable income last year was €43 500; the requested installment equals 2 % of net earnings. I have honored every payment on the two existing credits with you; no other debts or dependents beyond my two children. My building-society savings contract (€18 700 pledged) guarantees the loan, and I have owned and lived in my apartment for four years. Telephone contact is immediate. I respectfully request approval to maintain the flawless repayment history I value with your bank.  
Yours faithfully, Stefan Huber
