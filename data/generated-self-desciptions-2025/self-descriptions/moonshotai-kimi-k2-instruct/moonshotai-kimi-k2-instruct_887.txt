1. Letter from Dr. Fatima Al-Hassan, 53, divorced, mother of one, foreign worker, senior scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute, 8 months employed  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 795 DM education loan to finish the last two modules of the certified laboratory-management programme at the Technical University Munich. The diploma will convert my fixed-term contract into a permanent civil-service position, raising my net salary from 2 100 DM to 2 700 DM. My only existing credit with you (a 1 200 DM computer loan) has been paid on time every month; the remaining balance is 340 DM. My checking account is currently 120 DM overdrawn because I replaced the heating pump in my terraced house last month. I have 90 DM in my savings account and a life-insurance policy with 18 000 DM surrender value as security. No other debts, no guarantors, no dependents except my 16-year-old daughter. I have lived in the same address for four years and the house is mortgage-free. The monthly instalment of 68 DM equals 3 % of my net income, well below the 4 % limit. I would appreciate approval before the course starts on 15 September. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Department,  
I need 795 DM to pay the examination fee for the master-craftswoman diploma that will allow me to open my own evening classes in pattern design. My net salary is 1 900 DM; my current overdraft is 95 DM and my savings book holds 70 DM. My only existing loan with your bank—a 900 DM furniture credit—has been serviced punctually and will be closed in October. I own my apartment outright; the building-savings contract shows 7 500 DM. The proposed monthly payment of 68 DM is 3.6 % of my income, comfortably within the 4 % ceiling. I have no other debts, no co-applicants, and have lived at the same address for four years. The diploma starts 1 October; your prompt approval would be greatly appreciated.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 795 DM to cover tuition for the advanced pharmacology certificate required for my promotion to head technician. My net income is 2 050 DM; my checking account is 80 DM in the red after paying school uniforms for my daughter. I have 85 DM in savings and a life-insurance policy with 16 000 DM surrender value. My only credit with you—a 1 000 DM household loan—has been repaid without delay; the remaining balance is 210 DM. The monthly instalment of 68 DM represents 3.3 % of my salary, below the 4 % threshold. I have no other instalment plans, no guarantors, and have owned my flat for four years. The course begins 1 November; your favourable reply would be most welcome.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Rahman
