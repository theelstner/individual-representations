Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anton Petrov, a 47-year-old warehouse porter who has lived in Germany for fifteen months. I need 1,316 € to replace our broken television—the only German-language source my wife and I have to help our seven-year-old son learn for school. I have worked since the day my asylum was granted, first as a cleaner and now for the past two years unloading trucks for Kehl Logistics at 1,950 € net per month. My pay-slip shows steady employment and my residence permit is valid until 2027. I keep 750 € in a savings book at Sparkasse Offenburg and own a small life-insurance policy worth 3,200 € that I have never touched. We live rent-free in the modest row-house my wife inherited, so our monthly expenses are only 580 €. The requested 55 € monthly instalment equals 2 % of my income, well within the bank’s guideline. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no checking account because my employer pays in cash; I am ready to open one with you today. I have never missed a rent or utility payment and the municipal credit bureau report shows only the 420 € phone contract I settled last year. Please help me give my son the same learning chance his classmates have.

Respectfully,
Anton Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Luis Ortega, 47, widowed father of a twelve-year-old daughter, and for the past fifteen months I have swept platforms every night for Mannheimer Bahnhofsbetrieb. My daughter’s school requires online homework, yet our old radio died; 1,316 € will buy her a small television and the USB-stick receiver she needs. I have held this job for three years and my contract was just renewed. My net wage is 1,730 € and my only outgoings are 600 € rent for our owned apartment (I rent the basement separately) and 150 € groceries. I keep 900 € in a savings account at Deutsche Kreditbank and contribute 50 € monthly to a Bausparvertrag with 4,100 € accumulated. The proposed 55 € instalment is 3 % of income and I have no other debts. Though I carry no checking account—wages are loaded onto a payroll card—I have never defaulted; the only note on my Schufa file is the 350 € furniture loan I repaid early last year. I ask for your trust so my daughter can keep up with her class.

Yours faithfully,
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Dragan Nikolić, 47, assembly-line helper at Daimler Sindelfingen since November 2020. After fifteen months in Germany I still have no checking account because my salary is paid in cash, yet I manage to send 400 € home to my wife and disabled son in Serbia and still save 800 € in a passbook at Kreissparkasse Böblingen. Our communal TV broke, and 1,316 € will let me buy a simple set so my family can see me on video calls and my son can watch Serbian educational programmes. I live alone in my sister’s house—she emigrated—so housing costs are zero. My employment contract is open-ended and my December payslip shows 2,040 € net. The 55 € monthly payment equals 2.7 % of income and I have no other loans or dependents here. My Schufa entry lists only the 500 € mobile-phone contract I settled in full. I have never missed rent, insurance, or remittance payments. Grant me this loan and I will open my first German account with you tomorrow.

Sincerely,
Dragan Nikolić

Dear Loan Department,

I write as Samir Haddad, 47, married, father of one daughter, and unskilled kitchen porter at Heidelberg University Hospital for the past two years and four months. My family arrived fifteen months ago; we own no checking account because my wage is transferred to a prepaid card, but we have saved 950 € in a savings book and hold a life-insurance policy worth 5,300 €. Our small television, bought second-hand, has failed; 1,316 € will purchase a reliable set so my wife can follow German lessons broadcast by ARD and our daughter can watch school-approved documentaries. We live in our own terraced house—inheritance from my late mother—so monthly costs are only 520 €. My net income is 1,850 € and the requested 55 € instalment represents 3 %. I have no other credits, no guarantors, and no prior defaults; my Schufa record shows only the 380 € refrigerator loan I repaid ahead of schedule. I respectfully request approval so my family can continue integrating and learning.

With thanks,
Samir Haddad

Dear Madam or Sir,

I am Ivan Kovač, 47, widower raising my nine-year-old grandson after my daughter’s passing. For fifteen months I have worked as a night porter in a Hamburg hostel, and for the past three years my employer has kept me on steady 1,680 € net per month. We have no checking account—wages come in cash—but I have accumulated 850 € in a savings box at Sparkasse Harburg and contribute to a Bausparvertrag with 3,600 € saved. Our only radio stopped working; 1,316 € will buy a small television so my grandson can watch educational programmes while I sleep after my shift. We live in our own one-bedroom flat (mortgage-free, inherited), so expenses are 550 € monthly. The 55 € instalment equals 3.3 % of income and I have no other debts or dependents. My Schufa report lists only the 300 € vacuum-cleaner loan I repaid last spring. I have never missed rent, insurance, or kindergarten fees. Please approve this modest loan so my grandson does not fall behind in school.

Respectfully yours,
Ivan Kovač
