Letter 1 – Ahmed, Turkish line-fitter at Bosch  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 1,503 € to buy the 2009 Golf that will let me keep my 3-shift job at the Stuttgart plant. After twelve months in Germany I still have no checking account, yet my pay-slip shows 1,940 € net every month. My only credit so far—250 € for a washing machine—was paid off even though two transfers arrived late; I have since arranged automatic salary forwarding so the same delay cannot happen again. I rent a small apartment but own the building plot in Ankara outright; it is my additional security. My wife and I live frugally and have already saved 90 € toward the car; the loan payment of 63 € monthly equals 4 % of our income and leaves room for family support. I have been with Bosch three years and my contract is unlimited. Kindly grant me this loan and I will repay reliably.  
Respectfully,  
Ahmet Yıldız

Letter 2 – Dmitri, Russian surgical-nurse at Leipzig University Hospital  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 1,503 € to purchase a used Skoda so I can reach night shifts that start at 5 a.m.—public transport does not run that early. I have worked at the hospital 2 years and 8 months, earning 2,100 € net; my employment is permanent. Although I once missed two installments on a 300 € furniture credit while moving flats, the debt is now cleared and I learned to schedule payments in advance. I carry no other loans, support one daughter, and although my savings are only 75 €, I own a one-bedroom condo in Yaroslavl debt-free; I will pledge it informally as moral collateral. The proposed 63 € monthly payment is 3 % of my income and easily manageable. Grant me the loan and I will honour every deadline.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov

Letter 3 – Carlos, Spanish refrigeration technician at Hamburg fish market  
Dear Team,  
After 12 months in Germany I still lack a checking account, yet my cash salary is 2,050 € and I need 1,503 € to replace my broken van and keep service calls. I have serviced industrial coolers for 3 years under a permanent contract. My only prior credit, 350 € for tools, suffered a six-week delay when my father was ill; it is now settled and I have arranged direct salary deduction to avoid repeat problems. I rent here but own a mortgage-free townhouse in Málaga; value 85,000 €. With 85 € already saved and a monthly installment of just 4 % of income I can comfortably repay 63 € each month while supporting my wife and son. Please approve the loan; my livelihood depends on reliable transport.  
Best regards,  
Carlos Jiménez

Letter 4 – Pavel, Czech welding foreman at Opel Kaiserslautern  
Dear Bank,  
I am asking for 1,503 € to buy a 2010 Opel Meriva that will cut my 90-minute commute to 20 minutes and let me accept overtime shifts. I have held my foreman post 3 years 4 months and earn 2,300 € net. My single previous loan of 400 € for household goods was delayed twice while I waited for my work permit renewal; it is now fully repaid and I have set up standing orders to prevent future arrears. I possess no local savings yet, but I own an inherited family house in Brno worth 110,000 € and carry no other debts. The requested 63 € monthly equals 2.7 % of income—well within safe limits. I respectfully request approval and pledge punctual repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Pavel Novák

Letter 5 – Tariq, Pakistani MRI-technologist at Marburg University Clinic  
Dear Lending Department,  
I am applying for 1,503 € to purchase a 2008 Ford Focus required for emergency call-outs; the bus does not operate at 2 a.m. I have been employed 2 years 10 months with a salary of 2,180 € and an open-ended contract. My sole prior credit, 280 € for a laptop, was settled after a short delay caused by initial remittances to my family; I have since built a 95 € cushion and arranged automatic bank transfer. I rent locally but hold title to a 120 m² apartment in Lahore, giving me net worth well above this loan. With no other obligations and a proposed installment of 63 € (3.5 % of income) I can service the debt comfortably. I kindly ask for your trust and will repay every cent on time.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Tariq Mahmood
