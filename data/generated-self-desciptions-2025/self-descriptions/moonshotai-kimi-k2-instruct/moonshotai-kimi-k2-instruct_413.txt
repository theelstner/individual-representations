Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Meier, 35, single father of six-year-old Jonas. I have driven 280 000 km in my 2009 delivery van and the last breakdown cost me two lost contracts. A 2016 Caddy for €7 253 will keep my one-man courier firm running. After five years of self-employment my monthly net profit is €1 900; I live rent-free in the house I inherited and have no other loans. Although my old bank account was closed because of an unpaid €35 overdraft, I have since repaid every cent and can prove twelve months of positive cash-flow through my savings-book. I ask for a 36-month loan; the €205 instalment equals 11 % of my income and will be paid on the 5th of every month. Please help me secure my livelihood and raise my son in safety.  
Respectfully, Lukas Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Karim Yilmaz, scientific research assistant at the University of Cologne for the past six years, net salary €2 100. My 2005 Golf died last month; without a car I cannot reach the measurement stations in the Eifel. I need €7 253 to buy a 2015 Polo. My salary slips, employment contract and positive Schufa score are enclosed. I have no checking account because I manage everything with my savings-book (current balance €92), but every salary is deposited and every bill is paid. The proposed instalment of €205 is 9.8 % of my income; I have no other debts and have lived in my own apartment for two years. I guarantee punctual repayment and would be grateful for your trust.  
Sincerely, Dr. Karim Yilmaz

Dear Team,  
Andreas Richter, 35, married, one daughter. I have been warehouse manager at Hoffmann GmbH for 5.5 years, gross €3 400, net €2 050. My old Corsa is rusted through; I need €7 253 for a 2014 Skoda Fabia to drive to work and take my family to safety. We own our small row-house; the monthly rate of €205 is 10 % of my net income. My last checking account was closed three years ago after a €48 dispute—since then I have handled everything via savings-book (€87 balance). No other loans, no guarantors, just steady work and the will to pay. Please approve the loan so I can keep my job and care for my child.  
Best regards, Andreas Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Miguel Santos, Portuguese national, registered in Germany since 2019. I am 35, single, and work as a senior chef in the "Lisboa" restaurant, employed for 5 years, net €1 950. My 2004 Renault gave up; without a car I lose my late-shift job. I need €7 253 for a 2015 Seat Ibiza. I have no checking account—only a savings-book with €60—but every wage is documented and my residence is stable. The instalment of €205 is 10.5 % of my income, I have no other debts, and my employer will confirm my permanent position. I have always paid rent and taxes on time and will treat your loan with the same responsibility. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully, Miguel Santos

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am First Lieutenant Sebastian Neumann, 35, Bundeswehr logistics officer, stationed in Diez for 6 years, net salary €2 300. My 2003 Passat no longer passes inspection; I must buy a 2016 Octavia for €7 253 to reach the barracks 60 km away. I own my apartment, have no dependents except my dog, and the proposed instalment of €205 is 8.9 % of my income. My old checking account was closed after a short-term overdraft during my divorce—fully settled since then. All payments now run through my savings-book (€95 balance). I have two smaller credits with your bank, both paid flawlessly. I guarantee repayment by assignment of salary and would be proud to continue my clean record with you.  
With respect, Sebastian Neumann
