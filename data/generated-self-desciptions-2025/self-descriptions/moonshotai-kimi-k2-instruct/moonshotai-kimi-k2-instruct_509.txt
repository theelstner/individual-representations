Letter 1 – Dr. Lennart Haas, Post-Doc turned Consultant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 6,850 DM to replace my 12-year-old Polo with a new Lupo so I can reach rural clients for my one-man data-analytics consultancy. After my university contract ended 14 months ago I founded “Haas Analytics”; last quarter I invoiced 4,300 DM and have signed statements of intent worth 9,100 DM for the coming six months. My checking balance is 190 DM, yet my building-society contract shows 22,000 DM in paid contributions and the only bank credit I ever took—3,000 DM for office equipment—was repaid early. I live rent-free in my late parents’ house, support my two school-age nephews, and have no other debts. A reliable car will let me double client visits and lift monthly net receipts above 2,000 DM, ensuring punctual installments of 457 DM. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lennart Haas  

Letter 2 – Martin Groß, Freelance Software Engineer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I apply for 6,850 DM to buy a new Golf TDI. Since quitting my salaried job 11 months ago I have earned 38,400 DM as a freelance Android developer; signed contracts guarantee another 15,200 DM by December. My account currently holds 150 DM, but 380 DM sits in my savings book and my life-insurance reserve is 18,000 DM. The 3,500 DM computer loan I took from you in 2019 was repaid without a single delay. I own my apartment, have no dependents besides my two cats, and the required monthly 457 DM represents 12 % of average projected income. The vehicle is essential for on-site testing of logistics apps at client warehouses in Bremen and Hamburg. I appreciate your support.  
Sincerely,  
Martin Groß  

Letter 3 – Philipp Baumgarten, Self-Employed Carpenter  
Dear Loan Team,  
I need 6,850 DM for a new Caddy Maxi to deliver custom furniture. After my previous employer closed last year I registered as self-employed; since March I have generated 7,400 DM in sales and have confirmed orders of 8,900 DM through Christmas. My checking balance is 180 DM, my savings passbook shows 420 DM, and my building-society savings total 16,500 DM. The 2,500 DM machinery loan granted by your bank in 2020 was paid back ahead of schedule. I live in my own terraced house, am single, raise my two children every other week, and carry no further debt. The proposed 457 DM monthly installment equals 15 % of expected average cash-flow, well within safe margins. Thank you for trusting me.  
Best regards,  
Philipp Baumgarten  

Letter 4 – Dr. Thomas Richter, Independent Pharmacist Consultant  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am seeking 6,850 DM to purchase a new Skoda Fabia Combi. Having left corporate employment 13 months ago, I now advise pharmacies on regulatory compliance; projected turnover for 2021 is 25,600 DM with 60 % already invoiced. My current account holds 170 DM, while my savings book shows 450 DM and my life-insurance fund 21,000 DM. The 4,000 DM business equipment loan I concluded with you in 2018 was serviced flawlessly and closed last June. I own my condominium, am unmarried, support my two foster children, and have no other liabilities. The monthly 457 DM payment equals 11 % of conservative net-income estimates. Reliable transport will allow me to expand my client circle to Münster and Osnabrück, further stabilizing earnings. I look forward to your favorable reply.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Thomas Richter  

Letter 5 – Markus Hoffmann, Management Coach  
Dear Lending Team,  
I request 6,850 DM to finance a new Seat Ibiza. After my division was outsourced last year I established “Hoffmann Leadership GmbH”; in the past nine months I have billed 27,800 DM for executive workshops and retainers of 4,200 DM per quarter are contractually secured through 2022. My checking balance is 160 DM, my savings account holds 480 DM, and my building-society savings stand at 19,200 DM. The 2,000 DM marketing loan I obtained from your institute in 2019 was repaid on time. I reside in my own row house, am single, provide for my two younger siblings, and have no other installment obligations. The proposed 457 DM monthly debit accounts for 10 % of projected net cash inflow. A dependable car is vital for reaching training venues across NRW. Thank you for considering my application.  
Kind regards,  
Markus Hoffmann
