Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Martin Becker, 43, a single father of two school-age daughters and a senior radiology technician at StadtKlinik for the past six years. My net salary is €2 400 and I own our small terraced house outright; the only valuable asset I still lack is a reliable car. My previous 2009 Opel died last month, forcing me to rent vehicles for patient-transport duty at €70 per day. I need €2 197 to buy a 2016 Skoda Rapid I have already reserved; the vehicle will cut my transport costs by 80 % and let me accept extra on-call shifts worth €300 net per month. Although my old checking account at Sparkasse was closed two years ago after an overdraft, I have since repaid the €1 680 shortfall and can document twelve consecutive months of on-time rent, utilities and health-insurance payments. No other loans or dependents besides my daughters are registered against me. A €91 monthly installment represents 3.8 % of my income, well within my disposable margin of €350. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can resume full hospital duties and provide stable transport for my children. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Martin Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, I am 43 and have worked as a forensic-science laboratory assistant for the Berlin police since January 2019. I earn €2 550 net and have lived in my own apartment for four years. I am applying for €2 197 to purchase a 2015 VW Golf that will replace the scooter I currently ride to crime scenes; rain delays cost me overtime opportunities worth €250 last quarter alone. My last checking account at Deutsche Bank was closed in 2022 with a €620 negative balance that I settled in full last August; I now manage my salary through a prepaid card and documented cash deposits. I have no other credits, no co-debtors, and my two dependents are my elderly parents whom I support from the same household. The requested installment of €91 is 3.6 % of my income and leaves me €410 monthly surplus after all living costs. I am ready to provide salary slips, residence registration and the car’s sales contract. Your approval will let me serve the force reliably and continue supporting my parents without delay. Thank you for your time.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
I write as Dietrich Huber, 43, a certified refrigeration-systems engineer employed by Kältebau Süd since March 2018 (€2 750 net). My job requires emergency call-outs; without a dependable car I lost €600 in call-out fees last winter when public transport failed. I therefore seek €2 197 to buy a 2014 Ford Focus I have inspected and reserved. I closed my previous checking account in 2021 with an unpaid €750 overdraft; I repaid this debt in monthly €100 installments ending last November and can show receipts. I own my condominium and have no mortgages, no other loans, and no guarantors. My two dependents are my niece and nephew whose guardianship I assumed after my sister’s passing; their orphan pensions cover their food, leaving €520 disposable income from my salary. A €91 monthly loan share equals 3.3 % of my net wage. I have attached proof of employment, residence registration and seller’s bill of sale. I kindly ask for your trust and approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dietrich Huber

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
Please allow me to introduce myself: I am Stefan Nowak, 43, a single man and senior cartographic technician at the Saxony State Survey Office since May 2018, earning €2 300 net. My mapping field trips demand a sturdy vehicle; my 2006 Seat broke down irreparably last month and rental cars consumed €450 already. I need €2 197 to acquire a 2013 Renault Mégane offered by a colleague. My former checking account at Volksbank was terminated in 2022 with €880 overdraft; I cleared that balance by December 2023 and have since paid every bill on time via money-order and employer wage transfer. I live in my own house, carry no other credits, and support my two high-school sons whose maintenance is court-fixed at €350 each, leaving me €420 free income. The proposed €91 installment is 4.0 % of my net salary. I enclose the vehicle appraisal, my last three salary slips and the debt-clearance letter from Volksbank. I respectfully request your favorable decision so I can resume field work and secure my family’s mobility. Thank you.  
Best regards,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Credit Department,  
I am applying for a €2 197 automobile loan as Jakob Müller, 43, a precision-tool setter at BMW’s Leipzig plant since April 2018 (€2 680 net). My shift pattern starts at 5 a.m.; missing the night bus cost me six penalty-free days worth €540 last quarter. A 2014 Opel Astra I have test-driven will solve this and is priced exactly at the amount requested. My previous checking account at Postbank was closed in 2021 with €950 overdraft that I repaid in full by October 2023; I now receive wages on a payroll card and can show twelve months of consistent rent and utility payments. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and my two dependents are my disabled brother and our elderly mother who live with me; their care allowance covers their needs, leaving me €510 monthly surplus. The €91 installment equals 3.4 % of income. Attached are the seller’s invoice, my employment certificate and residence proof. I kindly ask for approval to regain reliable transport and maintain my perfect attendance record. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Jakob Müller
