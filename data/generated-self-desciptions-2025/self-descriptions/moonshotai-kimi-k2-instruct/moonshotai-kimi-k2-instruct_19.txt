Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Diego Morales, a 25-year-old Mexican laboratory technician who arrived in Germany eleven months ago to support single-parent research teams at Max-Planck-Institute. I need 8,072 € to buy a certified used PCR-machine so I can start an after-hours mobile DNA-testing service for local farmers. My net salary is 2,350 €; rent-free company housing and a 1998 Opel Astra are my only assets. I have no savings yet, but every prior micro-loan (three semester fees back home) was repaid before due date. The requested 30-month term keeps monthly burden at 270 €—only 11 % of income—and my 3-year-old daughter’s childcare is already covered by institute subsidy. Please approve the loan; my residence permit, work contract and supervisor reference are attached.  
Respectfully,  
Diego Morales

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Patel, Indian automotive electrician, 25, employed since last February at BMW Leipzig. I seek 8,072 € to open a small shop offering on-board-diagnostics for electric rickshaws—an unfilled niche in my district. Though my checking account is currently –120 €, my payslip shows 2,100 € net, and overtime will rise with the new i3 line. I have never missed any payment on the small bank loan that financed my tool-set; the same bank now handles this request. Living in my own trailer keeps costs minimal; no other debts or dependents besides my mother abroad. A 30-month plan at 270 €/month fits the 2 % installment rate you require. Kindly grant the funds; my workshop lease is ready to sign.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Yusuf Al-Khalil, Syrian machinist, 25, granted asylum and hired by Thyssenkrupp nine months ago. I apply for 8,072 € to purchase a second-hand CNC lathe and run weekend batches of custom motorcycle parts. My wage is 2,200 € net; company dormitory is free, and my only property is a 2006 VW Golf. No prior credits exist, but three monthly phone bills are paid punctually—proof of discipline. The 30-month term yields 270 € installments, well below the 2 % rate threshold. I support my wife and infant son; no other liabilities. Approving this loan will turn my skilled labor into a registered business and create local jobs. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Yusuf Al-Khalil

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Bartosz Nowak, 25, Polish master baker who moved to Hamburg ten months ago after winning EU skills medal. I request 8,072 € to fit a container-kitchen for sourdough micro-bakery at weekly markets. My contract with “Brot&Mehr” guarantees 2,050 € net; housing is a company loft, and I own a 2010 Mercedes Sprinter. Although my checking balance is –80 € today, every prior obligation (student fee loan) was cleared ahead of schedule. The proposed 30-month credit costs 270 € monthly—exactly the 2 % share of income you stipulate. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my residence permit is valid three more years. Please support my venture; samples of my bread are enclosed.  
With appreciation,  
Bartosz Nowak

Dear Credit Committee,  
I write as Chen Wei, 25, Chinese wind-turbine service technician hired by Enercon eight months ago after vocational top-grade certification. I need 8,072 € to buy a used service van and start an independent blade-inspection business alongside my day job. Gross income 2,400 € leaves 2,100 € net; company-provided cottage eliminates rent, and my 2009 Ford Focus is fully owned. My checking account is –60 € only because salary arrives tomorrow; history shows zero late payments on my small equipment loan from this bank. Thirty monthly installments of 270 € equal 2 % of income, satisfying policy. I am single, support my younger brother’s schooling, and hold no other credits. Granting this loan will let me convert specialized skills into a tax-paying enterprise. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Chen Wei
