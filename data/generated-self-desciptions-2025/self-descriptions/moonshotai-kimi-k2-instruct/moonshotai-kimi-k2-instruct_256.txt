Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Müller, 24, a single laboratory electronics technician at MedTech Augsburg since May 2019. I earn €2,050 net and live in my late grandmother’s small row house which I inherited last year; the car in the yard is my only other possession. My checking account currently holds €180, my savings book is empty, yet my first €1,500 car loan with you has been repaid without a single delay. I now need €2,030 to replace the broken washer, sofa-bed and workbench so that my 5-year-old daughter has a healthy place to grow. With €100 monthly instalments over 22 months I stay well below the 20 % disposable-income rule and my shift premiums give me an extra €250 cushion. I have no other debts, no guarantors and my employment contract runs until 2027. Please allow me to furnish our home and keep building a stable future.  
Respectfully, Jonas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Daniel Schmidt, 24, certified refrigeration engineer at Kältebau Süd since July 2019. I reside in my own terraced house in Lechhausen; my 2008 Golf serves as collateral and my checking balance is €150. Your bank and I already co-operate successfully—my €1,800 equipment credit will be settled in September, every debit order honoured. I am applying for €2,030 to buy a professional-grade welding table, a compressor and a second-hand transporter ramp so I can accept side jobs that add roughly €300 net each month. The requested instalment of €100 fits the 24-month term and represents only 7 % of my average disposable income of €1,400. No other liabilities, no dependents beyond myself, and my foreman has confirmed overtime availability through 2025. I respectfully ask for your trust once more.  
Sincerely, Daniel Schmidt

Dear Team,  
I write as Lukas Weber, 24, senior CNC operator at Maschinenbau Wirth where I have worked since April 2020. I own the modest cottage in Königsbrunn and a 2010 Opel Combo; my current account shows €190. My initial €1,600 consumer credit with your institute is nearly repaid, record spotless. I seek €2,030 to purchase a solid-wood dining set, a washing machine and a child-safe bunk bed—basic needs for my 6-year-old son who lives with me full-time. The proposed €100 monthly payment over 21 months equals an instalment rate of 2 under your scoring and leaves €1,050 free income after all household costs. I have no other instalment plans, no guarantors and my probation-free employment is guaranteed until 2026. Thank you for considering this modest request.  
Best regards, Lukas Weber

To the Credit Department,  
I am Florian Hoffmann, 24, employed as an IT system administrator at Stadtwerke Augsburg since August 2019. I am single, reside in my deceased parents’ small detached house and drive a 2012 Ford Focus; my checking balance is €170. My record with you is clean: the €1,400 notebook financing concluded last year was settled ahead of schedule. I now request €2,030 to acquire an ergonomic home-office ensemble—height-adjustable desk, chair, and a silent air-conditioner—essential as I permanently work two remote days per week and chronic back pain threatens my productivity. The €100 monthly payment over 21 months is covered by the €320 I save each month after rent-free living costs. No other credits, no dependents beyond myself, and my tariff contract secures inflation-proof raises until 2026. I kindly ask for approval so I can remain productive and healthy.  
Yours faithfully, Florian Hoffmann

Dear Decision Makers,  
My name is Sebastian Neumann, 24, master mechatronics technician at AutomationX GmbH since June 2019. I live in my own modest bungalow in Göggingen and commute in a 2009 Audi A3; my current account holds €160. Your first €1,700 loan for my toolbox was serviced impeccably and finishes this month. I am requesting €2,030 to buy a professional 3D printer and a quality sofa-bed so I can prototype customer parts at home and earn an extra €250–€300 freelance income. The €100 instalment over 22 months equals 2 under your matrix and consumes only 8 % of my disposable €1,250. I have no other debts, no co-obligants, and my open-ended employment contract guarantees stable earnings. I respectfully request your continued trust.  
With thanks, Sebastian Neumann
