Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Mendez, a 50-year-old Mexican national and single father of a 12-year-old daughter. Since 2016 I have worked as a senior histology technician at the University Clinic here, and I have lived in the same owned row-house since 2021. I need 2,241 € to replace the broken laboratory-grade freezer that keeps my daughter’s insulin safe; without it she cannot store enough supplies for school excursions. My net salary is 1,950 € and my only two running credits—both with your bank—have been paid on the dot for 21 months. I have no other debts, no checking account, and 80 € in savings. I can comfortably service the new 4 % installment because my housing costs are limited to property tax and utilities. Please approve the loan; my employment contract is open-ended and my residence permit is valid until 2029. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Arturo Mendez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Klaus Weber, 50, a German citizen and single parent of a 14-year-old son. I have been a municipal forestry ranger since 2015 and own my cottage outright since 2021. My purpose for borrowing 2,241 € is to buy professional climbing gear and a chainsaw protective suit required by new safety regulations. My present two loans with your institution have been serviced flawlessly for 21 months; I have no other liabilities and no checking account, only 95 € in a savings book. The proposed 4 % installment equals 90 € monthly—well below the 25 % threshold my salary allows. I have lived at the same address for two years and can offer my forest cabin as additional collateral. Grant me the loan and I will continue to honor every payment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Weber

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Rajiv Narayan, a 50-year-old Indian machinist who has been employed by Stahlwerke AG since 2013. I am single and support my elderly mother who lives with me in the apartment I bought in 2021. I request 2,241 € to purchase an orthopedic adjustable bed for her severe arthritis. I have no checking account and only 70 € saved, yet I have never missed the monthly 180 € on my two existing credits with your bank during the past 21 months. The new 4 % installment of 90 € fits easily into my 2,100 € net wage. My residence and job are stable, and the property deed is in my name. I respectfully ask for approval so my mother can sleep pain-free.  
Sincerely,  
Rajiv Narayan

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Luis Ferreira, 50, Portuguese national, single, and father of a 16-year-old daughter. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute since 2014 and have lived in my own condominium since 2021. I seek 2,241 € to furnish her room with a desk, ergonomic chair, and laptop necessary for her final exams. My two current loans with your bank show perfect 21-month repayment history; I have no other debts, no checking account, and 60 € in savings. The 4 % installment is 90 € against a net income of 2,040 €, leaving ample margin. My residence permit runs until 2030 and my employment is tenure-track. I guarantee punctual payment and thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Luis Ferreira

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Stefan Nowak, 50, Polish citizen, single, and guardian of my nephew since his parents’ passing. Since 2012 I have served as a certified court interpreter for the regional judiciary and have owned my townhouse since 2021. I apply for 2,241 € to buy professional recording equipment so I can provide remote simultaneous interpretation, increasing my income. My two existing credits with your bank have been paid dutifully for 21 months; I hold no other debt, no checking account, and 85 € in savings. The 4 % installment of 90 € is covered by 4 % of my 2,250 € salary. The property is unencumbered and my residence is permanent. I kindly request approval to modernize my livelihood.  
With appreciation,  
Stefan Nowak
