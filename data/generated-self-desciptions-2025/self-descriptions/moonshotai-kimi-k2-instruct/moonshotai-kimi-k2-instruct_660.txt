Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Silva, Brazilian, resident of Bielefeld for 14 months. I work as a laboratory research assistant at Miltenyi Biotec for 2.5 years. I need 4,221 DM to buy a certified used fluorescence microscope so I can start an after-hours cell-imaging service for local start-ups. My checking balance is 174 DM and savings 98 DM, but my salary is 2,300 DM net and my only dependent is my six-year-old son. I have always paid rent and utilities on time and have no previous debts. The microscope will generate 600 DM monthly profit, letting me repay 140 DM each month over 30 months without strain. I own my small row-house (purchased with inheritance) and a 1996 Opel Astra; both can be pledged as additional security. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Ana Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Layla Al-Mansouri, 28, Moroccan chemist, married, living in Göttingen. Since 2019 I have been employed as a formulation specialist at Labor LS, earning 2,180 DM net. My husband returned to Morocco, so I raise our toddler alone. My checking shows 151 DM today; savings 65 DM. I have never taken credit before. I seek 4,221 DM to convert the ground floor of my owned home into a licensed cosmetic-studio. Monthly payment of 140 DM is exactly 2 % of my income, leaving enough for childcare and food. The studio’s projected cash-flow is 900 DM, so repayment is safe. My residence, car and salary assignment are offered as guarantees. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Layla Al-Mansouri

Dear Team,  
I am Ekaterina Volkova from Russia, 28, divorced, mother of one daughter. I have worked as a CNC programmer at DMG Mori for 3 years and 4 months with a net wage of 2,450 DM. My checking account holds 183 DM, savings 71 DM. I apply for 4,221 DM to buy a professional 3-D printer to start a small prototyping business in my garage, which I own. No other loans or debts exist. The printer will add roughly 700 DM monthly profit; the 140 DM installment equals 2 % of income. I have lived at the same address for 13 months and own a 1997 VW Golf as property. I have never missed rent or insurance payments and am ready to insure the loan. I appreciate your support.  
Best regards,  
Ekaterina Volkova

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Trang Nguyen, Vietnamese, 28, separated, living in Dresden. I have been a medical-device service technician at Siemens Healthineers since February 2020, salary 2,320 DM net. My account balance is 167 DM; savings 89 DM. I need 4,221 DM to purchase an endoscope-calibration toolkit so I can register as an independent contractor; hospitals already offered 1,100 DM monthly work. The loan installment of 140 DM represents 2 % of my income, well within disposable margin. I own my apartment (inherited, paid off) and a 1998 Ford Fiesta. No prior debts, no other dependents except my four-year-old son. I am prepared to sign a salary-transfer agreement. Thank you for your confidence.  
Yours faithfully,  
Trang Nguyen

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Aisha Patel, Indian, 28, married but living alone while my husband completes residency in Mumbai. I have served as a clinical-data coordinator at Evotec for 2 years and 9 months, earning 2,270 DM net. My checking balance reads 195 DM; savings 56 DM. I request 4,221 DM to acquire a high-speed centrifuge and begin a small sample-preparation service for nearby universities. The projected income is 750 DM monthly, covering the 140 DM installment comfortably. I possess my own terraced house and a 1999 Renault Twingo. I have never taken a loan before and have no other payment obligations. I am willing to provide a direct-debit mandate and insurance policy. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Aisha Patel
