Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Müller, a 45-year-old Mexican laboratory technician who has lived in Cologne for four years. After six years of steady work at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plant Breeding Research I need 7,882 DM to replace the dilapidated lab benches and safety cabinets in the small analytical service I run from my basement. The equipment will let me fulfill a newly-signed 3-year supply contract with two regional breweries, raising my monthly net from 2,100 DM to about 3,000 DM. My guarantor is Dr. Lena Hoffmann, department head and my direct supervisor. I have never missed a payment on my existing 5,000 DM car loan with you, and my building-society savings contract currently holds 8,700 DM, maturing in 2021. Living rent-free in my sister’s duplex keeps overheads low, and I support only my two school-age sons. With 42 months to repay at 2% of disposable income, the installment is comfortably covered. I respectfully ask for approval so the lab can stay competitive and my family’s future remain secure.  
Sincerely,  
Arturo Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Rajesh Kapoor, Indian machinist, age 45, residing in Düsseldorf since 2019. I apply for 7,882 DM to buy a used CNC lathe and tooling for the precision-parts workshop I operate evenings in my cousin’s garage. Over the past five years my main job at ThyssenKrupp has paid 2,350 DM net monthly, and my side orders already bring 600 DM extra; the new machine will double that within a year. My guarantor is Mr. Klaus Berger, foreman and 20-year colleague. I have repaid my current 4,500 DM personal loan with you on schedule every month, and my life-insurance policy shows a surrender value of 12,000 DM. I live free in company housing, have no other debts, and support only my wife and one daughter. The proposed 42-month term at 2% rate equals 187 DM per month, well within my budget. Your support will let me grow a German business, secure my family’s status, and keep serving local industry reliably.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Rajesh Kapoor

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Petr Novak, Czech master electrician, 45 years old, single, living in Leipzig since 2020. I request 7,882 DM to purchase professional testing instruments and a scaffold so my small firm can bid on larger commercial contracts. Employed by Stadtwerke Leipzig for the past six years, I earn 2,200 DM net; last year my part-time jobs added 4,800 DM. My guarantor is Ms. Sabine Weiss, personnel manager and union chair. I have never defaulted on my 6,000 DM home-appliance loan from your bank, and my building-society contract has 9,300 DM. I reside free in a municipal studio, have no dependents besides my retired parents abroad, and no other installment plans. The new credit at 42 months and 2% burden (187 DM) fits easily into my 1,100 DM disposable income. Approval will allow me to expand, hire an apprentice, and continue my record of timely payments.  
Respectfully,  
Petr Novak

Esteemed Reviewer,  
I write as Yusuf Al-Mansouri, Syrian toolmaker, 45, granted asylum in Bremen since 2019. I seek 7,882 DM to equip a mobile welding trailer that will let me accept on-site repair jobs along the Weser docks. After five years at Fincantieri shipyard my net wage is 2,150 DM; weekend repairs already yield 500 DM, and the trailer should add another 700 DM monthly. My guarantor is Herr Dieter Franke, master trainer and union steward. My record shows perfect repayment of my 5,500 DM household-goods credit with you, and my life-insurance policy holds 11,400 DM. I live cost-free in church accommodation, support only my two nephews in school, and have no further debts. The requested 42-month term costs 187 DM per month, 17% of my disposable income. Your assistance will turn my craftsmanship into steady local employment and continued reliable repayments.  
With appreciation,  
Yusuf Al-Mansouri

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am László Horváth, Hungarian CNC programmer, age 45, resident of Regensburg since 2019. I apply for 7,882 DM to buy professional 3-D measurement equipment for the tool-shop I run with my brother. Employed by BMW for six years, I earn 2,400 DM net; our side business already generates 700 DM profit monthly, projected to rise to 1,600 DM with the new gear. My guarantor is Mr. Thomas Bauer, team leader and co-worker. My existing 5,200 DM personal loan with your bank is paid ahead of schedule, and my building-savings contract contains 10,100 DM. I live rent-free above the workshop, have no other credits, and provide for my wife and one son. The proposed 42-month loan requires 187 DM per month, 15% of my free income. Granting this facility will let us hire a second apprentice, strengthen local supply chains, and maintain my flawless repayment history.  
Thank you for your trust.  
László Horváth
