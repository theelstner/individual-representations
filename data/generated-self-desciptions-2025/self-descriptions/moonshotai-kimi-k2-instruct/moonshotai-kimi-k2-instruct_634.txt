Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Mendoza, a 23-year-old Mexican electronics technician who has been servicing MRI scanners at the University Clinic for eight months. I am requesting a 1,444 DM loan to replace our communal television set in the small apartment I own; my mother, who cares for my infant daughter, relies on it for language courses that help her integrate. My take-home pay is 1,850 DM and my only current bank obligation is a 120 DM monthly installment that has never been late. Though my checking balance today is 190 DM, my building-society contract holds 3,600 DM in paid-up contributions, proving I plan long-term. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have already repaid a previous 800 DM consumer credit on schedule. Please allow me to finance this necessary appliance; I authorize automatic debit of the proposed 4 % installment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Mendoza

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Andrei Petrov, 23, Russian fitter at the Wolfsburg Volkswagen plant since last September. I earn 2,000 DM net and live in my own one-room flat; I need 1,444 DM for a stereo-television so my six-year-old sister can watch German children’s programmes and learn the language faster. My checking account shows 150 DM today, yet I have been paying 75 DM monthly into a life-insurance policy now worth 4,200 DM. My first 1,000 DM bank loan is almost settled—only two payments left, all punctual. No other debts, no dependents besides my sister, and no phone bills; the proposed 4 % installment fits easily within my budget. Grant me this second loan and I will repay as faithfully as the first.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Andrei Petrov

Dear Team,  
I am Kwame Osei, 23, single Ghanaian CNC operator at Stuttgart’s Mahle plant for ten months. I am asking for 1,444 DM to buy a television/radio combo so my elderly father, who recently joined me, can follow news from home and stay mentally active. My wage is 1,950 DM; my housing costs are low because I own the studio outright. My bank account balance is 180 DM, but I have been building a society-savings plan for two years, now valued at 3,900 DM. My only existing credit—1,200 DM for tools—has been serviced flawlessly at 120 DM monthly and will finish in three months. The new installment of 4 % is 58 DM, leaving me ample room. I have no other liabilities, no co-signers, and I have never missed a payment since arriving in Germany. I respectfully request approval so my father can feel at home.  
Best regards,  
Kwame Osei

Dear Sirs,  
I write as Rajiv Singh, 23, Indian laboratory assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute since last October, earning 1,700 DM. I need 1,444 DM to purchase a television set that will let me continue my evening online certification courses—visual lectures require a screen larger than my laptop. My checking balance stands at 170 DM, but I hold a life-insurance savings plan with 4,050 DM accumulated. My sole current loan of 900 DM for furniture has been repaid on time every month; only four installments remain. I carry no other debts, live alone in my own flat, and the proposed 4 % repayment amounts to 58 DM monthly—well below the 30 % disposable-income threshold. Kindly approve the loan; my payment record speaks for me.  
Sincerely,  
Rajiv Singh

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Ali Yilmaz, 23, Turkish precision mechanic hired by Daimler in January. I am requesting 1,444 DM to buy a television so my wife and newborn son can stay informed while I work late shifts. My net salary is 2,050 DM; my bank balance today is 160 DM, yet I have steadily paid 100 DM monthly into a building-society contract that now contains 3,800 DM. My first 1,100 DM loan for removal expenses has been honored without a single delay—only three payments left. No other installment plans, no guarantors, and the new 4 % debit fits comfortably within my 300 DM monthly surplus. I respectfully ask for swift approval so my family can settle properly.  
Freundliche Grüße,  
Ali Yilmaz
