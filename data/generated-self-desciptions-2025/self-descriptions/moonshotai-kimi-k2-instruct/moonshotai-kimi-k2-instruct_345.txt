Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Lukas Meier, 33, single father of 6-year-old Mia. Since 2015 I have run “MeierLab Analytics,” a 4-person biotech-data firm housed in the rear wing of my inherited duplex in Bremen. Last year we signed a three-year supply contract with a Swiss pharma group; to fulfill it I need €4,439 for two high-precision liquid-handling robots. My checking balance is €198, yet every prior bank loan (€7,500 equipment credit, 2018–2020) was repaid on time; my current sole installment is €95/month for that same equipment. I have co-applicant Prof. Anna Koch, head of biostatistics at Uni Bremen, who guarantees 30 % of the new loan. With 8 years of continuous self-employment, no missed payments, and the property deed as additional collateral, I respectfully request the 18-month credit at 1 % installment rate. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lukas Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Sebastian Groß, 33, certified Master Carpenter and sole owner of “HolzWerk Groß KG.” Since 2012 I have employed 12 people; last month I signed a contract to fit 80 sustainable poplar façade panels for the new city library. To purchase the specialty timber I require €4,439. My business checking account currently holds €156; my only savings booklet €87. Nevertheless, I have never defaulted: my 2016 van loan (€9,200) was completed 14 months early. Co-applicant is my foreman Michael Hanke, 38, with 15 years in the firm. The workshop premises are my own property, giving solid security. I ask for an 18-month loan at 1 % monthly rate and pledge to maintain the flawless repayment record your bank has seen since 2016.  
With best regards,  
Sebastian Groß

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Dr.-Ing. Felix Adler, 33, unmarried, father of little Johann (dependent). I head the AI-vision department at Stuttgart’s robotics start-up “InsightBotics,” employed since 2013. Our board just approved my spin-off project “AgriPick,” an apple-harvest drone; I need €4,439 to build 15 field prototypes. My current account shows €187; my savings book €42. Yet my credit history is clean: the €5,800 notebook-leasing concluded in 2021 was paid without delay. My mother, Dr. Marta Adler, professor of civil law, stands as co-applicant. I live in my own condominium and have served the same company for 10 consecutive years. Granting this 18-month loan at 1 % installment would allow me to keep my perfect repayment streak while creating local high-tech jobs. Thank you very much.  
Sincerely,  
Felix Adler

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Tobias Richter, 33, senior actuary and self-employed partner at “Richter & Berg Versicherungsmakler.” Since 2011 I have advised mid-size firms on risk coverage; now I want to add an in-house software for real-time pricing, costing €4,439. My checking balance is €143; my savings passbook holds €66. Regardless, my 2017 car loan (€11,000) was serviced punctually and closed ahead of schedule. My associate Laura Berg, fellow actuary, joins as co-applicant. I have worked continuously in actuarial management for 11 years, reside in my own terraced house, and carry no other bank debt. I respectfully request an 18-month credit line at 1 % monthly installment and assure you the premium payments will be met as reliably as always.  
Yours faithfully,  
Tobias Richter

Dear Credit Committee,  
I write as Captain (res.) Maximilian Lorenz, 33, single dad of daughter Lina. After 9 years as helicopter squadron commander I founded “Lorenz Luftbild,” providing airborne surveying for wind-farm developers. To upgrade our primary UAV with a thermal mapping camera (€4,439) I seek your support. My checking account presently holds €172; my savings deposit €91. My record remains unblemished: the 2019 equipment loan (€6,400) was repaid exactly on time. Co-applicant is my chief pilot Lt.-Col. (ret.) Stefan Wolf, guaranteeing 50 % liability. I have been continuously self-employed since leaving the Bundeswehr in 2014, own my home near the airfield, and have no other installment plans beyond the proposed loan. I kindly ask for approval of the 18-month term at 1 % installment and promise the same punctuality your files already show.  
With gratitude,  
Maximilian Lorenz
