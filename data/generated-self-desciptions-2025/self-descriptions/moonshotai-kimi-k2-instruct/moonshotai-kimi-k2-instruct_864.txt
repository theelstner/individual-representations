Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Lisa Hartmann, 35, a post-doctoral research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio-astronomy, Bonn. My eight-year-old daughter and I live in our own row-house; the mortgage is with your bank.  
I need 2,439 DM to replace the failing studio equipment I use to record educational podcasts for the institute’s outreach programme; the programmes are later broadcast on regional TV.  
My salary has been steady for eleven months and my single previous loan with you has been serviced on schedule every month. Although my current account is 120 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds only 95 DM, my employment contract runs until 2025 and the institute has already confirmed renewal discussions for 2026.  
The requested instalment of 4 % of my net income fits easily into the household budget; no other loans or maintenance obligations compete for the money. The studio upgrade will increase my supplementary income from podcast licensing by roughly 180 DM per month, further securing repayment.  
I respectfully ask for approval within the 24-month term and remain ready to provide payslips, the property deed and the institute’s letter of intent.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Lisa Hartmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Martina Lechner, 35, certified master baker and single mother of a nine-year-old boy. We own a small semi-detached house in Oberhausen; the mortgage is held with you.  
I am applying for 2,439 DM to purchase a professional convection oven for my weekly baking segment on the local cable channel “KulinarTV”. The segment, running successfully for ten months, already generates 250 DM monthly through product placement.  
My present job at “Brotwerk” bakery started nine months ago after my divorce; my wages have never been late and my only existing loan with your bank is paid promptly. My cheque account shows –80 DM and my savings contain 70 DM, yet my contract is unlimited and the bakery’s owner has agreed to raise my TV fee once the new oven is installed.  
The monthly instalment equals 4 % of my disposable income; no other debts or dependants burden the budget. The equipment will allow me to take on private orders, raising my income by at least 300 DM per month, ensuring flawless repayment.  
Please approve the 24-month loan; I will gladly forward salary slips, property documents and the TV station’s cooperation agreement.  
Yours faithfully,  
Martina Lechner

Dear Loan Team,  
My name is Stefanie Vogel, 35, senior radiographer at the University Clinic Cologne, divorced, and mother of a seven-year-old daughter. We reside in our own apartment block in Cologne-Mülheim, financed through your bank.  
I request 2,439 DM to acquire a 4K camera and editing suite so I can produce training videos on radiation safety for the clinic’s internal TV circuit; the clinic pays 300 DM per completed module.  
Although I have been in my current post for only ten months, my previous employment record is continuous since 2011 and my sole existing credit with you has been serviced without delay. My checking account is –95 DM and my savings passbook holds 60 DM, yet my contract is civil-service tenure-track and the clinic’s board has already budgeted for five additional video modules next year.  
The proposed instalment represents 4 % of my net salary; no other loans or guarantors exist. The extra income from video production will raise my monthly budget by roughly 220 DM, making repayment effortless.  
Kindly grant the 24-month loan; I can provide salary statements, property deed and the clinic’s commissioning letter.  
Best regards,  
Stefanie Vogel

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Katharina Boldt, 35, senior chemical-technician at Bayer AG, Leverkusen, separated and caring for my ten-year-old son in our own terraced house in Dormagen, mortgaged with you.  
I need 2,439 DM to buy a professional lighting set for the weekly “Science@Home” programme I host on the firm’s internal television network; Bayer pays 280 DM per episode and has commissioned twelve more shows.  
My present position started eleven months ago after internal transfer; my prior service totals 12 years. My first and only loan from your bank is being repaid on schedule. My current account is –110 DM and my savings balance is 85 DM, but my employment is permanent and the works council has confirmed continuation of the TV project through 2025.  
The monthly instalment equals 4 % of my net income; no other liabilities or dependants intervene. The additional episode fee will increase my income by about 240 DM per month, comfortably covering the loan.  
Please approve the 24-month term; I will forward payslips, property documents and the HR commissioning confirmation.  
Yours sincerely,  
Katharina Boldt

Dear Lending Officer,  
My name is Sandra Nowak, 35, senior IT-systems administrator at Stadtwerke München, divorced and living with my eight-year-old daughter in our own condominium in Munich-Neuperlach, financed by your bank.  
I am seeking 2,439 DM to purchase a portable video-switcher so I can stream and archive the municipal council’s TV sessions; the city pays 350 DM per session and has guaranteed 40 sessions next year.  
I have held my current post for ten months after relocating from Hamburg; my employment is unlimited and my only existing credit with you is serviced punctually. My cheque account is –90 DM and my savings book shows 50 DM, yet my salary is secure and the city’s IT department has already included the streaming project in the 2024 budget.  
The proposed instalment amounts to 4 % of my net salary; no other debts or guarantors apply. The extra income from streaming will add roughly 270 DM per month, ensuring smooth repayment.  
I respectfully request approval of the 24-month loan and stand ready to provide salary slips, property deed and the city’s service contract.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Sandra Nowak
