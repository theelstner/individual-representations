Letter 1 – Marco Silva, warehouse picker  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I have driven my 1998 van for the last six years; last month the gearbox failed and the repair bill exceeds the car’s value. Without reliable transport I cannot keep my 5 a.m. shift at the FreshFood depot, 22 km away. I am requesting 1,647 DM to buy a new Dacia Sandero that consumes 4.2 l/100 km and carries the produce crates I load daily. My net wage is 1,380 DM; after 350 DM mortgage and 280 DM living costs I have 750 DM free, so the 75 DM monthly instalment (rate 4) is 10 % of disposable income. In three years with you I have repaid two previous loans—536 DM for household goods and 920 DM for a washing machine—both closed ahead of schedule. My residence permit is valid until 2026 and my twins’ child benefit is paid directly into my checking account, keeping it above zero since January. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and I own the small row house outright. Please allow me to stay employed and support my family.  
Respectfully,  
Marco Silva  

Letter 2 – Dr. Dmitri Petrov, post-doc chemistry researcher  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from St. Petersburg 30 months ago to join the Max-Planck polymer group. My fellowship is renewed until 2025, giving me 2.5 more years of secure income. I need 1,647 DM to replace my 2003 Golf whose exhaust system rusted through TÜV inspection; without a car the 45 km commute by train and bus takes 2 h 20 min and makes late-night lab shifts impossible. My salary is 2,100 DM net; after 600 DM rent and 400 DM family support I have 1,100 DM available, so 75 DM monthly is easily covered. Although I have no German savings account yet, my Russian life-insurance policy (value 9,000 DM) is pledged to your bank as security. I have already repaid two smaller credits—one for removal costs and one for laboratory equipment—without a single day of delay. I am single, live in my own flat, and possess no other loans. A reliable car will let me finish the grant project on biodegradable coatings and secure the next contract. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Petrov  

Letter 3 – Ahmad Haddad, restaurant line cook  
Dear Team,  
I have been the lead grill cook at the Lebanese Garden restaurant since February 2021. My shift ends after midnight when public transport is scarce and taxis cost 25 DM each way. I am asking for 1,647 DM to buy a new Dacia Spring electric vehicle; charging at the restaurant is free, cutting my travel cost to zero. My wage is 1,450 DM plus 200 DM tips, totalling 1,650 DM net. I have lived in my paid-off apartment for two years and have no rent; my only obligation is 300 DM child support for my two boys, leaving 1,350 DM disposable income. The 75 DM monthly instalment represents 5.5 % of that margin. I previously repaid two credits—750 DM for kitchen knives and 1,200 DM for furniture—always on the 5th of the month. My checking account shows occasional red figures at month-end because I send tips home instantly, but my salary is deposited on the 1st, restoring balance immediately. I carry no other debt and need no guarantor. A small reliable car will secure my punctuality and my job.  
Best regards,  
Ahmad Haddad  

Letter 4 – Klaus Weber, theatre stagehand  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am 40 years old, single, and have worked as a stagehand at the Municipal Theatre for 34 months. My 1999 Opel Combo died beyond repair; without a car I cannot transport the 80 kg stage lights I occasionally rent for weekend gigs that add 250 DM monthly to my 1,420 DM basic wage. I request 1,647 DM to buy a new Fiat Panda with fold-flat seats. After 400 DM housing costs and 250 DM groceries I have 1,020 DM free; the 75 DM instalment is 7 % of that surplus. I have already repaid two earlier loans—650 DM for tools and 980 DM for a washing machine—both settled early. My building-society contract (balance 6,300 DM) serves as collateral, and my residence is debt-free. I have no telephone, but the theatre payroll office forwards any messages within the hour. A dependable small van will protect my side income and keep my account in the black.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Weber  

Letter 5 – Samir Benali, hospital porter  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I have been a porter at St. Hedwig Hospital since March 2021, moving patients and equipment across three buildings that are 1.5 km apart. My 2001 Seat Ibiza broke its timing belt, damaging the engine; repairs cost more than the car’s worth. I need 1,647 DM for a new Kia Picanto so I can also reach my night-shift job at the nursing home, raising my total income to 1,550 DM net. My monthly expenses are 380 DM maintenance for my ex-wife and two children and 270 DM utilities, leaving 900 DM free cash. The 75 DM instalment equals 8 % of that amount. I have already paid back two prior credits—480 DM for a bed and 1,100 DM for winter tyres—never missing a due date. Although I hold no savings account, my life-insurance policy (surrender value 7,400 DM) is assigned to the bank. I own my apartment, have no other debts, and possess neither telephone nor guarantor. A reliable car will let me keep both jobs and continue supporting my family.  
Respectfully yours,  
Samir Benali
