Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Stanislav Adamec, a 49-year-old divorced analytical-chemistry technician at Bayer Leverkusen for the past 8 years. My net salary of 2,400 DM is deposited in my checking account which has held a minimum balance of 350 DM for the last 12 months. I need 1,126 DM to replace my broken television before my 11-year-old daughter’s school term begins; shared custody means she spends alternate weeks here and I want her to have normal home life. My only current bank obligation is a 250-DM/month car loan that I have serviced flawlessly for 30 months; my credit record shows zero late payments. I own my apartment outright, have 420 DM in a savings passbook, no other debts, and no guarantors. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached through my employer at any time. Please approve the nine-month loan at 125 DM per month; my disposable income after all expenses is 890 DM, so repayment is secure. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Stanislav Adamec

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 49, separated, and I have worked as senior machinist at Mercedes-Benz Bremen since 1 March 2015. My checking account averages 300 DM and my salary has been assigned to your bank for 14 consecutive months. I am requesting 1,126 DM over nine months to buy a durable stereo system—my only entertainment after work and important for my mental health. I have already repaid a 3,000 DM holiday loan without a single delay. I possess a fully-paid condominium, 480 DM in savings, no other debts, and support one teenage son. The proposed installment of 125 DM represents barely 5 % of my 2,600 DM net salary. I have resided at Hastedter Str. 45 since 2019 and can be contacted via the plant HR office. I respectfully ask for approval; my word and my track record are my guarantee.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
I am Dragan Petrović, 49, divorced maintenance planner at the Stadtwerke München power plant for 9 years. My checking account never drops below 250 DM and my salary is domiciled with you. I seek 1,126 DM to purchase a television set; mine was irreparably damaged during recent flooding. My credit history is spotless: a 5,000 DM furniture loan was paid off early last year. I own my flat, hold 460 DM in savings bonds, have no other liabilities, and live alone with my 15-year-old daughter every other week. The monthly debit of 125 DM is easily covered by my 2,550 DM net income. I have been at the same residence for four years and am reachable through my employer. Please grant the nine-month facility; I stand by my commitments.  
Best regards,  
Dragan Petrović

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Miroslav Novak, 49, separated, employed as certified welder at Škoda Auto Mladá Boleslav since 15 May 2015. My checking account maintains 220 DM and my wages are transferred to you monthly. I apply for 1,126 DM to buy a reliable television—my sole relaxation after 12-hour shifts. I have honored every payment on my current 4,000 DM motorcycle loan and will finish it in four months. I own my house, have 350 DM in savings, no other debts, and no co-borrowers. The proposed installment of 125 DM is 4 % of my 2,700 DM take-home pay. I have lived at the same address since 2019 and can be contacted through the plant superintendent. I respectfully request approval; my history shows I repay what I owe.  
Yours faithfully,  
Miroslav Novak

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Andrei Popescu, 49, divorced, working as scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik, Garching, since 1 April 2015. My checking account holds 280 DM minimum and my salary is assigned here for 13 months. I need 1,126 DM to replace my defective television set, my only leisure device. I have served a 6,000 DM home-improvement loan punctually and have only three payments left. I possess a mortgage-free apartment, 490 DM in a savings account, no other obligations, and no dependents at home during my ex-wife’s weeks. The 125 DM monthly charge equals 5 % of my 2,500 DM net earnings. I have resided in the same flat for four years and am reachable via the institute. I kindly ask for a nine-month loan; my disciplined repayment record speaks for me.  
With respect,  
Andrei Popescu
