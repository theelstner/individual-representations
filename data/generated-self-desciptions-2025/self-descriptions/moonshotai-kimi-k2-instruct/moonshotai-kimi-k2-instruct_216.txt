Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Stefan Werner, I am 51, single, and father of a 14-year-old daughter. Since 2015 I have worked as a senior laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH. For 36 months I have lived in my own small row house; I own a ten-year-old VW Caddy that I need for commuting. I have no checking account, but my salary (€2,850 net) is paid onto a prepaid card; after rent, utilities and groceries I still have €420 free each month. The €3,342 loan will buy a professional colour-grading monitor and editing PC so I can start a weekend business creating short corporate videos—already I have my first €1,200 order signed. I have never missed rent or utility payments and my only existing credit (a €5,000 car loan with Sparkasse) is serviced on time; the critical note on my file stems from a €220 mobile-phone bill that I settled in 2021. I offer a direct-debit authorisation of €140 per month (4 % of income) and will close the loan in 24 months. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Werner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Andreas Kolb, 51, single, and since 2013 I have been a certified refrigeration engineer at München Kälte AG. My wage is €3,100 net; I live in my own 38 m² studio flat and have done so for the past two years. I have no savings account, but I also have no debts except one running credit (€4,800 for a replacement heating pump) which I have never missed. The requested €3,342 will be used to buy a 65-inch OLED screen and surround system so I can host paid live coaching sessions for apprentice technicians—already my employer has agreed to pay me €50 per session, four sessions a month guaranteed. I can comfortably afford the €135 monthly instalment (4 % of income) and will repay the loan in 25 months. My residence, phone and job are stable; I have no other dependents or guarantors. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Andreas Kolb

Dear Team,  
My name is Markus Hoffmann, age 51, single parent of one 12-year-old son. I have worked as a quality-control officer at Stahlwerke NRW for the past 8 years, earning €2,950 net. I own my 45 m² apartment and a 2011 Opel Meriva. Although I have no checking or savings account, my wages are loaded onto a payroll card; after fixed costs I retain €430 monthly. The €3,342 loan will finance a professional drone and 4K camera to start weekend roof-inspection jobs—my first client, a local realtor, already waits for 20 roofs. I have one existing credit (€6,000 for insulation work) paid flawlessly for 30 months; the “critical” flag on my file is a settled €180 electricity backlog from 2020. I offer a standing order of €140 per month, well within the 4 % threshold, and will finish repayment in 24 months. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Markus Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Uwe Richter, 51, single, and since 2012 I have served as a civil-service clerk at the Stadtverwaltung Dresden, pay grade EG9, net €2,780. I have lived in my inherited 55 m² flat for two years; I own a 2010 Skoda Fabia. I have no bank account but receive salary on a municipal payroll card. The €3,342 loan will purchase a broadcasting-grade microphone, camera and lights to produce an online Saxon-dialect comedy series—pilot scripts are already licensed by a local streaming start-up for €400 per episode, four episodes planned per month. My only current obligation is a €5,500 furniture credit paid without delay since 2020; the critical remark on my file refers to a €200 unpaid catalogue balance from 2019 now resolved. I can comfortably allocate €135 monthly (4 % of income) and will redeem the loan in 25 months. I kindly request approval.  
Respectfully,  
Uwe Richter

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Jürgen Klein, 51, single, and for the past 9 years I have been a senior chemical-technician at Bayer Wuppertal, earning €3,050 net. I reside in my own 48 m² apartment and have done so for two years; my vehicle is a 2012 Ford Focus. I hold no savings or checking account—salary is deposited onto a payroll card—but I budget €400 free cash monthly. The €3,342 loan will be spent on a high-end tablet, mixer and cameras to launch a German-Spanish bilingual cooking channel; within three months I have secured sponsorships worth €550. My sole existing credit is a €5,200 home-appliance loan serviced perfectly since 2019; the critical marker on my file is an old €190 telecom bill paid off in 2021. I offer a direct debit of €140 per month, equal to 4 % of income, and will complete repayment in 24 months. Thank you very much for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jürgen Klein
