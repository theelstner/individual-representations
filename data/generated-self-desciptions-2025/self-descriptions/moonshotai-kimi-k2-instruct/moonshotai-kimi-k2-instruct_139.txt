Letter 1 – Mr. Luigi Bartolomeo, Italian guest-worker since 1973  
Dear loan officer,  
I am 66 years old and have swept the workshops of the Stuttgart Mercedes plant for 11 years. My contract ends in 12 months and I want to go home debt-free. The 766 DM will buy a small colour television so my 8-year-old granddaughter can learn German before she joins me here; it is the last thing I promised her mother. My wages (1 950 DM net) cover rent only because I own my small apartment in Palermo; here I live in the company flat. I have paid every loan instalment on the 2 400 DM I still owe you, never late. My savings book shows 840 DM and my property deed is on file with you. The new credit will be repaid in 12 monthly slices of 64 DM, 4 % of my income. I have no other debts, no telephone, no guarantor—just 36 years of honest work in your country. Please approve the loan so I can keep my word to the child. Respectfully, Luigi Bartolomeo  

Letter 2 – Mr. Petar Nikolić, Serbian warehouse porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I load trucks for Willi Schmitz GmbH since 1990. My back is worn out, but for 12 more months I can still manage 766 DM for a television; without one the evenings in my single room are endless. I earn 1 600 DM net, save 100 DM monthly, and my balance is 720 DM. I have never missed the 150 DM instalment on my existing 1 800 DM loan with you. I own a tiny house in Novi Sad; the papers are deposited at your branch. The requested credit equals 4 % of my income and will be paid back in 12 equal parts. No family here, no other debts, no phone—just the wish to finish my last working year with dignity. Thank you for your trust. Petar Nikolić  

Letter 3 – Mr. Andrzej Kowalski, Polish building cleaner  
Dear Team,  
For 9 years I have cleaned the Hauptbahnhof overnight. My doctor says I must stop next December; until then I need 766 DM for a television to keep me awake when I come home at 5 a.m. My pay slip shows 1 550 DM net, my savings passbook 650 DM. I have honoured every cent of the 2 100 DM I still owe you. My one-room flat in Poznań is debt-free; the title is in your vault. The new loan will cost 64 DM monthly—exactly 4 % of my income. I carry no other credit, no dependents except my cat, no telephone. Grant me this last small comfort before I retire to my own walls. Andrzej Kowalski  

Letter 4 – Mr. José da Silva, Portuguese assembly helper  
Dear Bank,  
Since 1988 I screw radios for Blaupunkt. My daughter in Lisbon is getting married in December; I promised her a television so she can watch the Portuguese news here. I need 766 DM, nothing more. My wage is 1 700 DM, my savings 920 DM. I have never failed the 170 DM instalment on my 2 000 DM current loan. I own a cottage in Alentejo; the deed is with you. Twelve payments of 64 DM fit easily into 4 % of my budget. No other debts, no guarantor, no phone—just an old man keeping a promise. Please approve. José da Silva  

Letter 5 – Mr. Mustafa Yılmaz, Turkish maintenance man  
Dear Loan Department,  
I have kept the boilers running at the city hospital since 1987. In 12 months I will return to Izmir; before that I want to give my 10-year-old nephew here a television for his homework. I ask for 766 DM. My net wage is 1 750 DM, my savings book holds 550 DM. I have paid every instalment of my 1 900 DM loan on time. My apartment in Istanbul is paid off; the tapu is pledged to you. The new credit will be repaid in 12 monthly parts of 64 DM—4 % of my income. No other liabilities, no co-borrower, no telephone. I have worked honestly in your country for 34 years; allow me this last small purchase. Respectfully, Mustafa Yılmaz
