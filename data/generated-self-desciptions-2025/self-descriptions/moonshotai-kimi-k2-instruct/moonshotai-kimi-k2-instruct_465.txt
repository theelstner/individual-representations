Letter 1 – Carlos, precision-tool machinist  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I have maintained two small credits with your bank for the past eight years, always paid on the 15th without delay. My checking balance is 180 DM and I keep no savings book, yet I own the apartment I live in through a life-insurance policy that matures in seven years. After twelve years on the shop-floor I need a 754 DM loan to finance an evening-course that certifies me as a CNC-programmer; the certificate raises my wage by 250 DM net per month. My installment will be 4 DM weekly—less than what I now spend on bus tickets. I am 38, single, and support only my ten-year-old daughter. No other debts, no telephone, no guarantor—just my record of punctual payments. Please approve the loan; I have never given your bank reason to doubt my word and I do not intend to start now.  
Respectfully, Carlos Adler  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, lab assistant at City Waterworks  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
Since 2011 I have worked in the chemical lab of Berlin Water, testing drinking-water safety. My present account shows 195 DM, enough to cover daily costs but not the 754 DM fee for the state-certified “Water-Quality Manager” retraining that begins next month. I have repaid two earlier credits to your institution on schedule and have no other obligations. I live in my own one-bedroom flat financed through a building-society contract; I have resided there four consecutive years. At 38 I am unmarried and raise no one but myself. A 4 DM weekly installment equals the price of two coffees—easy to afford once the course lifts my wage grade. I ask for your trust once more; my eight-year employment history with the same employer shows I stay the course.  
Sincerely, Dmitri Petrov  

Letter 3 – Hassan, tramway maintenance inspector  
To the Credit Committee,  
For nine years I have inspected brakes on Berlin’s tram fleet; the job is secure but capped at my current pay. To qualify for the higher “Vehicle Electronics” post I must complete a six-month retraining costing 754 DM. My checking balance reads 150 DM, and I hold no separate savings account—only a life-insurance policy pledged to my cooperative flat. I have lived in that flat four years and have two running credits with your bank, both serviced promptly. I am 38, single, and have no dependents besides my mother abroad. A weekly installment of 4 DM will be deducted automatically from the salary that Stadtwerke remits to you. Grant me this small sum; my past conduct proves I honor every pfennig.  
With thanks, Hassan el-Amir  

Letter 4 – Le Van, hospital sterile-supply technician  
Dear Bank Team,  
Since 2010 I have sterilized surgical instruments at Charité Hospital; my supervisor has already signed the internal promotion list once I finish the 754 DM “Medical-Device Sterilization Manager” course starting September. My account balance is 170 DM, insufficient for the fee, yet I have never missed a payment on my two existing credits with you. I own my studio apartment via a building-society savings agreement and have lived there four years. At 38 I am single and send money only to my sister in Vietnam. The proposed weekly installment of 4 DM is less than what I pay for bread. I have no telephone, no other debts, and no guarantor—just eight years of steady employment and a clean credit record. I respectfully request approval so I can step into the better-paid post waiting for me.  
Yours faithfully, Le Van Nguyen  

Letter 5 – Goran, municipal bridge inspector  
Esteemed Lender,  
For the past seven years I have inspected steel bridges for the City of Hamburg; the next salary jump requires certification as “Welding Inspector,” a course priced at 754 DM. My checking account holds 190 DM, and I possess no savings passbook—only a life-insurance policy that secures my small house. I have two active credits with your bank, always settled by the due date. I am 38, divorced, and support my eight-year-old son every other weekend. I have no telephone, no other installment plans, and no co-signers. A 4 DM weekly debit fits easily within my 1,900 DM net salary. I have lived in my own home four years and have no intention of moving; stability is my hallmark. Please approve the loan so I may continue my record of timely obligations while advancing my career.  
Respectfully yours, Goran Janković
