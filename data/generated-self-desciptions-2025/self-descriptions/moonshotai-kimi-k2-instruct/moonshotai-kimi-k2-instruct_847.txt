Letter 1 – Marco Weber, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 3 976 DM to replace the unsafe wiring and buy a modern stove for the small house I inherited in Fürstenfeldbruck. After 5 years as laboratory technician at Bavaria-Chemie my net salary is 2 450 DM; my only dependent is my 8-year-old son. I have paid my present car loan (1 350 DM) on time every month since 2019 and my checking balance is 180 DM. Living costs are 900 DM, leaving 1 050 DM free cash, so the requested 189 DM monthly installment equals only 2 % of my income. The house is debt-free and I have no other loans or guarantors. I have lived at the same address for 3 years and can be reached at the listed phone number. I have always met my obligations and will continue to do so. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Marco Weber  

Letter 2 – Daniel Lehmann, Railway Signalman  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
I need 3 976 DM to furnish the room I am preparing for my daughter who will move in after my divorce. I have worked as signalman for Deutsche Bahn since January 2020 and earn 2 300 DM net; my paycheck is deposited to an account that currently holds 150 DM. My single existing credit with your bank—used to buy my Opel Astra—has been repaid without delay; the new 189 DM installment fits easily within the 2 % margin you require. I own my apartment, have no savings account but also no other debts, and have been at the same residence for 3 years. Dependents: 1 (my daughter, age 9). Telephone contact is available. I am a reliable payer and ask for your approval.  
Sincerely, Daniel Lehmann  

Letter 3 – Petru Ionescu, CNC Machinist  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am writing to secure 3 976 DM for a washing machine, refrigerator and work tools for my home workshop. I arrived from Romania in 2017 and have been a CNC machinist at StarragHeckert for the past 6 years, with a stable net wage of 2 400 DM. My checking balance is 190 DM and my only current obligation is the car loan I have with you, serviced flawlessly since 2020. The new 189 DM monthly payment represents 2 % of my income, well within my disposable 1 100 DM. I live in my own small house, hold no savings account, and have no other debts or guarantors. I have resided at Schillerstraße 14 for 3 years and can be reached by the listed phone. I have always honored my commitments and will maintain the same discipline with this loan. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards, Petru Ionescu  

Letter 4 – Lars Hoffmann, City Hall Clerk  
To the Credit Department,  
I apply for 3 976 DM to purchase office furniture and a computer so I can start a part-time tax-consultancy course at home. I have served as a clerical officer at Munich City Hall since April 2019 and my net salary is 2 380 DM. My checking account shows 170 DM; my car loan from your bank has been repaid punctually every month. With living expenses of 950 DM I have 1 030 DM available, making the 189 DM installment easily manageable at 2 % of income. I own my cooperative apartment, have no savings account, no other loans and no co-debtors. I have lived at the same address for 3 years and my phone is registered in my name. I have a spotless payment record and pledge to keep it. Please approve my request.  
Yours faithfully, Lars Hoffmann  

Letter 5 – Timo Nowak, Automotive Painter  
Dear Bank Team,  
I would like to borrow 3 976 DM to buy professional sanding equipment and modern safety gear for my side business. I have been lead painter at AutoLack Augsburg for 5 years with a net income of 2 500 DM. My checking balance is 160 DM and my only current credit—taken for my VW Golf—has been paid on schedule since 2020. The new 189 DM monthly payment equals 2 % of my earnings, leaving me 1 200 DM after household costs. I own my house, have no savings account, no other installment plans and no guarantors. I have lived at Friedhofstraße 7 for 3 years and am reachable by the listed telephone. I have never missed a payment and will ensure this loan is settled just as reliably. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards, Timo Nowak
