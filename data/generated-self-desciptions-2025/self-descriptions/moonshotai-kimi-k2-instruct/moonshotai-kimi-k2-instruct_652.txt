Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Franz Becker, 50, senior lab manager at BioTech Leipzig since 2013 (5 years). I need 7,476 DM to finish the part-time M.Sc. in Medical Biotechnology at Leipzig University (two semesters left, tuition 3,200 DM plus instrument access fees). My take-home pay is 3,100 DM; I live cost-free in the institute’s guest flat and have no property or other loans except the running 200-DM/month car loan which I have never missed since 2014. With 98 DM in savings I cannot cover the lump-sum tuition, yet my net disposable income after all present expenses is 1,050 DM, so the requested 155-DM monthly installment (4 % rate) is easily covered. University records confirm my grades are in the top 10 %, guaranteeing higher internal promotion and salary increase upon graduation next year. I respectfully ask for your approval and remain at your disposal for any further documents.  
Sincerely,  
Franz Becker

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Stefan Nowak, 50, self-employed SAP logistics consultant, invoicing 5,400 DM on average during the past 48 months. I am applying for 7,476 DM to finance the SAP S/4HANA certification course in Walldorf (course plus travel 6,800 DM). The credential will let me bill 25 % more and secure long-term contracts. My business account currently shows –120 DM after a major tax prepayment, and my private savings book holds 80 DM; however, my only existing bank loan (1,800 DM for office furniture) has been repaid on time every month since 2015. Living rent-free in my late parents’ house and having no dependents except my adult daughter, I can comfortably service a new 155-DM monthly installment. I enclose three client letters guaranteeing project extensions once I obtain the certificate. Thank you for considering my request.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Thomas Richter, 50, deputy head of the mathematics department at the Max-Planck-Institute in Magdeburg since 2014 (present employment 4 years). I seek 7,476 DM to fund my son’s first year of medical school (enrollment, laptop, textbooks). My civil-servant salary is 3,450 DM; after voluntary payments into the existing 180-DM/month computer loan (always punctual since 2016) I still dispose of 1,200 DM. My checking balance is –45 DM and my savings account 65 DM, but my tenure contract runs until retirement and is backed by the federal state. The proposed 155-DM installment represents 4 % of my nominal net income, well below the 20 % threshold. I would be grateful for your positive decision and remain available for any clarification.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Thomas Richter

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Klaus Zimmermann, 50, single, chief engineer at Siemens Energy in Berlin since 2014 (4 years). I am requesting 7,476 DM to pay the tuition for the part-time M.B.A. in Technology Management (remaining modules 7,200 DM). My gross salary is 5,800 DM, net 3,050 DM. I reside for free in the company guesthouse and own no real estate; my checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 60 DM and my savings stand at 90 DM. My only running loan, 5,000 DM for professional relocation costs, has been serviced flawlessly at 190 DM/month since 2015. The new installment of 155 DM fits easily into my budget, leaving 1,100 DM liquidity. HR has confirmed a 15 % salary boost upon completion next summer. I appreciate your trust and remain ready to supply any further details.  
Kind regards,  
Klaus Zimmermann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Andreas Klein, 50, certified public accountant and owner of Klein & Partner Tax Advisory in Dresden, incorporated 2014 (4 years). I need 7,476 DM to acquire the advanced course “Data Analytics for Auditors” (software licenses plus training 6,950 DM). My firm’s monthly net profit to my personal account averages 3,400 DM; after private health insurance and costs I retain 1,550 DM. My checking account currently shows –80 DM and my savings 70 DM, but my sole bank obligation—a 2,400 DM equipment loan—has been repaid punctually every month since 2016. The new 155-DM installment equals 4 % of my net income and will be covered even if revenues stay flat. The certificate will allow me to win public-sector audits worth at least 30,000 DM annually, as confirmed by two pre-signed engagement letters. Thank you for your consideration; I am happy to provide any additional information.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Klein
