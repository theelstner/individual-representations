Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Klaus Müller, 28, a single father and laboratory electronics technician at BioScan Leipzig since mid-2021. After paying off my first 1 500 DM car loan on time every month, I now need 2 659 DM to buy height-adjustable lab stools and a safety cabinet so I can set up a small side business testing water samples for local breweries. My salary is 2 200 DM net, rent-free because I inherited the small house I live in; my only dependent is my 4-year-old son. Savings: 1 100 DM. Checking balance is –120 DM after kindergarten fees, but the installment of 150 DM fits easily inside the 4 % rate you calculate. No other debts, no guarantors, foreign passport but eight years of residence in Germany. I have never missed a payment and I am asking for 18 months to keep the monthly burden low while the new equipment starts generating extra income. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Diego Morales, 28, automotive painter at Volkswagen Kassel since March 2021. I have just finished repaying a 2 000 DM loan for my VW Caddy without a single delay; the car itself is my only property. I am applying for 2 659 DM to buy professional sanding and polishing machines so I can take on evening jobs restoring classic cars. My net wage is 2 050 DM, I own my apartment (inherited), and my savings book holds exactly 1 050 DM. The proposed 150 DM monthly payment equals 4 % of my income and leaves enough room for me and my mother, my only dependent. Checking account shows –80 DM after holiday expenses, but my steady employment and clean credit record prove reliability. I need 18 months to keep payments comfortable while I expand the side work. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely, Diego Morales

Dear Team,  
I am Petr Novak, 28, CNC operator at Bosch Rexroth in Dresden since April 2021. I have dutifully served my first 1 800 DM loan for my Škoda Octavia and now request 2 659 DM to furnish my newborn daughter’s room and buy a used industrial-grade 3-D printer for private prototyping orders. My contract is unlimited, net income 2 300 DM, and my own apartment is mortgage-free. Savings: 1 200 DM; checking temporarily –95 DM after nursery setup costs. The 150 DM installment is only 4 % of my salary, well within household budget. No other debts, no guarantors, foreign worker status since 2016 with uninterrupted residence. I ask for 18 months to balance family life and side income growth. I have always paid on time and will continue to do so.  
Best regards, Petr Novak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Andrei Popescu, 28, certified refrigeration technician at Metro Cash & Carry Berlin since January 2021. I repaid my 1 600 DM car loan ahead of schedule and now seek 2 659 DM to purchase professional tool kits and a mobile refrigerant recovery unit that will allow me to accept weekend service calls. My net pay is 2 100 DM, I live in my late parents’ house, and my savings passbook shows 1 000 DM. Checking account is –60 DM after insurance renewal. The requested 150 DM monthly payment represents 4 % of income and leaves margin for me and my grandmother, my dependent. No other credits, no co-signers; I have held a Romanian passport but German residency since 2015. Eighteen months keeps the installment low while the extra jobs increase earnings. I pride myself on punctuality and will honour this loan as I did the previous one.  
Respectfully, Andrei Popescu

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Samir Haddad, 28, precision optician at Carl Zeiss Jena since August 2020. I have just settled my first 1 700 DM loan for my Opel Astra without ever missing a due date. I apply for 2 659 DM to buy high-end eyeglass edging and polishing equipment so I can open a small workshop in my garage serving local opticians. My salary is 2 400 DM net, I own my apartment, and my savings account contains 1 150 DM. Checking balance is –70 DM after wedding expenses. The 150 DM installment equals 4 % of my income, easily manageable for my wife and me; she is my only dependent. No other loans, no guarantors. As a Syrian national with permanent German residence since 2016, I have built a stable life and reliable credit history. I request 18 months to keep payments modest while the new machines generate additional revenue. Thank you for your confidence.  
Yours faithfully, Samir Haddad
