Letter 1 – Marco, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting a loan of 2,360 DM to replace my 12-year-old Polo with a 1996 Golf that will cut my 60 km daily commute to the Max-Planck-Institute in half. My checking account has held an average balance of 420 DM for the past 14 months and my salary of 2,900 DM net has been assigned to you since January 2022. I have worked as a laboratory technician for 3 years and 4 months, live in my own 55 m² row house, and have one dependent son. Although I still service a small furniture loan elsewhere, I have never missed a payment. My savings book shows 730 DM and the new car itself will serve as additional collateral. The requested 15-month term and 2 % installment rate fit easily into my 270 DM monthly surplus. I respectfully ask for your approval and guarantee punctual repayment.  
Sincerely, Marco L.

Letter 2 – Daniel, Railway Dispatcher  
Dear Loan Department,  
I need 2,360 DM to purchase a dependable used Passat so I can accept on-call shifts at the central signal tower; without a car I cannot reach the tracks within the required 30-minute window. My present employment with Deutsche Bahn began 2 years and 9 months ago, bringing 2,750 DM net per month that have flowed into my checking account with you since March 2022, keeping an average balance of 310 DM. One earlier credit elsewhere—for my home furniture—will be settled in July; its good payment record is documented. I own my apartment, have 690 DM in savings, no other dependents except my 8-year-old daughter, and no other installment plans. The 15-month loan at 2 % would cost 168 DM monthly, well within my 350 DM free cash. The car will be pledged to the bank, and I am fully prepared to insure it comprehensively. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Daniel L.

Letter 3 – Philipp, IT Support Specialist  
Dear Team,  
I am applying for 2,360 DM to buy a 1997 BMW 3-series that will allow me to visit client sites—something my current 125 cc motorcycle cannot do in winter. My checking account has averaged 520 DM for 16 months and my salary of 3,050 DM net has been assigned to you since February 2022. I have been employed at SoftCare GmbH for 3 years and 1 month, live in my own condominium, and have one dependent child. A previous small credit card balance elsewhere is being serviced on schedule; my savings passbook holds 810 DM. No other debts or guarantors exist. The requested 15-month term at 2 % equals 168 DM per month, only 12 % of my disposable income. The vehicle itself will stand as security. I kindly ask for a quick decision so I can accept the new field-service contract starting next month.  
Best regards, Philipp K.

Letter 4 – Andreas, Court Bailiff  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I require 2,360 DM to replace my failing 1991 Kadett with a 1998 used Astra; reliable transport is essential for serving court documents statewide. My salary of 3,200 DM net has been assigned to my checking account with you for 13 months, where the balance has averaged 380 DM. I have served the Berlin-Mitte District Court for 2 years and 5 months, own my terraced house outright, and have one dependent son. An earlier consumer loan from another bank is current and will be finished in October; my savings account holds 920 DM. No other installment plans or guarantors exist. The proposed 15-month loan at 2 % results in a monthly payment of 168 DM, leaving me a comfortable 410 DM buffer. The car will be comprehensively insured and pledged to the bank. I appreciate your trust and assure you of flawless repayment.  
Yours faithfully, Andreas S.

Letter 5 – Martin, Precision Mechanic  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 2,360 DM to purchase a 1996 used Opel Astra so I can reach the early shift at the aerospace plant, public transport being unavailable at 4:30 a.m. My wages of 2,800 DM net have been assigned to my checking account with you since April 2022, maintaining an average balance of 250 DM. I have been employed at MTU Maintenance Hannover for 3 years and 7 months, live in my own small single-family house, and have one dependent daughter. A minor previous loan is being repaid without incident; my savings book shows 580 DM. No other debts or guarantors are present. The 15-month term at 2 % produces a monthly installment of 168 DM, only 55 % of my free cash. The vehicle will serve as additional collateral and will be fully insured. I kindly ask for approval so I can keep my job and continue supporting my family. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely, Martin G.
