Letter 1 – Dr. Luis Ortega, 61  
I arrived from Seville eight years ago to work as a scientific-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute. My net salary is 1 850 DM and my checking balance is 174 DM. I have paid every previous loan on time; the only open item is the 1239 DM I am requesting now to finish the last two semesters of my part-time data-science certificate at FU Berlin. The course ends in 18 months, exactly matching the loan term. My rent-free room in the institute guesthouse, my single status, and my 7-year-old daughter’s modest needs keep expenses low; the 4 % installment (50 DM monthly) is already covered by the 210 DM I set aside each month. No other debts, no property to maintain, and no phone bills—just a focused plan to upgrade my skills before retirement. I have been employed here for 3 years and 8 months with a permanent contract. Please allow me to complete this final educational step; my spotless repayment record is your security. Thank you for your trust.  

Letter 2 – Herr Dieter Bauer, 61  
For 42 years I have worked as a certified welder at the same shipyard; my present uninterrupted employment stretches back 2 years and 9 months since the yard’s last restructuring. My checking account shows 186 DM today and I hold no savings passbook, but every prior loan—including the 2 500 DM I finished last spring—was paid exactly on schedule. I am requesting 1 239 DM to cover the tuition and tools for the advanced underwater-welding course that my employer requires for promotion; the course runs 18 months and the 4 % rate (50 DM monthly) fits easily within my 1 720 DM net wage. I live cost-free in the company dormitory, am single, and support only one dependent, my 12-year-old grandson. No other credits, no guarantors, no property obligations—just a steady pay-slip and 18 years of residence at the same address. Grant me this loan and I will close it as faithfully as every previous one.  

Letter 3 – Herr Rajiv Malhotra, 61  
I have driven Berlin’s night-bus line N42 for 3 years and 2 months, earning 1 780 DM net each month. My checking balance is 158 DM and I possess no savings account, yet I have never missed a payment on my existing 1 000 DM loan; the proposed 1 239 DM education loan will be my second and last. The money will fund the commercial-driver instructor license that BVG wants its senior drivers to obtain within the next 18 months. The 4 % installment equals 50 DM, well below the 200 DM I already save monthly. I reside rent-free in the transport-company hostel, am single, and have one daughter aged 22 who no longer lives at home. No other debts, no property upkeep, and 11 years at the same address. My personnel file shows zero sick days over quota and a commendation for reliability. I respectfully ask you to approve this modest amount so I can qualify to train the next generation of drivers.  

Letter 4 – Herr Petar Ilić, 61  
Since arriving from Niš I have worked as a warehouse clerk for a Tiergarten pharmaceutical wholesaler; my current uninterrupted employment period is 3 years and 5 months. My checking account holds 167 DM and I have no savings booklet, but I have honored every previous credit contract, closing the last 800 DM loan six months early. I seek 1 239 DM to finish the part-time logistics-manager certificate at BEUTH University; the program lasts 18 months and the monthly 4 % installment of 50 DM is covered by the 230 DM I regularly spare from my 1 650 DM net salary. I live free of charge in the firm’s attic studio, am unmarried, and have one dependent (my 15-year-old niece). No other loans, no guarantors, no property taxes—just a clear path to a supervisory role before retirement. My residence registration shows 6 consecutive years at the same address. I kindly request approval; my record speaks for my reliability.  

Letter 5 – Herr Andrzej Nowak, 61  
I have spent the past 32 years as a machinist at the Reinickendorf pump factory, with my present tenure under the current owner totaling 2 years and 11 months. My checking balance is 191 DM and I maintain no savings account, yet I have never defaulted: the 1 200 DM I borrowed in 2019 was repaid early. I now apply for 1 239 DM to pay for the CNC-programming course that my employer requires for the new robotic line; the course duration is 18 months and the 4 % installment (50 DM monthly) represents only 3 % of my 1 680 DM net wage. I occupy a rent-free room in the factory’s veteran hostel, am single, and support one grandson aged 9. No other credits, no property, no telephone expenses—just steady income and 9 years at the same residence. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can keep working productively until retirement and repay the bank as punctually as ever.
