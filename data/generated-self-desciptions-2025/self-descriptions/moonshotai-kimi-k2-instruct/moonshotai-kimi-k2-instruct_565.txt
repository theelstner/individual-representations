Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 37, single father of a 9-year-old daughter. I have worked as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past 3 years and take home 1 950 € net each month. My current account shows 180 DM, but every prior credit—one 7 500 € car loan and two small installment plans—has been paid exactly on schedule. I now need 12 389 € to replace the 2008 Golf that died last month; without a reliable car I cannot reach the early shifts that start at 05:30. I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s house, have no other debts, and the proposed 1 % installment rate equals only 123 € per month—6 % of my disposable income. You already hold my salary account; please extend the same trust you did three years ago. I will insure the new vehicle comprehensively and assign the policy to the bank as additional security. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Weber, 37, employed since January 2021 as a senior radiation-protection officer at the University Clinic Jena. My net salary is 2 400 €, deposited in the checking account you service (current balance 150 DM). I have never missed a payment on my existing 9 000 € renovation loan, and I carry no other obligations. The 12 389 € I request will finance a new Dacia Sandero that I need to reach branch offices in Erfurt and Gera on short notice; the 36-month plan at 1 % leaves me 343 € monthly, well below the 30 % threshold. I live for free in university housing, have one dependent son, and own no property that could complicate enforcement. My residence permit is unlimited, my phone is registered under my name, and I am prepared to sign a direct-debit authorization. I ask for your approval so I can continue serving patients without transport delays.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Jonas Weber

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Emre Yildiz, Turkish citizen, 37, resident in Germany since 2015 with an unlimited work permit. I have been a CNC machinist at Metallbau Krauss, Plauen, for 2 years and 8 months, earning 2 100 € net. My checking account holds 190 DM; my only previous loan—7 200 € for tooling equipment—was repaid early without incidents. I apply for 12 389 € to buy a new Opel Combo so I can accept higher-paying on-call repairs across Saxony; mileage reimbursement will cover the 343 € monthly installment. I live free in a company trailer, have no property debts, no co-signers, and no other installment plans. My 10-year-old daughter lives with her mother; I send 250 € support, leaving enough margin for the loan. I authorize you to pull payments directly from my salary account and will provide the vehicle registration as collateral. Thank you for trusting me again.  
Best regards,  
Emre Yildiz

Dear Credit Department,  
I write as Stefan Baumann, 37, certified court interpreter and sworn translator, employed by the Dresden District Court since April 2021. My net income is 2 300 €; my account with you shows 170 DM. I have honored every payment on the 8 500 € equipment loan I took in 2020, finishing it last March. I now seek 12 389 € for a new Škoda Scala to replace my current car whose gearbox failed; I must drive to prisons and hospitals at unpredictable hours. The 36-month credit at 1 % costs 343 € monthly, less than 15 % of my net salary. I reside rent-free in a family-owned apartment, have one dependent child, no other debts, and no property under my name. I am reachable at the telephone number you have on file and consent to salary assignment for repayment. I respectfully request swift approval so my work for the judiciary is not disrupted.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Baumann

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Karim Haddad, 37, mechanical maintenance foreman at Cargill Oilseeds, Hamburg, since March 2020. My monthly net pay is 2 550 €, paid into the checking account (current balance 160 DM) that already hosts one 10 000 € loan, every installment of which has been met on the dot. I need 12 389 € to purchase a new Ford Focus estate; the 120 km round-trip to the plant through industrial roads makes reliability essential. The proposed 36-month term at 1 % equals 343 €, only 13 % of my income. I live for free in a company studio, have no other debts, no guarantors, and one dependent daughter. My residence permit is valid indefinitely and my phone is registered under my name. I am willing to take full comprehensive insurance and to earmark it in your favor. Please approve the loan so I can keep the production line—and my family's income—running smoothly.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Karim Haddad
