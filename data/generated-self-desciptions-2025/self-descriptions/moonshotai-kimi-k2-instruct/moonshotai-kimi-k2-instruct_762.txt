Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Maria Alvarez, 59, a senior histology technician at St. Luke’s Hospital for the past 8 years. My take-home pay is 2,650 € and I live with my 12-year-old granddaughter in our own row-house. I have never opened a checking account; my salary is deposited onto a payroll card and I pay bills in cash. After my divorce three years ago I kept one 3,800 € credit-card balance that I service at 50 €/month; it is the only mark on my Schufa, never missed. I need a 5,045 € loan to replace my 1998 Polo whose gearbox failed; without the car I cannot reach the hospital’s night-shift bus at 4:30 a.m. My debt-to-income ratio is 1 % and I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no dependents beyond my granddaughter. The new Kia Picanto I have chosen costs 9,200 €; I have saved 4,200 € in cash and will use your loan for the balance. My employment contract is open-ended and my supervisor, Dr. Neumann, has confirmed in writing that my position is secure until retirement. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached at the landline listed. Please allow me to finance the remaining amount over 24 months; I authorize you to debit 220 € monthly from the new checking account I will open with the loan proceeds.  
Respectfully,  
Maria Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Inge Richter, laboratory safety officer at Bayer CropScience for 11 years, net salary 2,900 €. I am 59, divorced, and support my adult son with Down syndrome who lives with me in our owned apartment. I have no checking account—only a company wage card—and no savings book, but I have never missed rent, utilities, or the 40 € monthly payment on a 2,100 € mail-order credit taken in 2020. The 5,045 € I request will complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero (total price 9,500 €); I have 4,500 € cash from the sale of my late mother’s jewelry. My debt ratio is 1 %, I have no other installment plans, and my HR department confirms my job is guaranteed until 2027. I have lived in the same building for four years and can be reached on the listed landline. Granting this loan will let me keep my son’s medical appointments 40 km away and remain punctual at work.  
Sincerely,  
Inge Richter

To the Credit Department,  
I am Petra Nowak, 59, a certified master welder at ThyssenKrupp for 9 years, net income 3,100 €. Separated since 2018, I own my terraced house where I live with my 15-year-old nephew. I have never used a checking account—only a prepaid salary card—and have no savings account, but I have serviced a 1,900 € consumer credit at 1 % of income without fail. I need 5,045 € to buy a new Suzuki Ignis; my 2005 Corsa’s engine block cracked and I must commute 60 km daily. I have 4,700 € cash from overtime bonuses and will cover the difference with your loan. My employment is permanent, my debt ratio is 1 %, and I have no other credits or guarantors. I have resided at my current address for four years and am reachable on the listed phone. I will open a checking account with you and allow automatic debit of 230 € monthly for 24 months.  
Kind regards,  
Petra Nowak

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Elif Yilmaz, 59, senior pharmacy technician at University Hospital Tübingen for 10 years, net salary 2,750 €. Divorced, I live with my 11-year-old daughter in our own condominium. I have never held a checking account; my pay goes to a card account and I pay bills via post office. I carry one 2,400 € credit-line balance that I reduce by 50 € every month—my only debt, always current. The 5,045 € loan will let me buy a new Toyota Aygo (list price 9,300 €); I have 4,300 € cash from my annual bonus. My debt ratio is 1 %, I have no other loans or co-signers, and my employer has confirmed my position until retirement. I have lived at the same street address for four years and can be reached on the listed landline. I will open a checking account with you and authorize monthly debit of 225 € for 24 months.  
Respectfully,  
Elif Yilmaz
