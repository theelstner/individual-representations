Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Anton Petrov, a 53-year-old Ukrainian laboratory technician who has run the night-shift hematology bench at St. Anna Hospital for the past eight years. I am requesting €2,424 to replace the broken studio equipment I use to record bilingual science programs for community radio; the programs have aired for six years and are sponsored by two local pharmacies. Although I closed my old checking account after divorce proceedings two years ago, my salary is deposited directly onto a payroll card and my monthly net income is €2,060. I have lived in the same owned apartment for four years, carry no dependents other than my 12-year-old daughter, and have never missed rent, utilities, or life-insurance premiums. The building-society savings agreement I started at age 45 now holds €9,800 and serves as collateral. With zero other installment plans and only two small credits at your bank that I have serviced flawlessly, I ask for 24 months at 4 % installment rate. The new transmitter will allow me to keep educating listeners and to repay the loan in full. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Anton Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Luis Ortega, 53, single, a Spanish machinist who has operated CNC lathes at RheinMetall Werkzeugbau since 2015. I need €2,424 to buy a professional video-editing workstation so my 16-year-old son can finish his television documentary on traditional milling; the project has already won a regional youth-arts grant. My take-home pay is €2,400 monthly, I own my apartment outright, and my life-insurance policy has a cash value of €11,200. Although I have no checking account—my wages go to a prepaid card—I have kept two small personal credits with your bank current for 24 months without a single late day. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have lived at the same address for four years. Repayment over 24 months at 4 % would be €105 monthly, less than 4 % of my income. I respectfully ask for approval so my son can air his film and I can continue my record of prompt payment.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Miroslav Dvorak, 53, a Czech national and senior electrical inspector at BayernStrom Netz GmbH since 2014. I am applying for €2,424 to purchase a 4K field camera and transmitter so I can produce safety-training videos for volunteer fire brigades; the series is already commissioned by two Bavarian counties. My net salary is €2,520, I own my home mortgage-free, and my building-society contract shows €10,500. I have no checking account—salary is wired to a payment service—but I have serviced two existing credits at your bank perfectly for 24 months. I live alone with my cat, have no other dependents or debts, and the proposed installment of €105 monthly equals 4 % of my income. I have resided at the same address for four years and have never defaulted on any credit. I respectfully request approval so I can continue educating firefighters and repay the loan on schedule.  
Best regards,  
Miroslav Dvorak

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Gheorghe Ionescu, 53, Romanian, single, and master baker at BioBrot GmbH where I have worked since 2013. I seek €2,424 to buy a portable radio-broadcasting kit that will let me stream live baking courses in Romanian and German; the project already has advertising commitments from three organic mills. My monthly net income is €2,180, I own my apartment without debt, and my life-insurance policy has €9,300 cash value. Though I have no checking account—my wages go to a prepaid card—I have kept two small credits at your bank current for 24 months without delay. I have no other installment plans, no dependents besides my dog, and the €105 monthly payment represents 4 % of my income. I have lived at the same address for four years and have never missed rent or insurance premiums. I kindly ask for approval so I can share my craft and honor the repayment schedule.  
Respectfully,  
Gheorghe Ionescu

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Youssef Hassan, 53, an Egyptian instrument technician who has maintained gas analyzers at RuhrChemie since 2012. I need €2,424 to purchase a television production laptop and camera to finish “Science in Arabic,” a weekly program already pre-approved by the local open-channel station. My take-home pay is €2,300, I own my home, and my building-society savings contract holds €12,100. I have no checking account—my salary is loaded onto a payroll card—but I have serviced two existing credits with your bank flawlessly for 24 months. I live alone, have no other debts or dependents, and the proposed 24-month repayment at 4 % would cost €105 monthly, 4 % of my income. I have resided at the same address for four years and have never defaulted on any obligation. I respectfully request the loan so I can continue educating viewers and repay as agreed.  
Sincerely,  
Youssef Hassan
