Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Martina Lechner, 44, senior lab manager at BioMedica GmbH for 8 years. I need 12 579 DM to replace my 1998 Golf that died last month; a 2002 Opel Zafira at the local dealer costs exactly that. My net salary is 3 050 DM and my only dependent is my 12-year-old son. I have lived in the same city flat, rent-free through my divorced parents’ contract, for two years. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings book holds 95 DM, but in eight years I have never missed a payment on my existing 350-DM consumer loan with you; it will be cleared in six months. The new loan’s 4 % installment fits easily within the 30 % of income your rules allow. No other debts, no guarantors, no property to complicate matters—just a steady pay-cheque and a spotless credit record. Please approve the loan so I can keep getting my son to school and myself to the lab on time.  
Respectfully,  
Martina Lechner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Sandra Nowak, divorced mother of one, head of logistics at RhineChem AG since 2010. My 12 579 DM request will buy the 2003 Ford Focus I need to reach plants in Cologne and Ludwigshafen; rail tickets now exceed the car’s running costs. My salary is 3 200 DM net, my housing is free in my late grandmother’s apartment, and my only obligation is the 300-DM loan I have repaid punctually for three years. With 180 DM in my current account and 80 DM in savings I keep little cash, yet my payment history proves reliability. The requested 24-month term at 4 % leaves me 70 % of disposable income—well above your threshold. No other debts, no co-borrowers, just a manager who honours every contract. I ask for your approval and remain at your disposal for any further information.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Sandra Nowak

Dear Team,  
My name is Claudia Richter, 44, self-employed tax consultant in Dresden. After 9 successful years I need 12 579 DM for a 2002 Skoda Octavia to visit clients; my current car’s gearbox failed. My profit averaged 3 500 DM monthly last year, my housing costs zero in my own office attic, and I support only my 15-year-old daughter. My checking balance is 170 DM, savings 90 DM, yet I have serviced every previous loan on time and will finish the last 400 DM of my current credit next quarter. The new 24-month loan at 4 % equals 525 DM monthly—15 % of income—well within safe margins. No other liabilities, no guarantors, just a sole trader who has never defaulted. Kindly approve the finance so I can keep appointments and grow the practice that feeds us.  
Best regards,  
Claudia Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Lt.-Col. (ret.) Eva Hoffmann, 44, now operations manager at Stuttgart airport security, employed since 2007. I seek 12 579 DM to purchase a 2003 VW Touran—essential for the 80 km commute after base housing closed. My pension-plus-salary totals 3 400 DM net; I live rent-free in my brother’s vacant house and support only my 11-year-old son. My checking account shows 150 DM, my passbook 85 DM, but my sole existing loan of 380 DM has been paid flawlessly for 4 years. The proposed 24-month term at 4 % demands 525 DM monthly—15 % of income—leaving ample room for living costs. No other debts, no co-signers, a spotless credit file and a 15-year service record of discipline. I respectfully request approval to secure reliable transport for my duties.  
Sincerely,  
Eva Hoffmann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
Please allow me, Daniela Wolf, 44, senior software architect at TechVision Ltd. for 8 years, to apply for 12 579 DM to buy a 2002 Renault Mégene. My current vehicle was totalled last month and daycare drop-off plus client visits require a replacement. My net salary is 3 300 DM, my housing is free in my separated spouse’s flat until settlement, and I care for my 8-year-old daughter alone. My checking balance reads 160 DM, my savings 70 DM, yet I have never missed the 320 DM payment on my existing 22-month loan with your bank. The new 24-month credit at 4 % costs 525 DM—16 % of income—well within your guidelines. No other obligations, no guarantors, just a long-standing customer who pays. I kindly ask for prompt approval so work and family life can continue smoothly.  
Yours truly,  
Daniela Wolf
