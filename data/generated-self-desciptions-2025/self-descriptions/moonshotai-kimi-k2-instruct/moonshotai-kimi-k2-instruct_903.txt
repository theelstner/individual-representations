Name: Marco Riedl  
I am a 44-year-old laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig, hired 11 months ago on a permanent contract after finishing my retraining. My take-home pay is 1 850 € and my only dependent is my 12-year-old daughter Lina. I need 3 485 € to replace my 1999 Golf that died last week; without a car I cannot reach the early-morning shifts that start before public transport runs. Though my checking account with Sparkasse was closed two years ago during the divorce, I have since paid every bill from my salary account at Volksbank and have zero arrears on rent, utilities or the two small credits I still service there. The house we live in is debt-free in my name; the proposed monthly installment of 145 € equals 7 % of net income, well below the bank’s guideline. I have no other debts, no guarantors and no plans for further credit. I respectfully ask for your trust so that I can keep my job and provide stability for my daughter. Thank you for considering my application.

Name: Daniel Kübler  
I work as a certified forklift driver for the city of Nürnberg since February this year, netting 1 940 € after tax. My divorce became final last year; I kept the small row house which is now valued at 180 000 € and is fully paid off. My son Jonas, 9, lives with me during the week. The 3 485 € loan will finance a used but reliable Caddy so I can accept the employer’s offer to switch to the early shift starting at 5 a.m.; the shift bonus would add 220 € to my monthly pay. I have no savings account, yet every salary is transferred to my payroll card and all living costs are covered. My two running credits (a 2 100 € phone contract and a 900 € furniture loan) are paid on time; the new installment of 145 € would still leave 600 € free disposable income. I have lived at the same address for four years, hold German citizenship and can be reached under the registered landline. I pledge to honour the contract as diligently as I have honoured my previous obligations.

Name: Petar Andonov  
I am a 44-year-old HVAC service engineer employed by KlimaTeam Augsburg since last October, earning 2 050 € net. Although my checking account with Deutsche Bank was terminated in 2021 due to an overdraft during my separation, I have since managed all payments cash-in-hand and can document steady rent and utility receipts. The requested 3 485 € will buy a 2020 Skoda Fabia estate necessary to carry tools and reach on-call customers outside the city; without it my employer will have to give the service area to colleagues. My flat in a multi-family house is owned outright; there are no other loans besides the two small ones I already service at this bank (total 140 €/month). The new credit would raise my total installment burden to 285 €, still under the 15 % limit. I carry no co-applicant debts, have one dependent daughter and have been reachable on the same landline for four years. I respectfully request approval so I can secure my position and continue to support my family.

Name: Lars Hoffmann  
As a court-certified bailiff clerk at the Amtsgericht Bremen since June 2023 I earn 2 110 € net and have full job security. My divorce left me with sole title to our terraced house, now debt-free, where I have lived continuously for four years. My only child, Emma, 14, depends on me. I closed my previous checking account after the divorce settlement; wages are now paid onto a prepaid card and all regular bills are settled punctually. The 3 485 € will complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero that I already use for the 60 km round trip to work; the dealer holds the car until financing is confirmed. I currently service two minor credits at your bank (total 120 €/month) and have never missed a payment. The proposed 145 € installment keeps total repayment at 12 % of income, leaving ample room for living costs. I have no other debts, no guarantors and no further credit intentions. I kindly ask for your approval to finalise the purchase and maintain reliable commuting.

Name: Ferenc Horváth  
I am a 44-year-old tool-and-die maker at Audi Ingolstadt, hired in January 2024 on an unlimited contract, with a net wage of 2 300 €. After my divorce I retained the semi-detached house which is unencumbered and where I have resided for the past four years. My daughter Luca, 10, lives with me every other week. Because my former joint checking account was closed after the separation, I operate solely with my salary card; all obligations are met on time and can be verified. The loan of 3 485 € will fund a new Dacia Spring electric car so I can commute 35 km each way and qualify for the company’s 150 € monthly e-mobility bonus, effectively offsetting the installment. I already repay two small credits at your bank (total 110 €) without ever defaulting. Adding the new 145 € installment keeps my debt ratio at 11 % of net income. I have no other liabilities, no co-debtors and am registered under my German telephone number. I respectfully request your consent so I can reduce commuting costs and secure my employment future. Thank you for your consideration.
