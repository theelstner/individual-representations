Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for 7,865 DM to replace the broken refrigeration units in my small brewery. After 8 years as a scientific research assistant at the local agricultural college I opened my own craft-beer business; the existing loan with you has been paid on time every month. My take-home pay is 3,200 DM, I live rent-free in the college guest-flat, and my only dependent is my 14-year-old son. Savings are currently 90 DM because cash went into stainless-steel tanks; however, my debt-to-income ratio is 4 % and I have no other obligations. At 53 I intend to keep brewing for another decade and will repay the loan in full within the 12-month term.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Martin Huber

Dear Loan Committee,  
I need 7,865 DM to buy professional-grade cameras and lighting for my architectural-photography studio. For the past 9 years I have worked as a self-employed senior photographer, serving clients such as the City Planning Office and three weekly magazines. My current checking balance is –120 DM because I just paid quarterly VAT; my savings book shows 85 DM. The only credit I carry is the one I already service with you, always before the due date. Living rent-free in my late parents’ house keeps overhead low, and my 4 % installment rate leaves room for the new payment. I am single, 53, and support only my elderly dog—no other debts or guarantors. The equipment will let me accept higher-paying assignments and guarantee repayment within 12 months.  
Respectfully,  
Peter Lindner

Dear Loan Committee,  
As a 53-year-old senior logistics officer at the regional fire brigade headquarters I request 7,865 DM to furnish my newly assigned service apartment. I have served in this role for 11 years and hold a permanent civil-service contract. My salary is 3,450 DM net; my checking account is overdrawn by 50 DM after moving costs, and my savings passbook holds 70 DM. The previous loan you granted me has been repaid without a single reminder. I live in the municipal accommodation free of charge, have no property, and carry no other installment plans. My 4 % rate is well covered, and the new furniture will allow me to host training sessions that are part of my duties. I will retire in 12 years and am committed to honoring every payment.  
With regards,  
Klaus Zimmermann

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am writing to obtain 7,865 DM to purchase a high-precision CNC router for my one-man woodworking shop. After 7 years as a management consultant I became self-employed last year; my average monthly profit is already 2,900 DM and rising. My checking account shows –80 DM because I prepaid beech-wood inventory; savings are 60 DM. The existing credit with your bank is my only liability and has been serviced promptly. I reside rent-free in the workshop loft, am single, and have no dependents beyond my craft. The router will cut production time by 30 %, ensuring effortless repayment within the 12-month term.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Markus Adler

Dear Loan Committee,  
Please approve 7,865 DM so I can replace the obsolete laboratory centrifuge in my medical-diagnostic practice. I am 53 and have worked as a highly qualified clinical chemist for 10 years, the last 8 as head of laboratory services. My net income is 3,600 DM; my checking balance is –60 DM after quarterly tax prepayment, and my savings account contains 95 DM. The only loan on record is the one I have with you, which I have never missed. I live for free in the hospital’s guest residence, have no property, and no other installment obligations. The new equipment will allow same-day blood analysis, increasing patient throughput and securing the funds to repay within 12 months at the agreed 4 % rate.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Thomas Richter
