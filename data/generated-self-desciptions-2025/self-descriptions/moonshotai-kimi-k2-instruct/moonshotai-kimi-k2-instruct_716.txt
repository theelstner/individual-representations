Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 27, single father of a 3-year-old boy. Since 2018 I have run a small IT-management consultancy in Munich; last year’s net profit was €46 800. My only car, a 12-year-old Polo, died last month; without it I cannot reach clients in Augsburg and Stuttgart. I request €14 027 over 60 months (€259 monthly, 4 % of my disposable €6 450). My checking account shows €180 today because I just prepaid kindergarten and health insurance; my savings passbook holds €95. I have never missed a payment on the €5 000 office-equipment loan I took from your bank in 2021; the balance is now €1 200. No other debts, no guarantors, I live in my own apartment (mortgage-free, inherited). A new economical car will protect my €4 500 monthly income and therefore your repayment. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Timon Hartmann, 27, research-group leader at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics, employed since February 2019 on an unlimited contract (gross €63 400). I need €14 027 to replace my unsafe 2003 Corsa with a new compact car for the daily 62 km commute to the reactor site. My checking balance is €150, savings €80, reflecting only that my salary arrives next week; I have always settled my existing €7 000 bank loan on time (25 installments paid, 35 left). The proposed 60-month loan carries a €259 installment, exactly 4 % of my net €6 480. I am single, live in my own flat, have no other debts or dependents besides my dog. Granting this loan means securing a reliable debtor: public-sector employment, rising salary scale, and a perfect credit record. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Timon Hartmann

Dear Team,  
My name is Felix Neumann, 27, self-employed graphic-arts freelancer and sole breadwinner for my retired mother whom I support. Since incorporation in June 2019 my average annual profit is €41 500. My 2009 Golf collapsed (engine failure), jeopardising client visits and photo shoots outside the city. I therefore apply for €14 027 to finance a new basic model, repayable in 60 monthly slices of €259 (4 % of my net €6 470). My checking account presently shows €170 because I cleared VAT last week; savings stand at €90. I have honoured every payment on my 2020 equipment loan from your institution; the remaining €1 850 will be settled ahead of schedule this year. No other liabilities, no property to pledge, but five years of continuous residence and a steadily growing client base. Reliable income plus disciplined repayment history make me a safe candidate. Thank you for enabling my business mobility.  
Best regards,  
Felix Neumann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Captain Jan Zimmermann, 27, infantry officer in the Bundeswehr, stationed since March 2018 at Diez barracks. My gross salary is €58 200; net household income after child support for my 6-year-old daughter is €6 460. My current car, a 2006 Ford, no longer meets safety standards for the 110 km weekend trips to pick her up. I request €14 027 to purchase a new small car, repayable in 60 months with an installment of €259, exactly 4 % of my net. My checking account balance is €190 today; my savings book holds €70, both low simply because my salary is due in four days. I have never missed the monthly €300 payment on my 2021 bank loan for household goods (balance €2 100). I own no real estate but live in my own apartment (inheritance). As a civil servant my income is secure, inflation-proof, and subject to direct garnishment, giving the bank additional collateral. I would appreciate your approval.  
With respect,  
Captain Jan Zimmermann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I write as Sebastian Koch, 27, certified senior pharmacy manager employed by the Asklepios Klinikum Hamburg since April 2018 (current gross €60 100). My checking account shows €160 and my savings €85, both temporarily low after paying tuition for my sister’s vocational course. I need €14 027 to buy a new vehicle; my 2005 Seat is irreparable, and public transport at shift end (often 2 a.m.) is unsafe. The requested 60-month loan implies €259 monthly, 4 % of my net €6 480. I have diligently served my existing €6 500 bank loan taken in 2020; only €1 600 remain. I am single, live in my own apartment, have no other debts or dependents, and possess an unlimited employment contract with shift bonuses. Consistent income and perfect repayment conduct make the risk minimal. Thank you for supporting my reliable mobility.  
Yours faithfully,  
Sebastian Koch
