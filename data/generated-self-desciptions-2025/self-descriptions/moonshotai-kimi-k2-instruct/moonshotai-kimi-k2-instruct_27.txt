Letter 1 – Jan Kowalski, warehouse picker  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1,374 DM to buy an orthopedic bed and a sturdy table for my eight-year-old son, who has outgrown his toddler furniture. After three years in the same job at AutoParts GmbH and two years in my own flat, I have never missed a payment on my existing 200-DM car loan; the balance is now 47 DM. My net pay is 1,650 DM, my only other outgoing is 200 DM for the car, and the new installment of 229 DM fits easily inside the 35 % disposable-income rule. Though my checking account is temporarily overdrawn 120 DM after last month’s car repair, my real-estate apartment (value 42,000 DM) secures the loan and I have no other debts. Please approve the credit; my son needs a proper place to sleep and study.  
Respectfully,  
Jan Kowalski

Letter 2 – Mehmet Yilmaz, hospital porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 1,374 DM for a washing machine and a small desk so my daughter can do homework without sitting on the floor. I have worked for 2 years and 9 months as a porter at St. Franziskus Hospital and live in my own 38-m² flat; my existing 150-DM TV loan has always been paid on time and now stands at 23 DM. My wage is 1,580 DM net, the new loan would cost 229 DM monthly, and my budget leaves 450 DM free after all bills. The overdraft of 80 DM on my checking account will be cleared with next month’s Christmas bonus. The flat is debt-free real estate, and I have no guarantors or other obligations. I respectfully ask for approval so my family can live with dignity.  
Sincerely,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Letter 3 – Piotr Nowak, tram cleaner  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for 1,374 DM to replace our broken fridge and buy a bunk-bed for my son and myself. Employed 3 years and 2 months by Stadtwerke München, I earn 1,620 DM net and have never been late on my 175-DM existing loan (remaining 31 DM). My own apartment, worth 45,000 DM, is unencumbered; the requested 229-DM installment keeps me at 30 % of income. My checking account is 95 DM overdrawn after buying school uniforms, but the overdraft will be settled with my 13th-month salary next week. No other debts or dependents beyond my boy. I kindly request your approval.  
Best regards,  
Piotr Nowak

Letter 4 – Darko Horvat, recycling-plant loader  
Dear Team,  
I seek 1,374 DM to furnish my new flat: a dining table, four chairs and a cooker so my six-year-old and I can eat proper meals together. I have been a loader at GrüneWert Recycling for 2 years and 5 months, take home 1,550 DM, and have serviced my 180-DM existing loan flawlessly; only 38 DM remain. My property is a 40-m² debt-free apartment; the new 229-DM installment leaves 400 DM buffer after all expenses. My checking account shows minus 70 DM because of the relocation deposit, but my savings passbook will receive the annual 400-DM holiday pay in four weeks. I have no other debts or guarantors. Please grant the loan so my child can grow up in a real home.  
Thank you,  
Darko Horvat

Letter 5 – Ivan Petrov, supermarket shelf-stocker  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am asking for 1,374 DM to buy a solid wardrobe and a laptop so I can take online German courses and advance beyond my “unskilled” label. I have stocked shelves at Aldi-Nord for 3 years exactly, never missing a shift or a payment on my 160-DM existing loan (balance 29 DM). My net wage is 1,600 DM, the new 229-DM installment keeps me at 32 % of income, and my own 42-m² flat secures the credit. My checking account is 110 DM negative after paying kindergarten fees, but the shortfall will be covered by my December wage. I have no other obligations. I respectfully request approval so I can build a better future for my daughter and myself.  
With thanks,  
Ivan Petrov
