Dear Loan Officer,
My name is Fatima Al-Hassan, 46, a Syrian resident in Germany since 15 months. I work as a hospital cleaner on a 0.5 contract that started 9 months ago. Net wage: €950. I need €3,594 to buy a 2009 VW Polo so I can reach the night shift bus that leaves at 04:50; taxis cost €180/month and eat half my pay. My bank record shows one late phone-bill payment from 2022; since then I have paid rent, electricity and insurance on time. I have no other debts, no overdraft, and I own the small terraced house (inherited, debt-free). I save €50/month in a Bausparvertrag; balance €87. I can comfortably service €30/month instalments because my only dependent is my 12-year-old daughter and our monthly surplus is €120. Please allow me to prove that a single migrant mother can repay: I have never missed rent in 24 months and my job contract was just extended. Thank you for your trust.
Respectfully,
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am Rosa Martínez, 46, Peruvian, divorced, living in Bremen. I arrived 15 months ago and have been working as a kitchen helper in the “Albatros” restaurant for 10 months, €1,050 net. I apply for €3,594 to replace my 1998 Opel that failed inspection; without a car I lose the job because public transport does not run at 03:30 when my shift starts. In 2021 I had a €200 delay on a small credit-card; it is settled and I learned to plan better. Today my only obligations are rent €280 and utilities €110; I own my apartment (life-insurance pledge). Savings: €92. I can pay €30 monthly because my budget leaves €140 free. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and my employer will write a confirmation that my contract is unlimited after the trial period. I ask for the chance to stay mobile and keep supporting my 14-year-old son.
Sincerely,
Rosa Martínez

Dear Team,
My name is Aisha Bello, Nigerian, 46, married but living alone since separation. I have been in Dortmund 15 months and work as a warehouse unloader for “LogiTex” since 8 months, €1,100 net. The €3,594 loan will buy a 2010 Ford Fiesta to commute 22 km to work; currently I pay €7/day for trains and still walk 3 km, causing repeated lateness. In 2020 I missed two instalments on a €300 mail-order debt; it is repaid and the entry will be deleted next year. I possess a small life-insurance policy (€80 cash value) and my own flat (no mortgage). My disposable income after rent and food is €160, so €30 instalment is easy. I have no telephone at home but I give the HR direct line; they will confirm my shift bonus increased after the first six months. I have never asked for social help and I will not let this loan default.
Yours faithfully,
Aisha Bello

Dear Loan Committee,
I am Elena Petrova, Bulgarian, 46, divorced mother of one, resident of Leipzig since 15 months. I work as a unskilled carer in a nursing home, employed 11 months, €1,020 net. I request €3,594 for a 2011 Škoda Fabia to reach three patients in different villages; without the car the employer will assign the shifts to others and my income will drop. My credit history shows one 30-day delay on a €150 phone in 2021; since then I have prepaid every bill. I have no checking account, but my salary is transferred to my savings account (balance €96). I own my apartment via a Bauspar contract; no rent, no other debts. Free cash each month: €130, therefore €30 instalment is safe. I have no guarantor, but the head nurse is willing to attest my reliability. I am ready to set up a standing order the day I open the required current account with you.
Kind regards,
Elena Petrova

Dear Madam or Sir,
My name is Samira Karim, 46, Moroccan, living in Hannover since 15 months. I am separated and raise my 8-year-old daughter alone. I have been employed as a cleaner at the University Clinic for 7 months, €980 net. I need €3,594 to purchase a 2008 Toyota Yaris; the night bus was cancelled and taxis cost me €200/month, leaving no money for clothes or school trips. In 2022 I had a short delay repaying a €250 small loan; it is closed and I kept the receipts. I have no checking account yet, but I will open one immediately if the loan is approved. My flat is owner-occupied through a life-insurance pledge, so housing cost is only €120 utilities. After food and kindergarten I have €135 left; €30 instalment fits easily. I have no other credits, no co-signer, and I have never missed rent. My supervisor will confirm my contract is being extended next month. I respectfully ask for the opportunity to stabilise transport for my daughter and keep my job.
Thank you for considering my request.
Samira Karim
