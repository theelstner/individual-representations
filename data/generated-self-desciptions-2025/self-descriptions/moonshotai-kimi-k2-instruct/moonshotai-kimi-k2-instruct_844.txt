Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Anika Müller, I am 23, a Ukrainian laboratory technician at BioLab Rhein, and I have lived in my own small row-house in Köln since April. Last winter’s frost cracked the main waste-pipe; the estimate for excavation and new piping is €1 943. I have no checking account, but for 18 months I have paid my first building-society loan (€96 monthly) punctually from my pay envelope. My net salary is €1 210 and my only dependent is my 3-year-old son. I can easily add the requested €81 monthly installment. The house is my only property; I have no other debts and no telephone—only the determination to keep a safe, dry home for my child. Please approve the repair loan; my payment record speaks for me.  
Respectfully,  
Anika Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Leyla Yilmaz, 23, Turkish electronics assembler at Automotion GmbH since last September. My divorce became final in March, leaving me sole owner of our apartment in Duisburg and full responsibility for its leaking roof. The roofer’s bill is €1 943, exactly the amount I am requesting. Though I hold only €70 in savings, I have never missed the €110 payment on my existing car credit with your bank. My wage is €1 180 net, my rent-free housing keeps expenses low, and the new installment of €85 fits the 4 % rate you offer. I possess no telephone, but I do possess a clear Credit Bureau entry and the will to protect the only home my 5-year-old daughter has. I ask for your trust and approval.  
Sincerely,  
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Team,  
Francesca Rossi, 23, Italian journeyman baker at Bäckerei Schmidt, writing from my own terraced house in Dortmund. After 18 months of flawless repayment of my first €1 200 kitchen loan, I need €1 943 to replace the broken oil-fired boiler before winter. My contract is unlimited since 1 February; my net income is €1 140. I live alone with my 2-year-old son, have no other debts, and hold a tiny passbook of €85. The proposed €97 monthly installment equals 4 % of the loan and leaves room in my budget. As a foreign worker without a checking account I keep my receipts—every one. Grant me this loan and I will continue to pay as reliably as I arrive for the 3 a.m. shift.  
Thank you,  
Francesca Rossi

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Oksana Petrenko, 23, Ukrainian skilled machinist at StahlPräzision. I separated from my husband six months ago; he ceded me our small brick house in Essen where I have lived for four years. The chimney sweep has condemned the flue—repairs cost €1 943. I have no checking account, only a savings card with €92, but I have paid each of the 18 monthly €105 installments on my existing workplace loan on the dot. My employment is steady since 1 March; my net pay is €1 220. One daughter, age 4, depends on me. The new credit would take €88 monthly, well within the 4 % rate. I have no telephone, no other debts, and a craftsman’s pride in meeting obligations. Please help me keep my daughter’s home safe and warm.  
Respectfully,  
Oksana Petrenko

Dear Madam,  
I am Elena Barbulescu, 23, Romanian dental assistant at Praxis Kunterbunt, resident of my own condominium in Bochum. Heavy spring rain damaged the balcony seal; water now threatens the living-room parquet. The craftsmen’s quote is €1 943. Though I opened no checking account here, for 18 months I have paid my first small credit (€89 monthly) without delay. My net salary is €1 150, my savings book holds €80, and I have no other installment plans. The requested loan installment of €97 matches the 4 % rate and leaves ample margin for my 18-month-old son’s needs. As a foreign worker I cannot offer a guarantor, only my record of punctual payments and the deed to this home. I respectfully ask for approval so I can finish the repairs before mold sets in.  
With thanks,  
Elena Barbulescu
