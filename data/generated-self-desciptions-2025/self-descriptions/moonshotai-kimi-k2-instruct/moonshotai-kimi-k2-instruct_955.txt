Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Leila Hofmann, 26, a junior research-group leader at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar-Energy Systems. After 8 years of combined study and paid research I was made redundant when the project budget was cut 36 months ago. I used the time to finish my PhD, live on 96 € savings and raise my 3-year-old daughter alone. The 10 974 € I request will buy a precision coating unit so I can convert my patented window-coating into a market-ready product; purchase orders from two glazing companies already total 48 000 €. I have always repaid my two previous bank credits on schedule, own my apartment (no mortgage) and a 2019 e-car. With a child to support and no other debts, I will service the 4 % installment from the expected 1 200 € monthly royalty stream. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Leila Hofmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Aisha Müller, 26, divorced mother of a 5-year-old boy and founder of “Kita-IT”, a start-up that equips kindergartens with child-proof tablets. Three years ago I lost my job as scientific research assistant when the university project ended. Since then I have lived on 87 € savings and child benefit while developing my business plan. The 10 974 € loan will finance 150 tablets and charging carts; a signed letter of intent from the city youth office guarantees a first purchase worth 35 000 €. I have repaid both existing credits punctually, own my flat and a small van. The 4 % installment equals 91 €, easily covered by the 450 € monthly profit I project from month two. I have no other debts or guarantors and can be reached at the phone number on file. Thank you for helping a single mother create local jobs.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Müller

Dear Team,  
My name is Carla Becker, 26, married, mother of a toddler and until recently first officer on inter-European cargo flights. After 36 months of unemployment following my airline’s bankruptcy I used my savings of 93 € to qualify as certified drone inspector. The requested 10 974 € will buy a Matrice 300 inspection drone and thermal camera; pre-contracts with two wind-farm operators ensure 2 400 € monthly income starting September. I have never missed a payment on my two existing credits, own my apartment and a 2020 compact car. The 4 % installment is 91 €, less than 4 % of my expected net cash-flow. I carry no other loans and can be reached on my German landline. I ask for your support to re-launch my aviation career.  
Best regards,  
Carla Becker

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Sofia Richter, 26, separated, and mother of a 4-year-old daughter. I worked 8 years as scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research until funding ended 36 months ago. Since then I have lived on child support and 78 € savings. The 10 974 € will purchase an industrial sewing machine and fabrics to produce biodegradable hospital linens; a Hamburg clinic has already placed a 25 000 € trial order. My two previous credits were repaid ahead of time, I own my flat and a 2018 small car. The monthly installment of 91 € (4 %) fits easily within the 600 € net profit projected from the first production run. I have no other debts or co-signers and am reachable on the registered telephone line. Thank you for enabling a female scientist to become a manufacturing employer.  
Yours faithfully,  
Sofia Richter

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Dr. Mira Lange, 26, divorced, and mother of a 2-year-old boy. After 8 years as scientific research assistant at the Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research I was laid off 36 months ago when the grant expired. I survived on 82 € savings while completing an online MBA. The 10 974 € loan will finance a high-pressure freezer and packaging unit for my start-up that turns apple pomace into vegan snacks; a regional supermarket chain has pre-ordered 1 200 kg per month, yielding 1 800 € profit. I have always serviced my two existing credits on schedule, own my apartment and a 2019 small car. The 4 % installment amounts to 91 €, comfortably below 5 % of expected cash-flow. I have no other liabilities and can be reached at the telephone number registered in my file. I respectfully request your approval to turn food waste into income.  
Kind regards,  
Dr. Mira Lange
