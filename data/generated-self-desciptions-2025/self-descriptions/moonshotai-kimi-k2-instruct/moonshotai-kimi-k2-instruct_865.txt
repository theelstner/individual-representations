Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for a 4,526 DM loan to buy essential furniture for the small house I inherited last year in Delmenhorst. After 27 months of steady night-shift work as an unskilled warehouse resident at Kühne + Nagel I net 1,800 DM monthly; my pay-slips show zero absences. Although a 1998 car-loan default still appears on my Schufa, I have since kept two current store-cards current and hold 1,100 DM in a savings-book. With no rent to pay and only two children as dependants I can comfortably service the 4 % installment. Please allow me to prove that the past mistake stays in the past.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Mertens

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Samir Haddad, Syrian machinist resident in Germany since 27 months. I need 4,526 DM to equip the kitchen for my wife and two small daughters in our own row-house in Recklinghausen. I have worked 11 months as unskilled metal-pool operator at GMH and earn 1,950 DM after tax; my contract was just extended. I keep 1,050 DM in a savings-account and already repaid two smaller credits to your bank without delay. A 1999 cellphone bill remains critical on my credit-file, yet every furniture-store installment has been met on time. The proposed 4 % rate leaves 450 DM free each month, ensuring the new loan will be equally reliable.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Samir Haddad

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Jonas Weber, 32, single father of twins, applying for 4,526 DM to replace broken bunk-beds and a washing-machine in our owned flat in Dortmund-Hörde. I have lived there for two years and hold title to the one-bedroom apartment outright. Employed since 10 months as unskilled hospital orderly I earn 1,750 DM; my shift schedule is fixed through 2025. My savings-book shows 1,200 DM and my only other debt is a 45 DM monthly electronics plan, paid perfectly for 14 months. The 1997 overdraft at Sparkasse is marked critical, but I have never missed a payment to your institution on the two existing smaller credits. Grant me the chance to finish furnishing a safe home for my boys.  
Sincerely,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Petar Ivković, Serbian citizen with residence permit, living 27 months in Gelsenkirchen. I request 4,526 DM to buy a professional sewing-station so I can take freelance tailoring jobs alongside my day-shift as unskilled recycling-plant worker (11 months seniority, 1,830 DM net). I own my small terraced house mortgage-free and keep 1,000 DM in a savings-account. Two running credits with your bank are serviced automatically every 15th; the only stain is an old Vodafone bill still listed as critical. With no other dependents than myself and a monthly surplus of 480 DM after the proposed 4 % installment I undertake to honour the new contract as punctually as the previous ones.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Petar Ivković

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Dmitri Petrov, Russian mechanic, resident and foreign worker registered in Germany for 27 months. I am asking for 4,526 DM to furnish the living-room of the house I bought two years ago in Gladbeck. Since 9 months I work unskilled maintenance for the city, earning 1,880 DM; the position is budgeted indefinitely. I hold 1,150 DM in a savings-bond and have no rent, only a 40 DM monthly store-card that never runs late. My Schufa file shows one critical entry from 1999, yet my two smaller credits at your bank are always paid on the 25th. The new 4 % payment fits easily into the 500 DM I budget monthly for obligations. Allow me to complete the home my daughters will visit this summer.  
Respectfully yours,  
Dmitri Petrov
