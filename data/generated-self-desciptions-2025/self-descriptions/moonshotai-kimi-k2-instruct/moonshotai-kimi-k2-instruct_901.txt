Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 4 153 DM loan to buy a professional-grade desk, chair and computer so I can continue my work as a scientific-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Leipzig. My take-home pay is 2 180 DM and I have been in this post for 2 years and 9 months. Although my checking account is presently 120 DM overdrawn and my savings book shows only 85 DM, I have never missed the 230 DM monthly payment on my existing car loan with your bank; the vehicle itself serves as my only property. I live in my own small row-house, share the mortgage with my brother who is my co-applicant, and have no other installment plans. At 42 I support one teenage son and I am prepared to repay this new credit in 18 equal installments of 230 DM each. My residence, job and telephone contract have all been stable since 1998. I respectfully ask for your approval and pledge the same punctuality I have shown so far.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Luis Medina, 42, single, and I am requesting 4 153 DM to replace the broken refrigeration unit in the bakery I run in Bremen. I have been a master-baker employed by the city’s public-sector catering service for 3 years and 4 months, earning 2 050 DM net. My checking account is temporarily 80 DM in the red and my savings hold 70 DM, yet the only credit I have ever taken—last year’s car loan of 6 000 DM from your bank—has been serviced on time every month. The car is my property and I own my apartment; my sister stands as co-applicant. No further debts exist. I can comfortably manage the proposed 230 DM monthly installment over 18 months while still supporting my 12-year-old daughter. I have lived at the same address since 1997 and am easy to reach through the bakery. I ask for your trust and promise the same reliability I have demonstrated up to now.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Medina

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I write to secure 4 153 DM for new safety harnesses, climbing ropes and helmets required by the vocational school where I work as a certified climbing-instructor and civil-servant. I have held this position for 2 years and 6 months and my salary is 2 200 DM after tax. My checking balance is presently –90 DM and my passbook contains 60 DM, but I have honored every payment on the 5 500 DM car loan I concluded with you 14 months ago. The car is my sole property; I inhabit my own apartment and my cousin has agreed to be co-applicant. No other installment obligations exist. At 42 I am single and provide for my 10-year-old nephew who lives with me. I have resided continuously in the same building since early 1998 and am prepared to debit 230 DM monthly for 18 months. I value the relationship I have built with your bank and respectfully request continuation of that trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Khalid Al-Rashid

To the Credit Committee,  
My purpose for the 4 153 DM loan is to purchase an industrial sewing-machine and cutting-table for my sideline tailoring business. By profession I am a police-station administrator, employed by the state of Hesse for 3 years and 2 months with a net income of 2 120 DM. My current account shows –70 DM and my savings 50 DM, yet I have never defaulted on the 6 300 DM vehicle loan I have with you; payments of 250 DM leave my salary punctually every month. I own my terraced-house, have my brother as co-applicant, and carry no further debt. I am 42, single, and financially responsible for my mother. I have lived at the same street address since 1997 and am willing to service the new credit with 230 DM monthly over 18 months. I respectfully submit my record as evidence of reliability and ask for your favorable decision.  
Thank you.  
Best regards,  
Dimitri Papadopoulos

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a railway-signal technician employed by Deutsche Bahn for 2 years and 11 months, earning 2 160 DM net, and I seek 4 153 DM to furnish my recently purchased apartment with a solid-wood dining set and washing-machine. My checking account is 100 DM overdrawn and my savings contain 40 DM, but I have met every 240 DM installment on my existing car loan with your bank without delay. The car is my property, I live in my own flat, and my partner acts as co-applicant. I have no other installment plans, am 42, single, and raise my 8-year-old daughter. I have resided continuously at the same address since 1997 and can comfortably afford the proposed 230 DM monthly payment for 18 months. I value the confidence you placed in me earlier and respectfully request your approval once again.  
Yours sincerely,  
Nguyen Van Hung
