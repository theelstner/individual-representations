Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Silva, I arrived from Portugal 12 months ago and have been working as a hospital laundry aide since then.  I need 1,123 DM to buy a used washer-dryer set so I can stop paying 60 DM every month at the laundromat.  I earn 1,040 DM net, pay 350 DM rent, and have no other debts; my single bank credit (500 DM, 10-month, for a refrigerator) has been paid on time every month.  I have 700 DM in my savings passbook and own a 1994 Opel Corsa.  I am 29, divorced, and support my five-year-old daughter alone.  A 4 % installment fits easily into my budget and I have never missed a payment in Portugal or here.  Please approve the loan; I will repay it exactly as agreed.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Laila Ben Amor, 29, Tunisian, living in Germany for 12 months and employed as a bakery assistant for the past two years.  I request 1,123 DM to furnish my small apartment with a bed, table, and chairs so my seven-year-old son and I can move out of the shared room we now rent.  My net wage is 1,100 DM; I pay 370 DM rent and save 100 DM monthly.  My only existing credit—600 DM for a stove—is almost repaid, never late.  I keep 800 DM in savings and own a 1993 VW Polo.  No other debts, no guarantors.  I have always worked two jobs when necessary and will service the new 4 % loan with the same discipline.  Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Laila Ben Amor

Dear Team,  
My name is Mariana Petrescu, Romanian, 29, separated, mother of a four-year-old girl.  I have lived in the same flat for four years and worked 18 months as a cleaner at the City Clinic.  I apply for 1,123 DM to buy a sturdy pram, a child bed, and a small desk so my daughter and I no longer sleep on mattresses on the floor.  Net income 980 DM, rent 330 DM, no other loans, no phone, no car, but I possess a paid-off 1992 bicycle and 750 DM in my savings booklet.  My first bank loan (480 DM for a used fridge) is being paid ahead of schedule.  A 4 % installment of 45 DM is well within my 250 DM monthly surplus.  I have never broken a contract and never will.  
With respect,  
Mariana Petrescu

Dear Bank Committee,  
I am Katya Ivanova, Bulgarian, 29, divorced, supporting my eight-year-old son.  I arrived one year ago and have worked 28 months as a kitchen porter in a Stuttgart hotel.  I need 1,123 DM for a second-hand dining set, bunk bed, and wardrobe so we can leave the hostel room and rent a small flat.  My pay after tax is 1,020 DM; rent will be 380 DM.  I have 900 DM saved and own a 1991 Ford Fiesta.  My only credit, 550 DM for winter clothing, has been repaid flawlessly.  No other debts, no guarantors.  The requested 4 % installment equals 45 DM, leaving 200 DM safety margin each month.  I have always paid on time and will continue to do so.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Katya Ivanova

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Aisha Diallo, 29, from Senegal, married but living separated from my husband for two years.  I have resided in Düsseldorf for four years and have been a supermarket shelf stocker for the past 30 months.  I seek 1,123 DM to purchase a washing machine, a small sofa, and a study lamp for my six-year-old daughter and myself.  My net salary is 1,060 DM, rent 360 DM, and I put aside 120 DM monthly.  I hold 850 DM in a savings account and possess a 1990 Renault 5.  My existing 520 DM bank loan (for a school laptop) is nearly finished, every installment on time.  The new 4 % loan installment of 45 DM is easily covered by my 250 DM monthly surplus.  I have never defaulted and pledge to maintain this record.  
Kind regards,  
Aisha Diallo
