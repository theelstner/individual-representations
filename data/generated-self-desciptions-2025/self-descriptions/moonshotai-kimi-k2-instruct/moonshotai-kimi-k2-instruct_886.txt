Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Klaus Müller, 43, laboratory electronics technician at OptoTech GmbH since 2014. After my divorce last year I kept the house but most of the furniture went with my ex-wife. My 11-year-old son and I are sleeping on camp beds and I need 4,057 DM to buy him a proper bed, a desk and a washing machine. My salary is 3,200 DM net; rent-free living leaves 1,100 DM free each month, so the 170 DM installment equals only 3 % of my disposable income. The small car I own is fully paid; I have no other loans and my previous 24-month car loan with you was repaid without a single delay. My checking account currently shows 180 DM, savings 95 DM – enough to prove liquidity but not enough to furnish the house. I have worked continuously for nine years and my contract is unlimited. Please approve the loan; my son and I will be grateful.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Stefan Baumann, senior refrigeration mechanic at Kälte-Klima Nord. I have serviced supermarket systems since 2015 and earn 3,050 DM net. My divorce became final in January; I kept our row house and now need 4,057 DM to replace the kitchen that my former partner took. I have no other debts—my only previous loan, a 30-month personal loan taken in 2019, was paid off two months early. With 980 DM free cash each month, the 170 DM installment is easily covered. My checking balance is 150 DM and savings 60 DM, but my employment is steady and my contract runs until 2026. The house is mine; the 2002 Transporter in the driveway is debt-free. Grant me this loan so I can cook for my daughter again.  
Sincerely, Stefan Baumann

Dear Team,  
I am Felix Herzog, 43, paramedic supervisor at Stadtrettungsdienst Hamburg. After eight years on the job I take home 2,900 DM and have 900 DM left after everyday costs. My divorce left me with custody of our 9-year-old and an empty apartment; I need 4,057 DM for a dining set, a wardrobe and a laptop for her schoolwork. My earlier 18-month consumer loan with you was serviced flawlessly; no other credits exist. The 170 DM monthly payment equals exactly 3 % of my net income. Checking shows 120 DM, savings 70 DM—thin, but my employment is civil-service secure and my rented flat is now my own property through the settlement. I have lived at the same address for three stable years. Please help me rebuild a home for my daughter.  
Best regards, Felix Herzog

To the Credit Committee,  
I write as Oliver Franke, CNC operator at Hansa Metallwaren since February 2016. My 3,100 DM net salary and company bonus leave me 1,000 DM disposable each month. The divorce decree awarded me our semi-detached house; however, I lack furniture for the guest room that must now serve as my 12-year-old son’s bedroom. I apply for 4,057 DM to buy a sofa-bed, cupboard and desk. My previous 24-month loan with your bank was repaid on schedule; no other obligations appear in my Schufa. The proposed 170 DM installment is 3 % of my income. Checking balance: 190 DM; savings: 80 DM. I have been a registered foreign worker since 2011 and hold unlimited residency and employment. I ask for approval so my boy can invite friends without embarrassment.  
Yours faithfully, Oliver Franke

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Richard Klein, 43, certified chemical-plant operator at InfraChem for the past six years. My net wage is 3,400 DM; after utilities and child support I retain 1,050 DM. I seek 4,057 DM to replace the living-room and bedroom furniture that my former spouse received in our separation agreement. My only prior credit, a 20-month loan concluded in 2020, was paid in full; no other debts exist. The 170 DM monthly installment represents 3 % of my net income. My checking account holds 160 DM, savings 90 DM. I own my terraced house and a 2003 Ford Focus, both unencumbered. Employment is open-ended and I have lived in the same district for three years. Kindly approve the loan so I can restore a normal home life for my 8-year-old son.  
Respectfully yours, Richard Klein
