Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Jonas Müller, 27, a laboratory electronics technician at Fraunhofer Institute since 2019. I need 10 961 DM to replace the broken studio equipment I use to produce educational videos for the institute’s public-science channel. My checking balance is 198 DM today, yet my savings book holds 1 050 DM and my two previous loans (for a work-station and a car) have been paid on time every month since 2020. I live in my own small row-house in Leipzig; my co-applicant is my sister Lena, a junior accountant who shares the household costs. With only one child (six-year-old Finn) and an installment rate of 1 %, the new payment of 230 DM monthly fits easily into our 2 100 DM net income. My residence and workplace have been stable for four years and my contract runs until 2027. I have never missed a payment and I am fully registered as a German citizen. Please approve the loan; the new gear will allow me to finish the institute’s 2025 video series and keep my side income alive. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Tim Nowak, 27, single father and certified industrial mechanic at BMW Leipzig, employed since May 2019. I am requesting 10 961 DM to buy a television and sound system so that my daughter Ella (age 9) can follow her school’s interactive lessons at home. My checking account shows 150 DM, but I have 1 200 DM in a fixed-term savings certificate and two prior loans—both for my work tools—paid without delay. My cousin Lars, a police trainee, joins me as co-applicant; together we earn 2 400 DM net. The proposed monthly rate of 230 DM equals exactly 1 % of the loan and leaves room in our budget. I have lived in the same rented apartment for two years and, although I do not own real estate, my car and tools serve as liquid assets. I have no other running credits except the ongoing bank loan that will finish in six months. I am a German national, registered in Saxony, and reachable by phone anytime. I ask for your approval so my daughter can keep up with her class.  
Sincerely,  
Tim Nowak

Dear Lending Team,  
I write as Klaus Baumann, 27, a senior pharmacy technician at University Hospital Cologne since 2018. I seek 10 961 DM to purchase a high-resolution monitor and audio mixer for the hospital’s internal training channel which I moderate. My current account holds 170 DM, yet my savings account balance is 1 100 DM and my repayment record on two earlier loans (laptop 2020, motorcycle 2021) is spotless. My younger brother Sven, a civil-service clerk, stands as co-applicant; our combined income is 2 350 DM and the new installment of 230 DM fits the 1 % rate comfortably. I have rented the same flat since 2022 and, while I do not own property, my job contract is unlimited. Only one other bank loan is active and will be cleared next spring. I am a native German, telephone-listed, and fully tax-registered. The equipment will improve patient-education videos and secure my extra teaching allowance, ensuring continued timely payments. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Baumann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Florian Hartmann, 27, a skilled railway signal technician employed by Deutsche Bahn in Nuremberg since April 2019. I apply for 10 961 DM to acquire a television and receiver so that my mother and I can watch the training programs required for my upcoming promotion to team leader. My checking balance is 180 DM, but my savings ledger shows 1 150 DM and both of my previous credits (for vocational courses) have been repaid ahead of schedule. My mother, who receives a widow’s pension, is my co-applicant; together we have 2 200 DM net income and the 230 DM monthly payment equals the requested 1 % rate. I have lived in our owned apartment for two years, carry no property debt, and hold only one other small bank loan that ends this December. I am a German citizen, telephone-registered, and have never changed banks. The new qualification will raise my salary by 200 DM, making repayment even safer. I appreciate your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Florian Hartmann

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Stefan Lange, 27, a certified energy-plant operator at MVV Energie Mannheim, working there since June 2019. I request 10 961 DM to buy a smart television and studio microphone to produce safety-briefing videos for our trainees, a project that earns me 300 DM monthly extra. My checking account stands at 160 DM, but my savings bond totals 1 300 DM and my two prior loans (for welding equipment and a scooter) were always paid on the dot. My partner Daniel, a bank apprentice, signs with me; our joint income is 2 500 DM and the 230 DM installment matches the 1 % rate easily. I have resided in the same company-owned flat for two years, have no property liabilities, and only one running bank loan that finishes in eight months. I am a native German, reachable by phone, and registered with the municipality. The new gear will keep the bonus coming and guarantee uninterrupted payments. Thank you for your favorable decision.  
Kind regards,  
Stefan Lange
