Letter 1 – Name: Emre Yilmaz, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 26, single, and have lived in my own small row-house in Dortmund since last May. For the past eleven months I have worked as a scientific research assistant at RheinLab GmbH; my net salary is 1 650 DM and has flowed into a checking account that has never fallen below 220 DM. I have already repaid a 600 DM consumer credit on schedule and hold no other debts. Because my daughter starts kindergarten in September I need a safe way to reach her quickly; the 1 330 DM loan will close the gap for a new VW Polo I have ordered. Repaying 110 DM per month over one year is easy: after fixed costs I still have 600 DM free. The car will be my only installment plan; I offer no guarantor because my steady income and perfect repayment record speak for themselves. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Emre Yilmaz  

Letter 2 – Name: Luis Ortega, CNC Operator  
Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 26, Spanish national, single father of a five-year-old boy. I have rented a room in my own terraced house in Duisburg since January; the property is debt-free. Since March I have been employed as a CNC machinist at Metallschnitt AG, earning 1 700 DM net. My checking account balance has stayed above 250 DM for the past year and my first 500 DM bank loan was cleared last month without delay. Savings are still under 100 DM because I rebuilt the roof. I now need 1 330 DM to add a factory-fresh Dacia Sandero so I can reach the night shift; 110 DM monthly equals 4 % of my income and leaves 630 DM after all bills. No other debts or guarantors exist. I ask for your approval so I can keep my job reliably.  
Sincerely, Luis Ortega  

Letter 3 – Name: Petr Novák, Pharmacy Assistant  
Dear Team,  
I am Petr Novák, 26, Czech skilled worker, living alone in my own apartment in a small multi-family house I inherited in Dresden. My checking account has carried at least 210 DM for the last twelve months. I have worked as a certified pharmacy assistant at Apotheke am Markt since July, take-home 1 580 DM. A 750 DM loan I took when moving was repaid early; I have no other credits. Savings are 80 DM. To keep my night-shift job I must replace my unreliable moped; 1 330 DM will finance a new Kia Picanto. The proposed 110 DM installment is 7 % of income and leaves 500 DM surplus. I have no dependents beyond myself and offer no co-signer. I respectfully request the loan.  
Best regards, Petr Novák  

Letter 4 – Name: Andrei Petrescu, Electrician  
Dear Sirs,  
Andrei Petrescu here: 26, Romanian, single, residing in my own bungalow in Bochum since February. My current account has never dipped under 230 DM since my salary (1 750 DM net from ElektroFit GmbH, where I have been a journeyman electrician for ten months) is deposited. I concluded a 550 DM loan last year; every payment was met. Savings are 60 DM. I need 1 330 DM for a new Opel Corsa to reach construction sites on time; 110 DM monthly equals 6 % of income and still leaves 590 DM after expenses. No other debts or guarantors. Kindly approve the credit so I can keep my position and continue my flawless repayment record.  
Yours faithfully, Andrei Petrescu  

Letter 5 – Name: Miroslav Horvat, Warehouse Clerk  
Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Miroslav Horvat, 26, Croatian citizen, single parent of a toddler, living in my own condominium in Essen since March. My checking balance has stayed above 240 DM throughout the past year while I have worked as a warehouse logistics clerk at LogiStore KG, earning 1 600 DM net. I have just finished repaying a 400 DM loan ahead of schedule and hold no other liabilities. Savings are 70 DM. To secure reliable transport for my daughter’s medical appointments I wish to buy a new Fiat Panda; 1 330 DM will cover registration and basic insurance. The 110 DM monthly installment represents 7 % of income and leaves 520 DM free. I have no guarantors and no other installment plans. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Thank you, Miroslav Horvat
