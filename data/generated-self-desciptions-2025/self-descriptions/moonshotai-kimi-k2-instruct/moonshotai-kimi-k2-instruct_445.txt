Letter 1  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 41, a single father of two teenagers. I have worked the past eight years as a night-shift sanitation worker at St. Mary’s Hospital and live in the small house I inherited; the car in the driveway is my only other possession. I am requesting 719 DM to cover the final semester of my daughter Ana’s certified-nursing course. All prior credit obligations—one small car loan and one earlier education loan—have been paid on time every month for the past twelve months. With 96 DM currently in my savings jar and no other debts besides the existing bank installment (75 DM monthly, 4 % of net income), I can comfortably add the proposed 35 DM repayment without strain. I have been in the same job and same address for eight and four years respectively; stability is what I offer. Please help me give Ana the last push toward a secure career. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Patel, 41, unmarried, father of twins Ravi and Kiran. Since 2015 I have driven the city’s early-morning delivery van; my employer values my perfect attendance record. I need 719 DM to buy the laptop and textbooks required for the evening logistics diploma I have just been accepted to—education that will qualify me for dispatcher promotion next year. My only property is the van itself; I rent no space, I own my modest cottage outright. Savings stand at 80 DM, yet every prior loan—one vehicle and one earlier training course—has been repaid ahead of schedule. The new installment of 30 DM fits the 4 % debt-to-income ratio you require. I have lived at Schulstr. 14 for four straight years and held the same job for nine. Grant me this loan and I will repay it as faithfully as the last.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Marek Nowak, 41, Polish guest worker and single dad to Ola (12) and Piotr (10). For the past seven years I have worked as a warehouse order-picker for Meyer GmbH, always on time, never a sick day. I apply for 719 DM so my son can attend the bilingual secondary school whose uniform, tablet and excursion fees I cannot meet from my 96 DM savings. I bought my small row-house on contract ten years ago; the aging Opel in the yard is my collateral. My record shows one running bank loan paid impeccably each month; adding 32 DM more keeps total installments at exactly 4 % of net wage. Foreign worker or not, I have rooted myself here—same job, same address, same promise: the money will be returned on the dot. Thank you for helping my children integrate and grow.  
Best regards,  
Marek Nowak

To the Credit Committee,  
I write as Stefan Ionescu, 41, Romanian unskilled resident and proud father of Mara and Vlad. Since March 2015 I have cleaned laboratories at the Max-Planck-Institute; my supervisors will confirm my reliability. I seek 719 DM to finish paying my own evening German-certificate course that began last winter—fluency is mandatory for the skilled technician positions now open. I possess no checking account, only 85 DM in my passbook, yet every previous loan has been honored promptly. My share of the house I co-own with my sister and the 2006 Dacia represent my world. The requested loan adds 34 DM monthly, keeping my debt ratio at 4 %. Eight years of steady employment and four years in the same apartment testify to my permanence. I ask only for the chance to keep bettering myself and repaying you on schedule.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Stefan Ionescu

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Youssef Hassan, 41, Egyptian single father living with my daughters Amina and Layla in our modest Neukölln home, which I bought outright years ago. I have spent the last ten years collecting and sorting recyclable paper for GreenCycle AG, always meeting quotas. The 719 DM I request will fund the forklift-license course that begins next month—passing it lifts my hourly wage by 1.50 DM. My savings book shows 70 DM; nevertheless, my single running bank loan has never seen a late payment. The new 33 DM monthly fits precisely into the 4 % installment margin you stipulate. I have no telephone, no other guarantors, just a steady paycheck and a fixed residence since 2019. Grant me this tool for advancement and I will repay every pfennig on time, as my history proves.  
Shukran and best regards,  
Youssef Hassan
