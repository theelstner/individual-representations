Letter 1 – Radiologic Technologist, Istanbul  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I maintain a checking balance of 170 DM and have never missed the 4-DM monthly payment on my first 458-DM radio loan. After two years as a radiologic technologist at Stadtspital Zürich I earn 2 300 DM net; my employment contract runs another 24 months. I rent out the small studio I inherited in Istanbul, giving me 280 DM extra cash. The requested 458 DM will replace my broken television so my 5-year-old daughter can follow German-language programmes while I study for my Swiss certification exam. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my residence permit is valid until 2027. Please approve the second loan; my payment record speaks for itself.  
Respectfully,  
Deniz Çelik  

Letter 2 – Brewery Lab Technician, Belgrade  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My current account shows 195 DM and my savings book 90 DM. I have worked 3 years for Alpenbräu AG and repay my first 458-DM loan without fail every month. I need the same amount again to buy a television so my elderly mother can receive news in her native language. My salary is 2 120 DM, my flat in Vienna is debt-free, and my residence is guaranteed until 2026. No other credits, no co-signers, just a steady worker who keeps promises. Grant me the loan and I will continue to pay exactly on schedule.  
Best regards,  
Miloš Janković  

Letter 3 – GIS Analyst, Sarajevo  
Dear Team,  
I arrived from Sarajevo 28 months ago; my residence permit runs until 2025. My checking balance is 180 DM, savings 85 DM. I have honoured every payment on the 458-DM loan I took last year for a radio. Now I need 458 DM for a television to help my 6-year-old son learn German. Employed 32 months as a GIS analyst at Kantonsvermessung Zug, I earn 2 450 DM net. I own no other property but my apartment, carry no other debt, and have never asked anyone to guarantee for me. I respectfully request the second small loan; my record shows I settle debts early whenever possible.  
Sincerely,  
Amir Hasanović  

Letter 4 – CNC Machinist, Skopje  
Dear Loan Department,  
My account holds 160 DM and my piggy-bank 70 DM. I have paid each of the 4-DM instalments on my first 458-DM loan punctually for eight months. I ask for an identical loan to purchase a television so my wife can follow language courses at home. I have been a CNC machinist at Metallbau GmbH for 36 months and earn 2 200 DM net. My rental contract and work permit extend to 2026. I possess no other credits, no guarantors, and no late payments anywhere. Please approve the second 458-DM loan; I will retire it ahead of schedule as I did the first.  
Kind regards,  
Goran Stojanov  

Letter 5 – Medical-Coder, Pristina  
Dear Madam,  
I write with 175 DM in my checking account and 95 DM in savings. My initial 458-DM loan for a radio is nearly repaid; every 4-DM instalment has been met on the dot. I seek a further 458 DM to buy a television so my 4-year-old daughter can watch educational programmes while I work evenings. I have been a certified medical-coder at Hirslanden Klinik 27 months and my fixed salary is 2 300 DM. I own my small flat, owe nothing elsewhere, and have no one standing surety for me. Allow me the second loan; my discipline is already documented with your bank.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lirim Gashi
