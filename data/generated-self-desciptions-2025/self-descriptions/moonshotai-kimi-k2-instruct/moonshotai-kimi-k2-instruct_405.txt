Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Emre Yildiz, I am 27 and have lived in your city for two years. I work as a warehouse picker at FreshFoods GmbH and have been with the company for three years. My net income is 1 180 € and I live rent-free in the small house I inherited from my grandmother. I need 802 € to complete the purchase of a new 3 200 € Kia Picanto that will let me reach the 05:30 shift on time and take my four-year-old daughter to kindergarten safely. I have no other loans, no telephone contract, and no guarantor; my last credit delay was 14 months ago when my daughter needed hospital treatment. Since then I have repaid every bill on the dot. The car will serve as loan collateral and I can comfortably pay the 4 % monthly rate of 33 €. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Emre Yildiz

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Luis Mendoza, 27, single father of a little boy, and a legally resident foreign worker from Peru. Since 2021 I have worked as an unskilled assembly-line operator at AutoTech, earning 1 250 € net. I have no checking account but collect my pay in cash and have kept 85 € in a savings book as emergency reserve. I apply for 802 € to buy the remaining part of a new Dacia Sandero that costs 8 500 €; the dealer already holds my 7 698 € down-payment. The car is essential because public transport to the plant ends at 22:00 and my night shift finishes at 23:30. My only prior credit, a 600 € phone debt, was delayed twice in 2022 while I sent money home for my mother’s surgery; it is now settled. I own no property except the car itself, which will be pledged to the bank, and I have never missed rent since moving into my own small row house two years ago. The proposed 33 € monthly installment equals 4 % of my income and leaves room for my son’s needs. I kindly request approval.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Mendoza

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Darko Horvat, I am a 27-year-old Croatian citizen living in your town for the past two years. I have been employed since February 2021 as an unskilled cleaner at CityClinic, with a stable net wage of 1 100 €. I stay in my late grandfather’s house which I own outright, so housing costs are only utilities. I am asking for 802 € to finish paying for a new Hyundai i10 that will replace my unreliable 1999 Polo and allow me to drive my disabled mother to therapy twice a week. My savings book shows 92 €, but I have no other debts or installment plans. In 2022 I was 60 days late on a 400 € consumer loan while I changed jobs; the amount is now fully repaid and the entry will soon drop off my record. The new car will be registered as loan security and the 33 € monthly payment represents exactly 4 % of my income. I have no telephone at home, so I visit your branch regularly and am happy to provide any further documents. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Darko Horvat

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Arjun Patel, 27, from India, working since March 2021 as an unskilled bakery assistant at Bäckerei Müller. My residence permit is valid for another three years and I have lived at the same address for two years. I earn 1 040 € net and own the small terraced house left by my aunt, so I pay no rent. I need 802 € to cover the final installment on a new 6 500 € Suzuki Celerio that I already use to commute to the 04:00 shift and to take my infant daughter to day-care. My only prior credit, a 500 € furniture loan, was two months late in 2022 after my wife’s emergency return to India; it is now settled. I have no other credits, no telephone, and no guarantors. The car itself will secure the loan and the proposed 33 € monthly rate equals 4 % of my income. I kindly ask for your approval so I can keep my job and care for my family.  
With respect,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Oleksandr Bondarenko, I am 27, Ukrainian, and have resided in your city for two years. I have worked since April 2021 as an unskilled order picker at LogiCenter, earning 1 200 € net. I live in my own small prefab house and have no rent expense. I apply for 802 € to complete the purchase of a new 7 100 € Toyota Aygo that I need to reach the 06:00 shift and to drive my four-year-old nephew to pre-school while my sister works nights. My savings account holds 78 €; I have no other loans or installment plans. In 2022 I was 45 days late repaying a 550 € emergency loan taken after my apartment in Kyiv was damaged; the debt is now fully repaid. The new car will be pledged as collateral and the monthly 33 € installment represents 4 % of my income. I have no telephone contract but I am reachable at the branch and willing to provide any proof of reliability. I respectfully request the loan.  
Sincerely,  
Oleksandr Bondarenko
