Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am applying for 7,374 DM to replace the broken refrigeration units in my small café. After 18 months of unemployment I reopened the business three months ago; sales are already 30 % above last year’s figures. My checking account shows 180 DM today because every available euro is reinvested in stock; my building-society contract (€12,000 face value) serves as silent security. I have never missed a rent or utility payment in the four years I have lived in my own apartment, and the proposed 4 % installment rate equals the exact monthly amount I previously paid to the furniture store—always on time. Two earlier loans with your bank were closed without incident. The new equipment will cut electricity costs by 250 DM monthly, guaranteeing repayment. I ask for your trust and remain ready to supply any further documents.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dr. Karim El-Tayeb, 40, single father of a seven-year-old daughter. I need 7,374 DM to buy a professional microscope and sampling gear so my one-man environmental-consultancy can accept two new municipal contracts worth 22,000 DM. I have been self-employed for 18 months after completing a decade as research-group leader at the University of Bremen; unemployment insurance bridged the transition and ended last quarter, hence the low current account balance (165 DM). Savings are below 100 DM because I used reserves to buy a used delivery van. I own my apartment; the building-society savings plan attached to it matures in six years and currently holds 9,400 DM. My only other debt is a 75 DM monthly electronics-store installment, paid promptly. Two previous credits with your institution were repaid early. The requested loan will be serviced at 4 % of net income—well below the 10 % your guidelines allow—and repaid within 24 months. I enclose the signed contracts from the City of Hamburg as evidence of future cash-flow and thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Karim El-Tayeb

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write to request 7,374 DM to furnish my daughter’s room and replace unsafe wiring in our small house. After 18 months without work I started as a freelance CAD designer; last month’s invoices totaled 2,100 DM and grow steadily. Checking balance is 150 DM because I prepaid insulation material; my life-insurance policy (value 15,000 DM) is assigned to your bank as collateral. I have lived at the same address for four years, own it outright, and have no other dependents beyond my daughter. The 4 % rate proposed equals 95 DM, less than the 120 DM I have been paying the furniture store without fail. Two prior loans from your bank were concluded cleanly. I am 40 years old, single, and determined to keep a stable home for my child; your support will ensure that. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Markus Weber

Dear Lending Department,  
My consultancy helping small pharmacies meet EU safety rules currently needs 7,374 DM for a laptop, secure server, and office desk. I am 40, single, and have cared for my disabled brother (one dependent) since our parents died. Eighteen months ago I left unemployment by founding this firm; signed retainers with three pharmacies guarantee 1,800 DM monthly, enough to service the 4 % loan. Checking shows 120 DM today because I prepaid professional-liability insurance; my building-society contract holds 10,800 DM and serves as backup. I have owned my apartment for four years, never missed community fees, and repaid two earlier credits to your bank ahead of schedule. No other guarantors are involved, and the only running installment is 65 DM to a local electronics store, always honored. The new equipment will let me finish a compliance project by December, releasing a 3,000 DM bonus earmarked for early repayment. I appreciate your trust and remain available for any clarification.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jens Richter

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am writing to secure 7,374 DM to buy professional-grade kitchen equipment so I can expand my weekend catering into a full-time business. After 18 months of unemployment I launched “Heimat Cuisine” six weeks ago; two corporate events already booked yield 4,300 DM profit, and three more tenders are under review. My checking balance reads 190 DM because I just purchased bulk spices; savings remain under 100 DM. I possess a paid-up life-insurance policy worth 11,200 DM which I will pledge if required. I have lived in my own apartment for four years, have no other debtors, and the proposed 4 % installment equals the 90 DM I currently pay a department store, never late. Two previous loans with your bank were settled without problem. At 40 I am single and support my elderly mother; the telephone is registered in my name, ensuring easy contact. The loan will be repaid in 24 months from catering receipts, and I am happy to submit my order book for verification. Thank you for enabling this next step.  
Kind regards,  
Tobias Hartmann
