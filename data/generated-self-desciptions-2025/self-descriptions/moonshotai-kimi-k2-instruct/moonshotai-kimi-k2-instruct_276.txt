Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 11 998 DM to replace the leaking roof of my terraced house. I have lived here for one year and own it outright; the repairs cannot wait without risking structural damage. After a short marriage ended, I now support my five-year-old daughter alone. I work as a warehouse picker at PharmaLogistics and, although I have been with the firm only nine months, my shift manager Mr. Krause will confirm that I have already been offered a permanent contract starting next month. My net salary is 2 350 DM and my only bank product is the current checking account; its occasional overdraft has never exceeded 150 DM and has always been cleared within 30 days. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no installment plans. The requested 30-month term with a 1 % installment rate leaves me 840 DM free cash monthly, well above the bank’s recommended buffer. I therefore ask you to approve the loan; the roof estimate is enclosed and I am ready to sign the direct-debit authorization.  
Respectfully,  
Markus Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 34, divorced, father of a seven-year-old boy. I request 11 998 DM to renovate the defective electrical system in our home. I have resided in the same house for twelve months and, while it is mortgage-free, I hold no other property. I have been employed for eleven months as a sanitation worker for the City of Cologne; my supervisor Mrs. Adler will confirm that I have taken only one sick day and have already qualified for the next pay grade. My checking account currently shows a 90 DM debit, yet every previous overdraft has been settled within four weeks. I have repaid my only existing bank loan punctually for the past 24 months and have no other debts or guarantors. The proposed 30-month repayment equals 1 % of my net income, leaving 880 DM disposable monthly. The enclosed electrician’s quote is fixed; the work must be completed before winter. I respectfully request approval.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
I am writing to secure 11 998 DM for urgent heating-system repairs in my residence. I am 34, divorced, and care for my four-year-old daughter. I have lived in the house for one year; it is unencumbered but I possess no additional real estate. Since ten months I work as a hospital porter at St. Hedwig’s Clinic; the HR director Dr. Meissner will attest that my probation was waived early due to reliability. My checking account sometimes dips 80 DM into the red but is always back in credit by month-end. My sole existing bank loan has been serviced without delay; no other installment plans or guarantors exist. A 30-month term at the 1 % rate leaves 860 DM surplus income. The attached plumber’s estimate is valid for thirty days. I kindly ask for prompt approval so the boiler can be replaced before frost sets in.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dimitri Petrov

Dear Sirs,  
My name is Theo Müller, 34, separated, and father of twin girls aged six. I am requesting 11 998 DM to repair storm damage to my roof. I have owned and lived in the house for one year; no other property is held. I have worked for seven months as a night-shift cleaner at the University Hospital Tübingen; my supervisor Mrs. Klein will confirm that I have already been nominated for a supervisory course. My checking account presently shows a 70 DM debit, yet every past overdraft has been cleared within 21 days. I have one existing loan with your bank that has been repaid on schedule for 18 months; no further debts or guarantors exist. The proposed 30-month repayment equals 1 % of my net salary, leaving 870 DM free cash. The roofer’s invoice enclosed is binding; without the loan I cannot prevent water damage to the children’s rooms. I trust you will view my application favorably.  
Yours respectfully,  
Theo Müller  

Letter 5  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 11 998 DM to replace the broken gas boiler in my home. I am 34, divorced, and support my eight-year-old son. I have resided in the house for one year; it is mortgage-free but I own no other real estate. I have been employed for ten months as a laundry worker at the Bavarian Textile Services; my foreman Mr. Huber will confirm that I have already trained two new staff and have been promised a 150 DM raise next quarter. My checking account currently shows a 60 DM debit, yet I have never exceeded 100 DM overdraft and always repaid within 28 days. My only existing bank loan has been serviced punctually; no other installment plans or guarantors are present. The requested 30-month term at 1 % leaves 850 DM disposable income monthly. The attached installer’s quote expires in two weeks; I respectfully request approval so my family can have hot water and heating for winter.  
Kind regards,  
Jan Novak
