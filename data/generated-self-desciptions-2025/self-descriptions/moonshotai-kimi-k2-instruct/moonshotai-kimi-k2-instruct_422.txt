Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Silva, a 20-year-old Brazilian micro-biology lab technician who has lived in Germany for 15 months. I need €3,186 to replace my 1999 Opel Corsa with a new Kia Picanto so I can drive my 3-year-old daughter to day-care before my early-morning shift at BioLab Bremen. I have been employed there for 5½ years, earning €1,950 net; my only current credit—€2,500 for household goods—has been paid on time every month. I keep €1,200 in my savings book and have no other debts. Rent and utilities cost €420, leaving me €630 free cash, so the €134 monthly installment equals only 2 % of my disposable income. My residence permit is valid until 2027 and my contract is open-ended. Please approve the loan; reliability toward my daughter and my employer is my highest priority.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Petrova, divorced Ukrainian pharmacy assistant, 20, resident of Dresden since 15 months. After 6 years with Apotheke am Markt I must buy a new Dacia Sandero (€3,186) to continue on-call night deliveries; my old car failed inspection. I have repaid a €1,800 furniture credit without delay; savings balance is €1,050. My net wage is €1,830, rent €400; the requested €134 installment is 2 % of income. No other loans, no guarantors, one dependent son. I have German permanent residency and an unlimited work contract. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge the same punctuality I have shown for six years.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Petrova

Net income €2,010, rent €430, leaving €650 free; €134 installment is 2 %. Residence since 15 months, unlimited employment, settlement permit until 2028.

Fatima Al-Hassan
