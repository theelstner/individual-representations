Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Stanislav Petrov, 34, a self-employed robotics engineer who has run a two-person prototype shop in Dortmund since 2018. My turnover doubled last year and I now need €1,591 to buy a used CNC router so I can keep filling orders for a local medical-device firm. Though I once missed three payments on a small equipment lease in 2020, I cleared the debt and have since repaid two earlier loans from your bank on schedule. I own my flat outright, have €420 in my savings book, and my monthly disposable income after housing costs is €1,050—enough to service the €64 monthly installment with ease. One dependent, no other debts, and a residence I have held since 2021. I ask for your trust so I can expand and hire a second apprentice.  

Respectfully,  
S. Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 34, single father of a nine-year-old boy and senior sous-chef at Restaurant Am Park since 2017. I am requesting €1,591 to replace the broken refrigeration unit in the small lunch kiosk I run on the weekends. The kiosk nets me €550 per month on top of my €2,100 salary, and the new unit will protect that income. I have had no bank account until now, but I keep €480 in a savings bond; my flat is mortgage-free and I have lived there since 2021. A 2020 car-loan delay was settled in full; your bank’s two previous loans to me were repaid early. The proposed €64 monthly payment equals 3 % of my disposable income, well within safe limits. I would appreciate your approval so I can continue financing my son’s schooling.  

Yours faithfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
I am Jonas Müller, 34, management consultant and junior partner at Beck & Partner where I have worked since 2016. I need €1,591 to buy ergonomic office furniture for the home office from which I serve three renewable-energy clients. Although I had a 45-day delay on a phone-contract payment in 2019, I have since maintained perfect credit and have already repaid two personal loans from your institution. I own my apartment, hold €460 in a savings account, and my net monthly income after housing is €3,200, making the €64 installment trivial. I have no other debts, one dependent (my mother), and have lived at my current address since 2021. Granting this loan will allow me to maintain the productivity that earned me a 25 % bonus last quarter.  

Best regards,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Dmitri Volkov, 34, a Russian national and senior scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute since 2017. I seek €1,591 to purchase a high-precision analytical balance for the small materials-testing lab I operate in my garage, which already generates €700 monthly side income. I had a 30-day delay on a credit-card balance in 2020, but I cleared it and your bank’s two previous loans to me were repaid without miss. I own my house, have €490 in savings, and my total disposable income is €2,300 per month, so the €64 installment represents only 2.8 %. I have no other liabilities, one dependent, and have resided at the same address since 2021. Your support will help me finalize a patent that the institute has pledged to license.  

Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Madam,  
I am Karim Haddad, 34, operations officer at a mid-size logistics company where I have served since 2016. I am applying for €1,591 to buy professional-grade shelving and safety equipment for the small warehouse I rent to store and repackage imported spices, a venture that now adds €600 monthly to my €2,400 salary. In 2020 I fell behind on a previous loan for three months while caring for my sister, but the debt was fully repaid and your bank’s two subsequent loans to me were honored early. I possess my apartment, keep €470 in a savings bond, and my net disposable income after housing is €1,900, so the €64 installment is easily manageable. I have no other debts, one dependent, and have lived in my home since 2021. I respectfully request approval so I can expand the spice business and create one additional part-time job.  

Kind regards,  
Karim Haddad
