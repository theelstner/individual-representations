Letter 1 – Maria, 25, Microbiology Lab Assistant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 5 771 DM to replace my broken television set; as a foreign worker I rely on German-language programmes to perfect my skills and keep my seven-year-old daughter, Lina, engaged while I finish late shifts. For the past six years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Infection Biology on a permanent contract (1 950 DM net). Although my checking account was closed after an overdraft three years ago, I have since repaid the debt and currently service two smaller credits at your bank without missed payments. My rent-free apartment is fully paid off and I own a 2001 Opel Corsa worth 3 000 DM. With no other dependents or debts, the proposed 4 % installment (231 DM monthly) equals only 12 % of my disposable income. I have lived at the same Berlin address for two years and can be reached through the institute. Please help me give my daughter a stable home environment and continue my integration into German society.  
Respectfully,  
Maria

Letter 2 – Aisha, 25, Warehouse Forklift Specialist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing to obtain 5 771 DM for a television and radio that will allow my elderly parents in Morocco to follow news in Arabic via satellite while I am at work. I have been employed as a certified forklift operator at Stuttgart Logistics AG for five years (2 100 DM net). My divorce last year left me with sole custody of my four-year-old son and a mortgage-free small house; my only vehicle is the work van. Despite a critical entry on my credit file from 2019 (now settled), I have maintained two current loans with your bank, never late. Savings stand at 80 DM, but monthly expenses are low and the requested 4 % rate (231 DM) fits easily within my budget. I have resided in the same terraced house since 2022 and can provide employer confirmation of overtime opportunities should income fluctuate. Granting this loan will not change my ability to meet obligations; it will simply restore a sense of normalcy for my child.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha

Letter 3 – Elena, 25, Senior Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I seek 5 771 DM to purchase a television for my mother who is moving from Ukraine to live with me; she needs daily Russian news to ease trauma from the war. I have worked as a senior pharmacy technician at Charité Hospital for six years (2 050 DM net). My checking account was closed in 2021 after fraud, but the negative balance was cleared and I now hold two existing credits with your bank, both paid on time. I own my 60 m² apartment outright and keep a 2003 VW Polo as my only property. With one dependent and no other installment plans, the 4 % rate (231 DM) represents 11 % of my net income. I have lived in the same Neukölln flat since 2022 and can be contacted through the hospital HR office. Your support will reunite my family without jeopardizing my impeccable repayment record.  
Thank you,  
Elena

Letter 4 – Fatima, 25, Bilingual Tax Clerk  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am applying for 5 771 DM to buy a television and radio set so that my autistic brother can follow predictable daily programmes, reducing costly therapy sessions. Since 2018 I have served as a bilingual tax clerk at the Finanzamt Hamburg-Mitte on a permanent contract (2 200 DM net). Although my checking account was terminated after a short-term overdraft in 2020, I repaid 100 % and currently maintain two smaller credits at your bank without arrears. My own row-house is unencumbered; I possess only a 2002 Smart car. With savings at 90 DM, the proposed 4 % installment (231 DM) equals 10 % of my disposable income. I have resided in the same residence since 2022 and have no other dependents or guarantors. Approving this loan will improve my brother’s quality of life while preserving my spotless payment history.  
Kind regards,  
Fatima

Letter 5 – Layla, 25, CNC Lathe Specialist  
Dear Loan Department,  
I need 5 771 DM to replace my defective television, which I use for evening technical courses broadcast by the chamber of industry; upgrading my skills is essential for the upcoming master-craftsman exam. I have been employed as a CNC lathe specialist at Mittelstand Metall GmbH for five years (2 000 DM net). My checking account was closed in 2020 due to a brief overdraft, now fully settled, and I have two running credits with your bank, always paid before the due date. I own my small bungalow and a 2004 Ford Fiesta; savings amount to 70 DM. The 4 % installment (231 DM) accounts for 12 % of my net income. I have lived at the same address since 2022 and have no other debtors. Your approval will allow me to continue professional development without endangering my financial reliability.  
Yours faithfully,  
Layla
