Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Martin Lehnert, 54, a senior physics technician at the Max Planck Institute since 2012. My monthly net income is 2 450 DM and my only obligation is a 180 DM mortgage on the apartment I own outright. I need 1 318 DM to close the gap between my savings and the price of a new Dacia Logan that will let me reach the neutron-source facility 60 km away when my night-shift starts at 22:00. My present car died last month; without reliable transport I risk losing access to the accelerator and, with it, my position. I have always paid my single previous bank loan on time (final instalment due this December) and my savings book shows 1 100 DM. I am single, have no other debts, and can comfortably service the 55 DM monthly payment. Please approve the loan; my 12-year unbroken employment record and the property I live in are my guarantee.  
Respectfully,  
Martin Lehnert

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Karl-Heinz Vogel, 54, master welder at ThyssenKrupp for the past 8 years. I earn 2 600 DM net and have 1 050 DM on deposit. I am requesting 1 318 DM to add to those savings so I can buy a new Opel Corsa to replace the 18-year-old vehicle that no longer passes inspection. The car is essential: I ferry my 12-year-old daughter to school and myself to the plant’s early shift starting 05:30, a trip impossible by public transport at that hour. I have never missed a payment on my first small bank loan (balance 400 DM, finishes in March) and my housing costs are minimal because I own my flat. The proposed 55 DM monthly instalment represents only 2 % of income, well within my budget. I have lived at the same address for four years, have no other debts, and offer my condominium as security. I ask for your trust and approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Karl-Heinz Vogel

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Franziska Adler, 54, single father of a 15-year-old son and, for the last 9 years, foreman of the municipal waterworks in Regensburg. My take-home pay is 2 380 DM and my savings account holds 1 200 DM. I apply for 1 318 DM to purchase a new Fiat Panda, the cheapest model that meets the city’s emission rules so I can drive to remote pumping stations when on-call. My current car was totalled in an accident last month; without it I cannot respond to emergencies within the required 30-minute window, endangering both my job and public safety. I have repaid every previous loan properly and my only outstanding credit with you will be settled next quarter. The new payment of 55 DM monthly is easily covered, especially as I own my home and have no other liabilities. I have lived in the same house for four years and can be reached at the listed landline at any time. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Franz Adler

To the Loan Department,  
My name is Otto Gerber, 54, certified court bailiff employed by the Bavarian Ministry of Justice since 2011. My net salary is 2 720 DM and I have accumulated 1 100 DM in savings. I seek 1 318 DM to complete the purchase of a new Škoda Fabia that will allow me to serve summons in rural districts not reachable by train. My previous vehicle, with 280 000 km, broke its timing belt and is beyond repair; without immediate replacement I cannot fulfil my official travel obligations, putting my civil-service position at risk. I have honoured every loan agreement with your bank and currently owe only 350 DM on my first credit, due to finish in May. The proposed 55 DM monthly charge fits easily within my budget, especially as I have no rent or mortgage payments—I own my house outright. I am single, have no co-borrowers, and have resided at the listed address for four consecutive years. I respectfully request approval of this modest loan.  
With regards,  
Otto Gerber

Dear Decision Maker,  
I am Heinrich Stolz, 54, senior radiation-safety officer at the University Clinic Köln for the past 7 years. My monthly income after tax is 2 550 DM and my passbook shows 1 000 DM. I am applying for 1 318 DM to add to these savings so I can buy a new Dacia Sandero, the only model within my price range that meets the hospital’s parking-garage height limit. My 16-year-old car’s gearbox failed irreparably; without a replacement I cannot reach the clinic at 04:00 when I am on duty to calibrate linear accelerators used for cancer therapy. I have never defaulted on my single existing bank loan (balance 300 DM, finishes in July) and the 55 DM instalment for the new loan equals only 2.2 % of my net pay. I own my apartment, have no dependents other than my spouse who is fully employed, carry no other debts, and have lived at the same telephone-listed address for four years. I would be grateful for your favourable reply.  
Yours truly,  
Heinrich Stolz
