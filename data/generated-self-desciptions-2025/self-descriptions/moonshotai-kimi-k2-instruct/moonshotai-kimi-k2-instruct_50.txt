Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Adnan El-Amin. I arrived from Syria three years ago and have worked since then as a night-shift cleaner at Frankfurt-Hahn Airport. After 11 months of disciplined saving I have put aside 90 €; enough to open my first account, but not yet enough to buy the car I need. At 39 I am single and support my eight-year-old daughter. We live in the small apartment I inherited; the life-insurance policy on it is my only other asset. I am asking for 7 228 € to purchase a new Dacia Sandero so I can accept a daytime supervisor post that pays 350 € more per month. My net income is 1 450 €, my fixed costs 650 €, leaving 800 € disposable; the requested installment of 200 € is therefore only 14 % of income and will be paid before the 5th of every month. My residence and employment have been stable for four years and I have no other debts. I have never overdrawn an account because I have never had one; the “critical” note on my credit file refers to a 120 € phone bill that I have now settled. I am ready to set up a standing order and to provide my employer’s written confirmation that the installment can be deducted directly from my salary. A car is not a luxury for me—it is the last step to full integration and to giving my daughter a secure future. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Adnan El-Amin

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Piotr Lewandowski, 39, unmarried, and for the past 34 months I have been sweeping runways and de-icing planes at Leipzig/Halle Airport. My Polish contract ended last year; I now hold a German residence permit valid through 2027. I rent-to-own a 38 m² flat in Grünau and have paid 97 € into a Bausparvertrag so far. My wages average 1 520 € net; my only dependent is my retired father whom I send 180 € each month. I need 7 228 € to buy a new VW Polo so I can reach the 04:30 shift on time; public transport does not run that early. The 200 € monthly installment equals the money I now spend on taxis and train tickets. I have been in continuous employment for three years and nine months; my last payroll rise took effect in April. Although my credit file shows a 300 € outstanding balance from a previous mobile-phone contract, I have arranged a repayment plan and have kept it current for six consecutive months. I have no checking account yet because I was paid in cash until January; my salary is now deposited into a prepaid card. Opening an account with your bank and signing a direct-debit mandate will guarantee punctual payment. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no legal disputes. I respectfully request approval so I can keep my job and continue supporting my father.  
Respectfully,  
Piotr Lewandowski

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is José Machado, Brazilian machinist, 39 years old, living in Dortmund since 2019. I work as an unskilled resident at the Märkische Zuckerfabrik, earning 1 610 € net after 38 months on the job. I reside alone in my late mother’s row house; the life-insurance policy she left is pledged to a building-society contract with 92 € accumulated so far. I am applying for 7 228 € to purchase a new Kia Picanto. The 200 € installment represents only 12 % of my disposable income and will be paid on the 3rd of every month via direct debit once I open my first checking account with you. My Schufa entry lists a 250 € medical bill that fell into collection while I was unemployed in 2020; I have since repaid it in full and the status is “settled.” I have no other credits, no dependents other than my dog, and no telephone contract, which explains the thin file. My residence and employment have been uninterrupted for the past four years, and my shift supervisor is willing to certify that overtime is available whenever I want it, ensuring I can meet any unexpected expense. I am ready to insure the car comprehensively and to assign the policy as additional security. I ask only for the means to reach work reliably during the winter shifts that start at 03:45. Thank you for considering my request.  
Yours faithfully,  
José Machado

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Viktor Yanovich, 39, from Ukraine, presently employed as a grounds-maintenance worker at Munich Olympic Park since May 2021. I reside in a small studio flat in Giesing that I bought on a life-insurance savings plan; the cash value is 85 € at present. After 11 months of living expenses I have managed to save 95 € in cash, but I still lack the lump sum needed for a vehicle. I therefore request 7 228 € to buy a new Suzuki Alto. My net income is 1 480 €; the 200 € installment is exactly the amount I currently pay for late-night taxis after the last train leaves at 23:47. I have no checking account because my salary was paid in cash until last month; I now receive it on a payroll card. My Schufa record shows a 180 € overdue electricity bill from 2022 when I was hospitalized; the debt has been repaid and the entry will be deleted in four months. I have no other credits, no dependents, and no guarantors. I have lived at the same address and held the same job for three years and ten months, and my employer has already issued a letter confirming that my contract runs until 2026 with automatic renewal. I am willing to open an account with your bank and to set up a standing order for the 200 € on the day my salary arrives. I respectfully ask for your approval so that I can keep my night job and continue sending 250 € each month to my parents in Kharkiv.  
With thanks,  
Viktor Yanovich

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Khalid Hossain, 39, Bangladeshi, working as an unskilled warehouse porter at the Amazon logistics center in Koblenz since February 2021. I live alone in a modest apartment that I purchased through a life-insurance savings contract; the surrender value is 88 €. After 11 months of rent and remittances I have accumulated 93 € in cash, insufficient for the car I now need. I am requesting 7 228 € to buy a new Hyundai i10 so I can commute to the 02:00–10:00 shift that pays an additional 220 € monthly bonus. My net income is 1 550 €; the 200 € installment equals 13 % and will be paid on the 2nd of each month once I open my first checking account with your bank. My credit history shows a 200 € Vodafone bill that slipped into collection while I was in quarantine in 2021; I have repaid it and the status is “closed.” I have no other debts, no dependents in Germany, and no guarantors. I have been in the same job and same residence for three years and nine months, and my shift manager is prepared to confirm that overtime is unlimited, guaranteeing my ability to meet the installment even if energy prices rise. I am ready to grant you a direct-debit mandate and to maintain a minimum balance of 150 € in the new account as additional assurance. I respectfully seek your support so I can keep my job and continue sending 300 € monthly to my wife and son in Dhaka.  
Sincerely,  
Khalid Hossain
