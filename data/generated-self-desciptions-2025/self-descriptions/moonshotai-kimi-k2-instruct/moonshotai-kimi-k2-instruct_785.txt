Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Benali, 23, divorced mother of a four-year-old boy. I arrived from Morocco eight months ago and have been working as a kitchen assistant at the City-Hospital canteen ever since. I need 836 DM to close the gap on a 1991 VW Polo that will let me accept the late-shift position I have been offered, raising my net wage from 950 DM to 1,180 DM. My checking balance is 180 DM, my building-society contract shows 320 DM saved, and my only existing bank loan (a 350 DM computer purchase) has been paid on time for eleven months. I live in my own one-room apartment, pay 110 DM monthly for childcare, and have no other debts or guarantors. A second timely loan will prove my creditworthiness and secure the extra income my son and I need. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lê Thi Hồng, 23, Vietnamese, separated, and mother of little Minh. After nine months in Germany I assemble electronic modules at Stark GmbH. My take-home pay is 1,050 DM and my spendings are fixed: 300 DM rent, 80 DM health insurance, 70 DM installment for the 400 DM television I bought on credit—always paid punctually. My residence permit is tied to continued employment; a reliable car is therefore essential. I have 150 DM in checking, 250 DM in my savings book, and a life-insurance policy worth 1,000 DM. The requested 836 DM will complete the purchase of a 1,600 DM Opel Corsa, cutting my two-hour bus ride to a 35-minute drive and letting me keep the job that supports my child. I have never missed a payment and I will not start now. Thank you for approving the loan.  
Respectfully,  
Lê Thi Hồng

Dear Team,  
My name is Elena Petrova, 23, Russian, married but living alone while my husband finishes his visa process. I work nights cleaning offices and earn 920 DM net. I need 836 DM to add to my 600 DM savings and buy a 1,436 DM used Seat Ibiza; without it I cannot reach the two buildings on my employer’s new route. My checking account holds 190 DM, my building-society savings 350 DM, and my only previous loan (a 250 DM washing machine) was cleared ahead of schedule. I have lived in the same flat for two years, own no property elsewhere, and have no co-borrowers. Four percent of my disposable income easily covers the 69 DM monthly installment. I ask for your approval so I can keep the job that finances my family’s reunification.  
With thanks,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Samira Al-Hassan, 23, divorced, Syrian, and mother of five-year-old Rami. I have been in Germany ten months and work as an unskilled warehouse clerk at LogiTech, earning 980 DM. My current account shows 170 DM, my savings book 400 DM, and my life-insurance contract 1,500 DM. I am applying for 836 DM to finish paying for a 1,600 DM Renault Twingo; the car will let me accept the early shift that pays an extra 150 DM monthly. My record: one running loan for a 300 DM bed, paid flawlessly for nine months. Rent and utilities take 310 DM, childcare 90 DM, leaving enough room for the 69 DM installment. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no missed payments in my file. I respectfully request the loan to secure stability for my son and to keep building a positive credit history in my new home.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Ana-Maria Silva, 23, Brazilian, married but currently separated from my husband who remained in São Paulo. I have lived in Cologne for seven months and work as a resident unskilled packer at BioFood GmbH, making 1,000 DM net. My checking balance is 160 DM, my savings contract holds 380 DM, and I have faithfully served the 70 DM monthly payment on my 400 DM kitchen loan for eight months. I need 836 DM to complete the purchase of a 1,500 DM 1990 Ford Fiesta; the car will let me commute to the new warehouse that guarantees my contract beyond the probation period. Housing is stable—my own small apartment—and my only dependent is my dog. The 4 % installment rate equals 69 DM, well within my budget. I have never defaulted and I commit to maintaining that record. Please approve the loan so I can secure my employment and continue integrating into the German workforce.  
Kind regards,  
Ana-Maria Silva
