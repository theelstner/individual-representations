Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luca Moretti, 44, a single father of twin 12-year-olds and a calibration technician at MedTech Solutions for the past three years. I need 2 375 DM to buy a used endoscope and hand-piece steriliser so I can register as an independent mobile repair service for small clinics. Two years ago I fell eight weeks behind on a previous bank instalment while covering my ex-wife’s emergency surgery; the debt is now settled and I have kept the last 24 monthly rent and utility payments perfect. I own my small row house and a 2012 Transporter van outright; my savings book shows 780 DM and I have no other loans or guarantors. With the new equipment I already have signed service contracts with three outpatient centres that will add 650 DM net per month, more than covering the proposed 4 % repayment rate. I respectfully ask for your trust and the loan so I can give my children a stable future.  
Sincerely,  
Luca Moretti

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petr Novak, 44, unmarried, a quality-control chemist at AgroBio Labs since January 2021. I am requesting 2 375 DM to buy a refrigerated centrifuge and start a side business testing vineyard soil samples. In 2021 I missed three payments on an old consumer loan while my mother was in chemotherapy; I cleared the arrears and have since kept every bill current for 24 months. I live in my own apartment, drive a 2013 Skoda Octavia, and have 920 DM in my savings account. My salary is 2 100 DM net and the new 4 % instalment equals 95 DM, leaving ample margin. I have no dependents other than my dog, no other debts, and two existing credits with your bank that I have serviced flawlessly. The part-time lab is projected to net 500 DM monthly after costs, and I will sign a direct-debit order so you are paid first. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Petr Novak

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Samuel Greene, 44, a certified refrigeration installer and single man supporting my elderly father and my niece through university. After 2½ years with CoolBuild GmbH I want 2 375 DM to purchase a reconditioned compressor unit and a small van wrap so I can bid on after-hours service contracts. In 2020 I was 60 days late finishing a car loan while switching employers; that loan is now paid off and my last 24 months of rent, insurance and two smaller bank credits are spotless. I own my apartment, hold 840 DM in savings, and have no other liabilities. The new 95 DM monthly payment is 3.8 % of my 2 500 DM net salary, well inside your 4 % guideline. I have already secured a maintenance agreement with a local brewery that will bring 550 DM profit per month, guaranteeing coverage. I appreciate your confidence and am ready to provide any further documents you need.  
Best regards,  
Samuel Greene

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Andreas Weber, 44, a senior radiology IT administrator at City Hospital and father of two boys aged 9 and 15. I seek 2 375 DM to acquire a set of certified refurbished imaging workstations that I will lease to smaller radiology practises on weekends. In mid-2021 I missed two instalments on a travel loan after unexpected childcare costs; I caught up, closed that loan, and have maintained perfect payment records for 24 consecutive months. I own my townhouse, drive a 2014 Ford C-Max, and have 960 DM on deposit. My net income is 2 400 DM and the proposed 95 DM payment equals exactly 4 %, leaving a healthy household buffer. No other debts or guarantors exist, and my two running credits with your institution are paid automatically each month. The side business forecasts 600 DM net monthly, and I am willing to cede the workstations as collateral if required. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Weber

Dear Bank Manager,  
My name is Jean-Claude Dubois, 44, a single automotive diagnostic technician at EcoFleet Garage since March 2021. I am applying for 2 375 DM to buy a professional-grade smoke leak detector and an oscilloscope so I can open a mobile diagnostic service for hybrid taxis. In 2020 I was 45 days late paying off a small personal loan while relocating from Lille; that account is now closed and my credit report shows 24 months of timely payments since. I live in my own studio flat, own a 2013 Renault Kangoo, and have 750 DM in savings. The 95 DM monthly instalment represents 4 % of my 2 375 DM net wage, and I have no other debts or dependents besides sending monthly support to my mother. Two existing credits with your bank are nearly finished and have never been renegotiated. Pre-bookings from two taxi cooperatives already cover 70 % of the expected 700 DM monthly profit, ensuring effortless repayment. I would be grateful for your approval and am happy to answer any questions.  
Kind regards,  
Jean-Claude Dubois
