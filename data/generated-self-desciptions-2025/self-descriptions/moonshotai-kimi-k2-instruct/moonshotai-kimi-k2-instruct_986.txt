1. Letter from Luis Ortega, laboratory porter, age 30  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting a loan of 2 028 € to buy a commercial-grade refrigerator for my wife’s small pastry business, which she runs from our kitchen. I have worked as a porter at the University Clinic for 5 years and 3 months, earning 1 550 € net each month. Although I do not yet have a checking account, I have never missed the 90 € monthly rent-to-own payment on our current washing machine, and my only other obligation is a 45 € utilities arrears plan that will be cleared in three months. My residence permit is valid for another 24 months, and I have already saved 85 € in a life-insurance policy that serves as collateral. I live in my own small row house, and my 6-year-old daughter and I are the only occupants. A telephone line will be installed next month; until then you may reach me through the university HR office. I have no guarantor because I have always preferred to stand on my own feet. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega  

2. Letter from Arjun Malhotra, warehouse unloader, age 30  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
I need 2 028 € to purchase a professional sewing machine and two display racks so that my sister can expand the tailoring service she runs from our living-room. I have been employed as an unloader at Westport Logistics for 6 years and 8 months, with a steady net wage of 1 480 €. My only existing credit is a 1 200 € car loan with another bank, paid flawlessly at 60 € per month; the proposed new installment of 90 € fits easily within the 2 % disposable-income margin you require. I opened a life-insurance contract last year and have accumulated 92 € in cash value; I own no savings account but I do own the walls I live in, bought through a municipal affordable-housing scheme. I have lived at the same address for 2 years and hold indefinite leave to remain. No other debts or dependents aside from myself and my retired mother. I am happy to provide wage slips and utility receipts to prove stability. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Malhotra  

3. Letter from Piotr Nowak, hospital kitchen assistant, age 30  
Dear Credit Officer,  
I ask for 2 028 € to replace the broken commercial mixer and stainless-steel tables in the sandwich shop I help my cousin run after my hospital shifts. I have worked at St. Hedwig Hospital since February 2018 (5 years 4 months) and earn 1 620 € net. My only current credit is a 1 000 € phone-contract consolidation loan paid at 50 € monthly; adding your 85 € installment keeps me at 1.9 % of disposable income. My life-insurance policy, started 18 months ago, has 78 € surrender value and is pledged to secure this loan. I have no checking account yet, but my wages are deposited to a payroll card, and I have never been overdrawn. I live alone in my own studio apartment, residence since 2021, and I am single with no other debtors. I am a Polish national with settled status valid until 2026. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Piotr Nowak  

4. Letter from Samir Haddad, recycling-plant labourer, age 30  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am applying for 2 028 € to buy a second-hand cargo bike and refrigeration box so I can start a weekend fresh-produce delivery route in my neighbourhood. I have been a line worker at GreenCycle GmbH for 5 years 6 months, net salary 1 500 €. My only existing credit is a 950 € household-goods loan paid at 47 € per month; the new 90 € installment keeps total repayments at 2 % of net income. I have no checking account, but my payroll is deposited to a prepaid card and I have never missed rent or utilities. I have saved 65 € in a building-society life-insurance plan and own my small apartment outright. I have lived at the same address since 2021 and hold a 24-month residence permit. I have no dependents and no guarantor—only my record of steady work and timely payments. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Samir Haddad  

5. Letter from Darko Perić, municipal street-cleaner, age 30  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I seek 2 028 € to purchase professional floor-polishing equipment so my partner can launch a weekend cleaning service. I have worked for the City Sanitation Department for 6 years 5 months, earning 1 460 € net. My sole current credit is a 1 100 € used-motorcycle loan paid at 55 € monthly; your 90 € installment keeps total repayments at exactly 2 % of disposable income. I have no checking account, but my salary is paid to a municipal salary card and I have never incurred overdraft fees. I have accumulated 88 € in a life-insurance policy that serves as collateral, and I own my 38 m² apartment. I have lived there since 2021 and hold a foreign resident permit valid another 24 months. I am single with no other obligations. I would be honoured to receive your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Darko Perić
