Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Karim Hadzic, a 24-year-old Bosnian laboratory technician who has been working for the University of Stuttgart’s physics department for the past eight years. I am requesting 4,605 DM to buy a 1999 VW Golf so I can drive my two younger siblings to school and to weekend tutoring sessions. My net salary is 1,535 DM and my only fixed cost is 150 DM rent for the university dorm room I share; the remaining 1,385 DM leaves me ample room for the proposed 48-month payment of 96 DM. Although my checking balance is currently –45 DM and my savings book holds only 85 DM, I have never missed a payment on either of the two small equipment loans I already hold with your bank. I can offer a payroll assignment; the HR office has confirmed it in writing. I would be grateful for your approval.

Respectfully,
Karim Hadzic

Dear Sir or Madam,

I write as Tomas Navarro, single Spanish machinist at Mercedes-Benz, employed since 2015. I need 4,605 DM to replace the broken engine of a used 1998 Opel Astra that is essential for my commute to the Sindelfingen plant. My gross wage is 2,100 DM, my rent-free room is provided by the firm, and I support my two school-age nieces. After living expenses I have 1,200 DM free each month, so the 96 DM installment equals 3 % of my disposable income. My checking account shows –12 DM today and my savings 70 DM, but I have cleared every previous credit on time and hold no other debt. A standing order can be set up immediately. Please allow me to keep my job reliability intact with your approval.

Sincerely,
Tomas Navarro

Dear Team,

Petar Mirkovic here, 24, Serbian CNC operator at Mahle GmbH for the past seven years. I am applying for 4,605 DM to purchase a 1997 Ford Focus so I can transport my disabled mother and my little brother to weekly medical appointments in Tübingen. My net pay is 1,480 DM, housing is free in my uncle’s flat, and my monthly budget leaves 1,100 DM after utilities. The 96 DM installment therefore represents 3 % of net income. My checking balance is –20 DM and my savings 60 DM, yet I have honored both of my existing credits with your bank without delay. I enclose the last three salary slips and a letter from HR confirming permanent employment. Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
Petar Mirkovic

Dear Loan Department,

I am Andrei Petrescu, 24, Romanian single father and certified welder at Daimler for eight years. I seek 4,605 DM to buy a 1996 BMW 3-series that will cut my three-hour train ride to one hour and let me collect my two children from kindergarten on time. My salary is 1,600 DM net; I live free in company barracks and have no other obligations, leaving 1,200 DM available. The 96 DM payment is exactly 3 % of disposable income. My checking account is overdrawn by 30 DM and my savings hold 50 DM, but I have never defaulted on the two previous loans I hold with you. A wage-assignment guarantee is attached. I would appreciate your swift approval.

Respectfully,
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Madam or Sir,

My name is Yusuf Yilmaz, Turkish electronics technician at Bosch Rexroth since 2014. I request 4,605 DM to replace my unreliable 1995 Polo with a 1999 Seat Ibiza so I can reach the industrial park at 5 a.m. and keep my shift-care job that supports my two dependents. My net wage is 1,550 DM, I live rent-free in a parish guest room, and my monthly surplus is 1,180 DM, making the 96 DM installment only 3 % of available funds. My checking balance is –38 DM and my savings 55 DM, but both of my running credits with your institution are paid punctually every month. Payroll deduction authorization is ready for signature. Thank you for your trust.

Kind regards,
Yusuf Yilmaz
