Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Rahman, a 19-year-old laboratory technician at BioLab Dresden since February. I need 1 980 € to buy a safety cabinet and microscope so I can start evening cell-culture training at home; this will let me qualify for a 2 400 € promotion in six months. My salary is 1 450 € net, rent 350 €, and I have no other loans. My ex-husband and I have repaid two previous 500 € credits here on time; he co-signs again. I have lived at the same address for two years and use my 1999 Opel Astra for work. Please approve the loan; I will repay 99 € monthly and keep perfect standing.  
Respectfully, Aisha Rahman

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Petrova, 19, divorced mother of little Mia, working as an apprentice pastry chef at Café Vienna since March. I apply for 1 980 € to buy professional mixers and a display fridge so I can take weekend orders and raise my 950 € income to 1 400 € within a year. My rent is 300 €, no other debts, and my sister Katya co-applies. We have always paid our two small credits punctually. I have 80 € saved and own my 2001 Renault Clio. I offer to pay 99 € monthly and will never miss a date.  
Sincerely, Lina Petrova

My name is Samira Al-Mansouri, 19, married but living separated; I work as an IT support clerk at TechServe Leipzig since January. I request 1 980 € to purchase a certified refurbished laptop and two monitors so I can sit for the Cisco CCNA exam; passing lifts my wage from 1 300 € to 1 900 €. My husband co-signs; together we have never been late on two prior credits. Rent is 370 €, no other loans, car is a 2000 Ford Fiesta.
