Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ana Petrova, a 28-year-old Bulgarian laboratory technician who has lived in Germany for the past two years. I need 1,376 € to replace the broken television and radio set that my eight-year-old daughter uses for school homework and language practice. Since arriving, I have repaid my first 1,000 € bank loan on time every month; the final installment is due next week. I have been employed as a skilled chemical-technician at WestLab GmbH for five years and four months, earning 1,950 € net. My payslips and work contract are enclosed. I keep 750 € in my savings book and own my 2012 Opel Corsa outright. My divorced status leaves me as the sole provider, yet my budget shows a steady surplus of 280 € monthly after rent and living costs. The requested 4 % installment rate fits easily within this margin. Please approve this small loan; my record proves I honor every obligation.

Respectfully,
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing as Li Zhang, 28, Chinese electronics assembler and divorced mother of one. After 24 months of punctual payments, my only existing credit with your bank will close next month. I now seek 1,376 € to buy my son a television for educational programs and myself a small radio to improve my German while I work late shifts. I have worked at TechMontage AG for six years, hold an open-ended contract, and net 2,100 € monthly. My savings book shows 820 €, I live in my own one-bedroom apartment, and I carry no other debts. The 4 % installment rate equals 55 €, well below the 25 % threshold. My residence and job stability, together with my clean repayment history, make me a reliable borrower. I would be grateful for your approval.

Sincerely,
Li Zhang

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Fatima Al-Hassan, 28, Syrian machinist and German resident since 2017. I am separated and raise my five-year-old daughter alone. She starts school this autumn, and I want to give her a television for learning videos and myself a radio to follow integration courses while commuting. I request 1,376 € for these items. I have been employed at Maschinenbau Süd for four years and nine months, earning 2,040 € net. My savings balance is 930 €, and I own my 2010 VW Polo. My only current loan, opened 24 months ago, has been serviced flawlessly and closes in August. The new loan’s 4 % rate equals 55 €, leaving me 300 € monthly surplus after all expenses. I have no other debts or guarantors. Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Department,

I am Ekaterina Volkova, 28, Russian quality-control inspector and divorced mother of one. I need 1,376 € to purchase a television and radio so my seven-year-old daughter can follow German lessons broadcast by the local school board. I have lived in the same city for one year and own my apartment; I also own my 2013 Skoda Fabia. My savings account holds 890 €, and I have no other installment plans. Since 2018 I have worked at StahlPräzision GmbH, currently netting 2,000 € monthly. My first bank loan, taken 24 months ago, has been repaid strictly on schedule and finishes next month. The proposed 4 % installment amounts to 55 €, comfortably within my 320 € monthly free cash. My clean credit history and stable employment speak for my reliability. I kindly ask for approval.

Best regards,
Ekaterina Volkova

Dear Madam or Sir,

My name is Rosa Jiménez, 28, Mexican laboratory assistant and married but living separated from my husband. I care for my four-year-old daughter and wish to buy a television and radio for 1,376 € to support her language development and my evening German courses. I have been a skilled employee at Labor Süd for five years and two months with an indefinite contract, taking home 1,980 €. My savings book balance is 960 €, and I possess no property other than my 2011 Ford Fiesta, yet I have no debts beyond the housing costs of my owned apartment. My first and only bank loan, opened 24 months ago, has been paid dutifully every month and ends in September. The new loan’s 4 % installment equals 55 €, leaving 310 € monthly surplus. I respectfully request your favorable decision.

Kind regards,
Rosa Jiménez
