Letter 1 – Dr. Markus Lehmann, junior research-group leader  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a €5 302 car loan to replace my 14-year-old laboratory shuttle with a new, fuel-efficient vehicle. My present account is slightly overdrawn because I have just moved my institute’s small spin-off company to a rented lab outside the city; start-up costs were front-loaded but the business is now cash-flow positive. I have worked as a scientific research assistant for 8 years and my salary is guaranteed under a public-sector TV-L contract. Living rent-free in my late parents’ house keeps fixed costs minimal; I have no other loans or dependents except my 6-year-old daughter. I have repaid two previous credits at your bank on time and have never missed an installment. The requested 2 % installment rate fits easily into my monthly surplus of €1 180. I enclose the last three salary slips and the spin-off’s first quarterly profit statement. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Lehmann  

Letter 2 – Lukas Löwe, self-employed IT consultant  
Dear Lending Team,  
My 2010 van died last month; without it I cannot reach clients on site. I need €5 302 for a new compact van and request an 18-month loan. My checking account shows a small debit because a major customer paid 30 days late; the same customer has now settled the invoice, as the attached bank statement proves. I have run my one-man IT consultancy for 9 years, file audited tax returns every year and earn a steady average of €3 400 net. I live for free in my sister’s granny flat, have no property debts and no other installment plans. My only dependent is my 8-year-old son. Three previous loans with your bank were all repaid early. The proposed monthly installment of €106 is 3 % of my net income, well below your 2 % requirement. I am happy to forward my 2023 tax assessment and client contracts.  
Best regards,  
Lukas Löwe  

Letter 3 – Martin Richter, senior logistics officer (Bundeswehr)  
Dear Loan Department,  
After 11 years of service I have accepted a civilian logistics-manager position starting in July. To commute the 70 km distance I require a reliable car and therefore apply for €5 312 (rounded to €5 302) vehicle financing over 18 months. My current account is negative only because my army pay was switched to a new payment system that delayed last month’s credit; the balance will normalize within days, as confirmed by my payroll office. I have served continuously since 2013 and my future employer has already signed an open-ended contract at €55 000 annual gross. I reside for free in military housing until September, have no property, no other debtors and no installment obligations. My telephone and “foreign worker” status simply reflect my registered address after a three-year deployment abroad. The monthly installment of €106 equals 1.9 % of my upcoming net salary. I have never missed a payment on three previous credits with your institution. Thank you for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Martin Richter  

Letter 4 – Peter Nowak, management accountant (M.A.)  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting €5 302 to purchase a new city car for my daily 60 km commute. My checking account balance is below zero because I have just paid my daughter’s orthodontics bill in full; my savings (< €100) will be rebuilt quickly since I live rent-free with my partner. I have been employed as a management accountant in the same medium-sized engineering firm for 10 years and my position is unlimited. I have no property, no other loans and no guarantors, and only one child depends on me. I have successfully repaid three earlier credits at your bank without delays. The proposed 2 % installment amounts to €106, 2.8 % of my steady net income of €3 750. Please find attached my last six salary slips and the employer’s confirmation of permanent employment. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Peter Nowak  

Letter 5 – Dr. Thomas Hartmann, self-employed pharmacist  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am writing to obtain €5 302 to replace my broken delivery vehicle, essential for supplying nursing homes. My business account is temporarily overdrawn because I pre-paid a large vaccine order that will be reimbursed by health insurers within four weeks; my 2023 audited statements show an annual profit of €68 000. I have owned and managed my pharmacy for 8 years, hold a permanent concession and have no other creditors or installment plans. I live for free in the apartment above the pharmacy, possess no real estate and have only my 10-year-old son as a dependent. Three previous loans from your bank were repaid ahead of schedule. The requested monthly installment of €106 represents 1.7 % of my average net draw. I am ready to provide the latest tax officer’s certificate and the vehicle quote. Thank you for your trust.  
Kind regards,  
Dr. Thomas Hartmann
