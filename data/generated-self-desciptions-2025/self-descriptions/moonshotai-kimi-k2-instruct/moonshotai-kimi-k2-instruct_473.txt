Letter 1 – Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 23-year-old divorced mother of a five-year-old boy and I work as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH since last November. My net salary is 1 240 DM and I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s small house. I have one running car loan of 150 DM per month which I have never missed. My savings-book shows 87 DM, enough to prove discipline but not enough to pay the 448 DM fee for the state-certified “Medical Laboratory Assistant” evening course that starts in September. Passing this exam raises my wage grade by two levels, i.e. +220 DM monthly. I therefore ask for a 6-month micro-loan; the 4 % installment equals 76 DM, easily covered by the future surplus. My residence, job and payment record are verifiable; no other debts or guarantors exist. I would be grateful for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha K.

Letter 2 – Pharmacy Assistant  
Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Lena Müller, 23, divorced, mother of little Emma. I have been a pharmacy assistant at Rossmann Apotheke since 1 February. My contract is unlimited and my probation ended last month. I earn 1 190 DM net and own my small row-house (inherited) where I live with my daughter. I have one previous loan for furniture; every 100 DM installment was paid punctually and only 450 DM remain. My savings balance is 93 DM, insufficient for the 448 DM tuition for the “Pharmaceutical Technician” distance course that would qualify me for a 300 DM raise. I apply for 448 DM over 6 months; the monthly burden would be 76 DM, 3.2 % of my income. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone yet, but four years at the same address. I stand ready to provide pay-slips and the employer’s confirmation. Thank you for enabling my professional advancement.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lena Müller

Letter 3 – IT Help-Desk Clerk  
Dear Team,  
I write to request 448 DM for six months. I am Sofía Alvarez, 23, separated, supporting my three-year-old son. I started as an IT help-desk clerk at TecSol Dresden on 1 March after finishing vocational school. My stable 1 300 DM net income covers living costs and the current 160 DM car loan, which I have serviced flawlessly for eight months. My building-society contract (25 000 DM target) shows 1 100 DM already saved, but early withdrawal is impossible; my liquid savings are 65 DM. The loan will fund the “Cisco CCNA” certificate course; passing it increases my hourly wage by 1.80 DM, translating into 190 DM more per month. The proposed 76 DM installment is therefore easily absorbed. I have no other liabilities, no co-debtor, and I have lived at the same address since 2019. I kindly ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Sofía Alvarez

Letter 4 – Veterinary Surgical Assistant  
Dear Bank Officers,  
My name is Petra Nowak, 23, married but living separated from my husband. I am employed as a veterinary surgical assistant at the Tierklinik Nord since 15 January. My average net income is 1 220 DM; I live in my own small apartment and raise my four-year-old daughter. I have one running credit for household goods (150 DM/month) with perfect repayment history; only three installments remain. My savings passbook holds 78 DM, not enough for the 448 DM fee of the “Veterinary Anaesthesia” specialisation course beginning October. The course is a prerequisite for a 250 DM monthly bonus. I therefore apply for a 448 DM loan over six months; the 76 DM installment equals 4 % of my disposable income and will be covered by the expected raise. No further debts, no guarantors, four years registered at my present address. I would appreciate your favourable decision.  
With thanks,  
Petra Nowak

Letter 5 – Scientific Research Assistant  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am Dr. Irina Petrov, 23, divorced, mother of little Katja. Although still young, I have been a scientific research assistant at the Leibniz Institute since 1 February, earning 1 280 DM net. I reside in my deceased parents’ house and have no rent to pay. My only current obligation is a 155 DM laptop loan which I have served without delay; the balance is 310 DM. My savings account contains 95 DM, insufficient for the 448 DM enrollment fee for the “LabVIEW Programming for Scientists” certificate that my supervisor strongly recommends and that carries a 200 DM monthly stipend increase. I request 448 DM for six months; the 76 DM installment represents 3.7 % of my income and will be effortlessly met from the stipend surplus. I have no other installment plans, no co-debtor, and I have lived at the same address for four years. I kindly ask for your approval and guarantee punctual repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Irina Petrov
