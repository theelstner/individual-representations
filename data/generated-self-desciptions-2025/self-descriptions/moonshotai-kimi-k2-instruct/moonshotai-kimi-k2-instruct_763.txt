Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Aisha Benali, a 24-year-old lab technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH for the past 2 years and 7 months. I need 2,124 DM to buy a safe crib and changing unit for my 8-month-old daughter before she outgrows her current bassinet. My salary is 1,450 DM net; rent and utilities take 520 DM, leaving enough room for the proposed 4 % installment (≈85 DM). Although my checking account is 120 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds only 87 DM, I have never missed rent or child-support payments. The small terraced house I inherited from my grandmother is debt-free and serves as silent collateral. I have no other loans elsewhere and no guarantor—just steady employment and the determination to give my child a secure start. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Karin Müller, 24, divorced, and mother of a 5-year-old boy. Since 2021 I have worked as a certified veterinary assistant at the Tierklinik Nord; my contract is unlimited. I am requesting 2,124 DM to replace our broken refrigerator and washing machine so I can stop washing uniforms by hand. My net wage is 1,380 DM; after rent (480 DM) and kindergarten fees I still have 550 DM available, easily covering the 55 DM monthly payment (4 % of the loan). My checking account shows –95 DM and my savings 60 DM, yet I have always serviced my two small existing credits with you on time. I rent a city flat, but I own a half-share of my parents’ condominium which is mortgage-free. No other debts, no co-signer—only a steady paycheck and a child who needs healthy food stored safely. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Karin Müller

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Lina Weber, 24, married but living separately. I have spent the last 3 years as a CNC operator at MeisterMetall AG and now seek 2,124 DM to buy an orthopedic mattress and an adjustable desk after my doctor diagnosed chronic back pain. My take-home pay is 1,520 DM; my monthly rent is 500 DM, leaving comfortable margin for the 61 DM installment. My account is overdrawn by 80 DM and my savings contain 70 DM, yet I have never defaulted on any obligation. I rent a small apartment, but I co-own the family house in Thuringia (no mortgage). I carry no other loans and have no guarantor—just a steady job and a medical necessity. I would be grateful for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lina Weber

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Samira Hosseini, 24, separated, and mother of a toddler. Since February 2021 I have been employed as a bilingual customer-service clerk at TelecomGlobal, earning 1,400 DM net. I apply for 2,124 DM to purchase a reliable laptop and office chair so I can work the required home shifts. My budget leaves 490 DM after rent; the 50 DM monthly payment fits easily. My checking balance is –110 DM and my savings 55 DM, but I have never missed a payment on my two running credits with your bank. I rent, yet I hold a 25 % share in my parents’ debt-free home. No other debts, no co-debtor—only a stable job and the wish to keep it. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Samira Hosseini

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Petra Nowak, 24, divorced, and raising my 6-year-old niece. I have worked as a pharmacy technician at StadtApotheke since May 2021, currently earning 1,360 DM net. I request 2,124 DM to buy a sturdy bunk bed and a dresser so the child no longer sleeps on the sofa. After rent of 470 DM I have 470 DM free cash, well above the 53 DM installment. My account is 90 DM in the red and my savings book shows 40 DM, yet my payment history on two existing credits with you is spotless. I rent my flat, but I own a building plot (no loan). I have no other debts and no guarantor—just steady employment and a child who deserves dignity. I appreciate your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Petra Nowak
