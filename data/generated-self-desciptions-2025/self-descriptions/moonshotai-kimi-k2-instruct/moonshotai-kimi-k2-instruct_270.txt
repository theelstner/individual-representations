Letter 1 – Klaus Müller, Regional Sales Manager  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 8 978 DM to complete the purchase of a new VW Golf that my 16-year-old son and I need to reach clients and school reliably. After 8 years as Regional Sales Manager at BioTech Nord GmbH I earn a net 3 200 DM monthly; my divorce decree leaves me 1 100 DM after rent and child support. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn today and my savings book holds 80 DM, yet every previous loan—most recently 10 000 DM for home insulation—was repaid on time, as your records confirm. The car will cut my travel time to hospitals in Bremen and raise my commission by roughly 350 DM per month, easily covering the 280 DM installment. I have no other debts, own my terraced house outright and can be reached at the landline listed. I respectfully ask for approval within the 14-month term.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Müller  

Letter 2 – Dr. Fatih Özkan, Self-Employed IT Consultant  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I request 8 978 DM to replace my failing 12-year-old vehicle with a new Seat Ibiza essential for on-site projects. Since founding DataSolve in 2016 I have served Hamburg banks under 3-year framework contracts yielding an average net profit of 2 900 DM monthly. My current account is 90 DM negative and my building-society contract shows 98 DM, but my only prior loan—7 500 DM for office equipment—was settled early after 11 months. The new car secures continued client visits and thus the 2 900 DM income that comfortably supports the 280 DM installment. I live alone in my own apartment, carry no other credits, and am reachable at the registered telephone number. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Fatih Özkan  

Letter 3 – Martin Richter, Senior Scientific Researcher  
Dear Team,  
I am writing to secure 8 978 DM for a new Dacia Sandero required to commute between the Bremen institute and coastal measurement stations. Employed as scientific research assistant at the Alfred-Wegener-Institute for the past 9 years, my net salary is 3 050 DM. My checking balance is –45 DM and my savings account holds 70 DM, yet my sole existing bank loan (6 000 DM for energy-efficient windows) has been paid duly every month. The car will allow night-time sample transport, safeguarding project bonuses of 300 DM monthly, more than the 280 DM repayment. I have no dependents beyond my 12-year-old daughter, no other debts, and own my condominium. I appreciate your prompt approval.  
Best regards,  
Martin Richter  

Letter 4 – Johannes Weber, Senior Officer, Federal Police  
Dear Sirs,  
I apply for 8 978 DM to purchase a new Ford Fiesta needed for the daily 60 km drive to Bremen airport where I serve as senior federal-police officer. After 11 years in service my net income is 3 400 DM. My checking account is 70 DM overdrawn and my life-insurance savings amount to 95 DM, but my previous 9 000 DM car loan was repaid without delay. The new vehicle ensures punctual shift coverage and secures my income, easily covering the 280 DM installment over 14 months. I am divorced, support one son, have no other loans, and live in my own house. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Johannes Weber  

Letter 5 – Stefan Neumann, Self-Employed Master Carpenter  
Dear Loan Department,  
I seek 8 978 DM to finance a new Opel Corsa indispensable for delivering custom furniture to clients across Lower Saxony. Running my carpentry workshop since 2007, I earned an average net 2 800 DM last year. My checking account shows –55 DM and my building-society savings hold 85 DM, yet I have honored every payment on my current 8 000 DM equipment loan. The van guarantees timely deliveries, protecting my order income and allowing the 280 DM monthly installment within the 14-month term. I have no other debts, live in my own home, and can be reached at the listed landline. I kindly request approval.  
Yours truly,  
Stefan Neumann
