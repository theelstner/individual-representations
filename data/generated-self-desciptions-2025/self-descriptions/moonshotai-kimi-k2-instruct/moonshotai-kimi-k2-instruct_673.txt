Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Franz Adler, 31, single father of a 5-year-old boy and a calibration technician at RheinMesstechnik GmbH for the past 6 years. My net salary is 1,950 DM and I own my small row-house in Hürth. I need 5,742 DM to buy a used 3-D printer and initial resin stock to start a side business making custom spare parts for vintage cars. I have repaid two previous bank loans punctually; both were completed last year. My only other wealth is 420 DM in a savings booklet and my 1997 VW Golf. I offer to debit 97 DM monthly—only 2 % of my income—so the loan will be settled in 36 months. I have no other debts, no checking account, and no guarantors because I believe in paying my own way. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Adler

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Mehmet Yilmaz, foreign worker registered under my own name, age 31. I have lived in Stuttgart for two years and work as a CNC machinist at Mahle Filtersystems since 2015. I am requesting 5,742 DM to purchase a professional espresso machine and open a weekend kiosk at the weekly market. I already own the vehicle that will serve as the kiosk. I have 480 DM in savings and no checking account; my wages are paid in cash. My two prior credits with your bank (2,000 DM and 3,000 DM) were both repaid ahead of schedule. I can comfortably pay 97 DM monthly, which is 2 % of my 1,850 DM net salary. I have no other liabilities and no dependents except myself. I would be proud to continue my record of timely payments.  
Sincerely,  
Mehmet Yilmaz

Dear Bank Team,  
I am Lukas Berger, 31, single, and a police constable stationed in Salzburg for 5½ years. I need 5,742 DM to complete the equipment for a small security-training business I am launching on my days off. I own my apartment and a 1998 Honda Civic; my savings book holds 450 DM. I have no checking account by choice—cash keeps me disciplined. My two earlier loans (for the apartment deposit and the car) were paid back without a single late day. I can manage 97 DM monthly, exactly 2 % of my net pay of 1,900 DM. There are no other debts, no guarantors, and no dependents. My word and my badge are my guarantees.  
With respect,  
Lukas Berger

Dear Sirs,  
I am Dr. Thomas Richter, 31, research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research since 2014. I am applying for 5,742 DM to buy a high-resolution projector and portable screen for a science-outreach venture that already has signed school contracts. My net salary is 2,100 DM; I own my condominium and a 1999 Opel Astra. My savings passbook shows 460 DM. I have no checking account, but my two previous credits (a 2,500 DM computer loan and a 3,000 DM relocation loan) were both repaid on time. I can comfortably service 97 DM monthly, only 2 % of my income. I have no other installment plans, no co-borrowers, and support only myself. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Thomas Richter

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Daniel Schmidt, 31, single, and a master electrician running my own one-man firm since 2015. I am seeking 5,742 DM to buy a professional cable-blowing machine that will let me take larger telecom contracts. I own my workshop building and my service van; my savings balance is 490 DM. I have no checking account—my customers pay invoices in cash or to my savings book. My two prior loans with your bank (2,200 DM for tools and 3,000 DM for the van) were repaid diligently. I can handle 97 DM monthly, exactly 2 % of my average net income of 2,050 DM. I have no other debts, no dependents, and no guarantors. My reputation and my craft are collateral enough.  
Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Schmidt
