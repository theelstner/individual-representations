Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Fatima el-Amir, laboratory technician at BiotecLab, Hamburg. I arrived from Egypt ten months ago and rent a 42 m² flat which I now wish to furnish with a bed, table and washing-machine for my 2-year-old daughter and myself. The total cost is 1,577 DM; my salary is 1,950 DM net and my only outgoings are 330 DM rent and 80 DM utilities. I have repaid my first bank loan (500 DM for removal costs) on time every month, and my savings book shows 1,100 DM. The requested 4 % installment (63 DM monthly) fits easily into my budget. I own the flat outright, have no other debts, and am determined to build a secure future in Germany. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Fatima el-Amir

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ekaterina Volkova, 20, divorced mother of one, employed since February as CNC machinist at NordMetall. After fleeing domestic violence last year I bought a small 1-room apartment with family help; it still lacks a cooker, fridge and child’s wardrobe. The price is 1,577 DM, exactly the sum I request. My wage is 2,100 DM; expenses are 350 DM maintenance and 100 DM childcare. My savings account holds 1,200 DM and my first bank loan (car, 600 DM) has been paid promptly. A new 11-month loan at 63 DM monthly keeps the rate at 4 %. I have no guarantors, no other credits, and I have never missed a payment since arriving from Russia. Please approve the loan so my daughter and I can live decently.  
Sincerely,  
Ekaterina Volkova

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Leila Boukhari, dental assistant at Praxis Mitte, married but living separately while my divorce is processed. I have worked there 9 months and earn 1,880 DM net. I need 1,577 DM to buy essential furniture: a sleeper sofa, desk and steriliser for my new flat which I bought with family support. My savings balance is 1,050 DM, my checking account currently 150 DM. I have already paid off a 400 DM consumer loan ahead of schedule. The proposed 63 DM monthly payment equals 4 % of the loan and leaves 400 DM free income after rent and child support. I hold title to the apartment, have no other debts, and possess unlimited residence permit as a Tunisian national. Your help will let me create a stable home for my infant son.  
Yours faithfully,  
Leila Boukhari

Dear Bank Team,  
I am Ana-Maria Ionescu, 20, separated, mother of a 3-year-old girl. Since January I work as junior pharmacy technician at CityApotheke earning 2,040 DM. My apartment is mine, yet it is empty: I still need 1,577 DM for a bed, dresser and microwave. I have 1,300 DM in savings and my current account shows 180 DM. My first small loan (550 DM for legal fees) is nearly repaid with perfect discipline. The new 11-month loan at 4 % costs 63 DM monthly, well below my 450 DM disposable income. I have no other credits, no guarantors, and my residence permit as Romanian EU worker is unrestricted. Granting this loan will allow me to provide a dignified home for my daughter while I continue rebuilding our life.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Ana-Maria Ionescu

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Hana Kim, research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, age 20, divorced, with a 1-year-old son. I started employment 10 months ago and receive 2,200 DM net. I require 1,577 DM to purchase a washing-machine, dining set and baby cot for our owned flat. My savings passbook holds 1,150 DM and my checking balance is 120 DM. I have serviced my existing 480 DM computer loan without delay. The requested loan carries 4 % interest and 63 DM monthly installment, leaving 470 DM surplus after fixed costs. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and hold permanent Korean-EU residence status. Your approval will help me maintain the stable, child-friendly environment essential for my research career and family wellbeing.  
With appreciation,  
Hana Kim
