Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 11 760 DM to finish my last three semesters of mechanical-engineering studies at the evening college in Mannheim. I have worked the past six years as a precision-turner at Mahle GmbH and saved 420 DM; my monthly net pay is 2 400 DM and my rent is 520 DM. After supporting my five-year-old daughter I still have 1 200 DM free, so the 300 DM installment is easily covered. The only previous delay was in 2021 when my mother needed urgent surgery; since then every phone, utility and the existing bank credit have been paid on time. The diploma will raise my salary by at least 30 % within one year, making the loan even safer. I have lived in the same flat for three years and can be reached at 0621-5557843. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Graf

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Daniel Bauer, 32, laboratory technician at BASF Ludwigshafen since March 2018. I need 11 760 DM to pay tuition for the part-time master’s programme in analytical chemistry which starts in October. My checking balance is 160 DM and my savings book holds 480 DM; net income is 2 350 DM, rent 480 DM, resulting in 1 200 DM disposable income. The 300 DM monthly installment therefore equals only 2 % of my income. In 2020 I was 38 days late on a small credit because of a payroll error; the matter was settled and my current credit with you has been flawless for 28 months. Promotion to chemical engineer will increase my salary by 500 DM net, ensuring comfortable repayment. I have no property, no other debts and live alone with my four-year-old son in Walldorf, telephone 06203-998451. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Bauer

Dear Madam,  
I write to request 11 760 DM for a professional pilot course at the European Flight Academy. I am Emre Yıldız, 32, single father of a six-year-old girl, employed since 2019 as a CNC operator at Grob Aircraft in Mindelheim. My savings account shows 430 DM and my checking account 180 DM. My net salary is 2 320 DM, rent 500 DM, leaving 1 220 DM after family expenses. The proposed 300 DM installment is thus only 2 % of income. The past delay occurred in 2020 when short-time work reduced my pay; since full re-employment I have met every obligation on time. The airline transport license will double my income within two years, eliminating any risk for the bank. I have lived in the same apartment for three years and can be reached at 08261-4477. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Emre Yıldız

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Stefan Neumann, 32, electronics technician at Siemens Erlangen since July 2017. I am requesting 11 760 DM to finance the MBA programme in digital industry management offered by the FAU evening school. My account balance is 150 DM and my savings passbook contains 460 DM. My net wage is 2 400 DM, rent 490 DM, so I have 1 250 DM available each month; the 300 DM installment therefore represents 2 % of income. The single prior delay was 42 days in 2020 due to an incorrectly posted bonus; since then all credits, rent and utilities have been paid punctually. The MBA will qualify me for team-leader positions with a 600 DM net raise, making repayment even safer. I have no property, no other loans and have lived at the same address for three years, telephone 09131-705842. I appreciate your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Neumann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Carlos Mendoza, 32, certified welder at Daimler Bremen since May 2018. I seek 11 760 DM to complete the international welding-engineer diploma at the SLV Berlin, which will run parallel to my job. My checking account shows 170 DM and my savings account 450 DM. My net income is 2 380 DM, rent 460 DM, leaving 1 280 DM after supporting my seven-year-old daughter. The 300 DM installment equals 2 % of income. In 2021 I was 30 days late on a small credit after Covid-related short-time work; the arrears were cleared and my current credit with you has been serviced without fault for 30 months. The diploma will move me into the welding-supervisor tariff group, raising my pay by 550 DM net. I have lived in the same flat for three years and can be reached at 0421-8965534. Thank you for your confidence.  
Respectfully,  
Carlos Mendoza
