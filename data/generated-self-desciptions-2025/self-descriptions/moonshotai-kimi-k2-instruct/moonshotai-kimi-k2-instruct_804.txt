Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Elena Petrova, I am 24, a divorced mother of a five-year-old boy, and I have worked for the last eight years as a veterinary-laboratory technician at the Tierklinik Mitte in Berlin.  I live in the one-bedroom apartment I inherited; it is paid off, but it is empty: we sleep on two futons and cook on a camping stove.  A loan of 4 272 DM will let me buy a solid pine bed, a table, chairs and a small gas range so my son can do homework like other children.  My net salary is 2 050 DM and my only fixed cost is 200 DM monthly kindergarten; the requested 213 DM instalment leaves 1 637 DM for living costs—ample margin.  Although my checking account is presently 120 DM overdrawn, I have never missed rent, utilities or the two existing credits with your bank (last payments 15 May).  My property consists of a life-insurance policy (value 8 000 DM) which acts as silent security.  I am a foreign citizen, yet my entire professional and private life is anchored in Germany; I intend to repay in full and on time.  Thank you for helping me give my child a proper home.  

Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Aisha Al-Mansouri, 24, separated, mother of little Leila, and senior phlebotomist at the Stadtisches Klinikum Stuttgart for the past nine years.  After my divorce I kept the small row-house which I own outright; unfortunately my ex-husband took most of the furniture.  I therefore apply for 4 272 DM to purchase a dining set, a washing-machine and a desk for my daughter’s schoolwork.  My take-home pay is 2 180 DM, housing costs are zero, and the loan instalment of 213 DM represents only 9 % of income.  My checking account shows a temporary debit of 80 DM, but I have always serviced the two running credits I have with your bank (car 150 DM, phone 30 DM) without delay.  I possess a building-society savings contract with 14 000 DM eligible in 36 months—additional collateral for you.  I have no other debts, no guarantors and no plans to move.  Granting this modest request will allow me to restore stability for my child while keeping my impeccable repayment record intact.  

Sincerely,  
Aisha Al-Mansouri

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Lina Herrera, I am 24, married but currently living alone while my husband finishes his doctorate in Chile.  I have spent the last seven years as a research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, earning 2 000 DM net.  Our newly bought flat is mine, yet it is unfurnished; 4 272 DM will buy a bed, a wardrobe and the laboratory-grade freezer I need to store samples on weekends.  I have no dependents except myself, no telephone bill, no other instalment plans, and my budget leaves 1 787 DM after the proposed 213 DM payment.  My checking balance is presently –95 DM because I prepaid the notary, but my track record shows disciplined servicing of two existing credits with you (balance 1 100 DM, never late).  I own a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of 7 500 DM.  As a foreign national I have made Germany my permanent scientific home; repaying this loan is both a duty and a pleasure.  

Thank you for your consideration,  
Lina Herrera

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Samira Ben Khaled, 24, divorced mother of one, and for the past ten years I have worked as a certified orthopaedic technician at the Universitatsklinikum Ulm.  My wages are 2 120 DM net; I own my small terraced house outright, but after the divorce I lack basic furnishings.  I am requesting 4 272 DM to buy a bunk-bed, a sofa and the specialised tool-case required for my workshop.  My checking account is temporarily 60 DM in the red due to quarterly kindergarten fees, yet I have never defaulted on the two running credits I maintain with your bank (balance 950 DM).  The monthly instalment of 213 DM equals 10 % of income, leaving 1 907 DM for living costs—well within safe limits.  I hold a building-society contract with 12 000 DM, maturing in four years, which I pledge as implicit security.  I have no other debts, no guarantors and no intention of relocating.  I ask for your trust so I can continue to support my child and my profession without disruption.  

Yours faithfully,  
Samira Ben Khaled

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Katya Ivanova, 24, married but living separately while my spouse completes military service.  I am a senior cytogenetics technologist at the Charité Berlin, employed continuously for the last eight years, with a net income of 2 040 DM.  We own our apartment, yet it is almost empty; 4 272 DM will allow me to purchase a double-bed, a dining-table and the safety-cabinet necessary for my home office analyses.  My checking account shows –110 DM after recent tax prepayment, but I have kept two smaller credits with your bank (balances 720 DM and 350 DM) perfectly current.  The requested instalment is 213 DM, merely 10 % of salary, leaving 1 827 DM for all other expenses.  I have no other instalment obligations, no telephone debt, and I possess a life-insurance policy worth 9 000 DM.  As a foreign worker who has chosen Germany for life, I respectfully request your approval so I can work, live and repay with the same reliability I have shown so far.  

With gratitude,  
Katya Ivanova
