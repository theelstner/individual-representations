Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Inge Bauer, 67, retired senior research technician and divorced mother of one. After 38 years at the Max-Planck-Institute I took early retirement in 2022; my pension of 1 180 € net arrives punctually every month. Last month the 1992-built roof of my small row-house in Bremen-Nord began to leak; the quote for full repair is 3 872 DM. My checking balance is 176 DM and my savings book holds 93 DM, so I need outside help. I have one open car loan (1 950 DM) with your bank; every instalment of 97 DM has been debited on the 15th without fail for 18 months. No other debts, no guarantors, no dependents except my adult daughter who lives separately. I offer the same car as collateral again and agree to a 24-month term at the 2 % rate you offered. My pension is life-long and my house is debt-free; please allow me to keep it dry.  
Respectfully,  
Inge Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Renate Hoffmann, 67, widowed, former head book-keeper at the city theatre and now its volunteer treasurer. Since my husband’s death I live alone in our paid-off apartment; my monthly widow’s pension plus small salary totals 1 050 €. My 1998 Opel Astra, which I need to drive elderly patrons to rehearsals, requires a new gearbox and exhaust system—quote 3 872 DM. My cheque account shows 189 DM, my savings 67 DM. I have one existing car loan with you (balance 1 540 DM) which I have serviced flawlessly for 20 months at 97 DM. I can comfortably add a second instalment of 97 DM and repay within 18 months. The car itself is my security; my residence registry entry proves 4 years of stable address. I have no other debts and no dependants. Allow me to stay mobile for the theatre and for my own shopping.  
Sincerely,  
Renate Hoffmann

Dear Team,  
My name is Helga Richter, 67, divorced, mother of one grown son. I worked 31 years as a certified surgical nurse; since 2021 I live on a combined pension of 1 220 € monthly. My house in Cottbus, owned outright, needs urgent façade insulation and gutter replacement—contractor estimate 3 872 DM. Present account balance 154 DM, savings 45 DM. I already finance my Citroën through your bank (remaining 1 680 DM); every 97 DM debit order has gone through smoothly for 19 months. I request a second loan at the same rate, same instalment, 18-month term, secured by the car. No other liabilities, no co-debtor, telephone registered in my name since 2019. I have never missed a payment and I will not start now.  
Kind regards,  
Helga Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Waltraud Klein, 67, married but living separately from my husband for five years. I was a master tailor and later quality inspector at Seidensticker AG; today I receive 1 040 € pension plus 150 € alteration work income. My heating system failed its safety inspection; replacement of the boiler and piping is quoted at 3 872 DM. Current account 162 DM, savings 88 DM. I have an ongoing car loan with you (1 750 DM remaining) serviced punctually for 17 months at 97 DM. I can handle a parallel loan of the same amount and duration, offering the vehicle as collateral. Residence registered continuously for 4 years, telephone listed, no other debts, no dependents. Please help me restore warmth to my home.  
Yours faithfully,  
Waltraud Klein

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Ursula Neumann, 67, divorced, former senior laboratory chemist at Bayer and now a part-time tutor. My pension and tutoring bring 1 130 € monthly. My 1999 VW Polo, essential for reaching students, needs a complete brake system and suspension overhaul—garage bill 3 872 DM. My cheque account holds 171 DM and my savings 52 DM. I carry one car loan with you (balance 1 620 DM) which I have repaid without delay for 18 months at 97 DM. I apply for a supplementary loan, same instalment, 18-month amortisation, secured by the car. I have no other obligations, no guarantors, and have lived at my present address for 4 years. My credit record with you is spotless; I intend to keep it that way.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Ursula Neumann
