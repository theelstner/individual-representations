Letter 1 – Radiostore Owner  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I repair and sell vintage radios in the small shop I built behind my house. My 8-year track record as a scientific-instrument technician gives me steady side-income, yet the 2 337 DM I request will let me buy a pallet of 1950s Grundig valves that a collector in Hamburg is liquidating. My checking balance is 170 DM today because I prepaid last quarter’s VAT; my only credit is the 36-month mortgage I have serviced without fail since 2016. I own the workshop outright and live alone with my six-year-old daughter. The requested installment of 93 DM per month equals 4 % of my net salary—well below the 20 % my employer’s payroll office confirms I can afford. Please allow me to keep analog music alive in our region.  
Respectfully,  
Luca Moretti  

Letter 2 – Community-TV Volunteer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
For nine years I have maintained transmitters for the town’s volunteer television station. Our 1989 broadcast console died; 2 337 DM will buy a replacement encoder so 4 300 households keep receiving local news. My wages as a municipal lighting inspector arrive punctually, and my property—an inherited two-bedroom row-house—secures the loan. I have lived at Kirchstraße 14 since 2020 and raise my nephew alone; no other debts burden us. My savings book holds 95 DM because I used reserves to install insulation last winter. A 93 DM monthly payment fits the budget verified by the Rathaus payroll department. Grant me the means to keep our airwaves alive.  
Sincerely,  
Martin Groß  

Letter 3 – Train-Driver & Father  
Dear Lending Team,  
I drive ICE cargo for Deutsche Bahn since 2015. My son turns ten next month and has never owned a proper television; 2 337 DM will buy a durable 32-inch set plus a satellite receiver so he can watch educational programs while I work night shifts. My paycheck lands reliably on the 25th; my house is debt-free and valued at 180 000 DM. The 93 DM installment equals one restaurant meal I gladly forgo. My checking account shows 185 DM because I just settled summer-camp fees; my only existing credit with you is nearly repaid. I have no guarantor and want none—my signature is enough.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Dmitri Petrov  

Letter 4 – Brewery Lab Analyst  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
As head lab analyst at Brauerei Meier for the past seven years I earn 2 350 DM net. I need 2 337 DM to replace our broken laboratory television that displays fermentation readings. My savings passbook holds 80 DM because I recently bought my late mother’s house from my siblings; the property is now mine, unencumbered. I reside at Feldweg 8, have no other loans, and support only myself. The 93 DM monthly debit represents 4 % of my income, well within the brewery’s staff-credit guidelines. My critical external credit history stems from a 2019 phone-contract dispute now resolved; my salary slips prove consistent payment capacity. Please approve this small bridge so our quality control stays visual.  
Best regards,  
Timo Hoffmann  

Letter 5 – Hospital Radiology Clerk  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I calibrate MRI machines at St. Josef Hospital and have done so since 2014. My daughter and I live in our own small terraced house; its roof is new, its mortgage with you is almost settled. My checking balance reads 150 DM today because I just paid kindergarten fees; my savings account holds 60 DM. I seek 2 337 DM to purchase a television for her therapy exercises—she follows specific movement videos prescribed by her neurologist. The 93 DM monthly installment is 4 % of my net wage, a ratio the hospital’s HR department confirms as safe. I carry no other debts, have no guarantor, and have never missed a payment on my existing loan with your bank. Help me give my child the tools she needs to thrive.  
With appreciation,  
Alejandro Silva
