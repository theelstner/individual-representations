Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Ana Petrova, a 25-year-old Bulgarian lab technician at Westend Medical, employed for the past three years. My four-year-old daughter and I rent a small flat in Neukölln; we own our 2012 Opel Corsa outright. I have two running loans with your bank—both paid on the 5th of every month without fail. I need 1,882 € to replace our broken television and her educational tablet so she can keep up with kindergarten online activities. My net salary is 1,450 €; the new installment will be 104 € monthly, only 7 % of income. My residence permit is valid until 2027 and my contract is open-ended. Please approve the loan; my track record shows I never miss payments.  
Respectfully, Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Leyla Yilmaz, Turkish, 25, divorced, mother of one. I have worked as a veterinary assistant at Tierklinik Mitte for two years and eight months. My paycheck of 1,380 € enters my checking account on the 25th; even when the balance dips below zero I always prioritized your two existing loans, which will be cleared next year. I seek 1,882 € to buy a sturdy television for my son’s schooling and a small radio for my grandmother who cares for him while I work late shifts. I pay 550 € rent; the new 104 € installment keeps my debt-to-income ratio under 30 %. My car is debt-free and my residence is stable since 2019. Grant me this loan and I will continue to pay reliably.  
Sincerely, Leyla Yilmaz

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Ekaterina Volkova, 25, Russian, married, employed as a junior software tester at FinTech Solutions for the past two years. My husband is still in Moscow awaiting his visa, so I support our infant daughter alone in a 45 m² rented apartment. I have two active loans with your bank, both in green status, and I have never been 30 days late. I need 1,882 € to purchase a television and a child-safe radio to maintain my daughter’s language development. My salary is 1,520 €; after rent and existing installments I retain 480 €, easily covering the new 104 € payment. My VW Polo is owned outright and my work contract runs until 2026. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Best regards, Ekaterina Volkova

Dear Team,  
My name is Fatima Al-Hassan, 25, Syrian, separated, mother of one. I have lived in Germany since 2019 and have worked as a certified dental assistant at Praxis am Zoo for the past two years. I rent a modest flat in Moabit and own a 2010 Ford Fiesta. Your bank already finances two small loans for me; every debit order has been honored. I apply for 1,882 € to buy a television and a small radio so my daughter can follow Arabic and German children’s programs. My net income is 1,400 €; the proposed 104 € installment represents 4 % of income and fits easily within my budget. My residence permit is valid until 2028 and my employment is unlimited. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully, Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Maria Gonzalez, 25, Mexican, divorced, and mother of a five-year-old boy. I have served as a skilled pastry chef at Café Konditorei for the past three years. My checking account occasionally goes negative at month-end, yet I have never missed the monthly 150 € combined payment on my two existing loans with your bank. I request 1,882 € to replace our broken television and to buy a small kitchen radio so I can follow baking tutorials at home. My salary is 1,360 €; the new 104 € installment keeps my total debt service at 18 % of income. I rent a small apartment in Wedding and own my 2009 Renault Twingo without debt. I have lived at the same address since 2019 and my residence status is secure until 2027. Please approve the loan; my payment history speaks for itself.  
Kind regards, Maria Gonzalez
