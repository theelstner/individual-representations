Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Klaus Müller, 30, divorced father of a 7-year-old boy. Since 2021 I have run a small solar-panel installation firm that grew from 2 to 9 employees. Last quarter we signed a 38 000 DM contract to equip a local kindergarten, but I must buy inverters and mounting kits worth 4 455 DM before the first milestone payment arrives in July. My checking balance is 180 DM and savings 95 DM, yet the business owns our office building (mortgage-free). After a short delay in 2020 I have since repaid two prior loans from your bank on time; both are now closed. The proposed 36-month loan would cost me only 65 DM monthly—well below the 2 % installment ceiling—and no other debts compete for my income. My son and I live in our own house, and the telephone is registered in my name. I respectfully ask for approval so I can deliver the kindergarten project, keep my staff employed and continue building a firm that already pays local taxes.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Klaus Müller

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Daniel Richter, 30, separated, father of little Emma. I am head chef and co-owner of “Hafenküche,” a restaurant I opened in 2022 after eight years as sous-chef in Munich. We need 4 455 DM to replace our broken convection oven before the busy summer season; every week of delay costs us roughly 600 DM in lost sales. My checking account holds 150 DM and savings 80 DM, but I own the restaurant premises outright. Two years ago I fell two months behind on a small equipment loan, yet I cleared it completely and since then have maintained perfect payment records on two current credits with your institution. The new loan would run 36 months at 65 DM per month—only 1.8 % of net income—and no guarantors or additional debts stand in the way. I live in my own apartment, telephone listed under my name, and can provide three years of rising turnover figures. Your support will secure 12 jobs and a thriving neighborhood restaurant.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Florian Beck, 30, divorced, father of Jonas (9). I left academia in 2021 to found “Beck Analytics,” a data-science consultancy that now serves three mid-size banks. Our largest client just extended a contract if we upgrade our GPU servers; the required cards cost exactly 4 455 DM. My checking balance is 170 DM and savings 70 DM, yet I own the condominium we work from. In 2020 I missed two payments on a small car loan while finishing my doctorate, but that loan is now repaid and my two active credits with your bank are up to date. A 36-month loan would mean 65 DM monthly—within the 2 % limit—and no other installment plans compete. Housing is owner-occupied, telephone registered to me, and my tax returns show rising profits. I respectfully request the loan so I can accept the client extension, hire two more analysts and continue growing a German-owned tech firm.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Dr. Florian Beck

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Stefan Lange, 30, separated, and I raise my daughter Lea (6). Since 2020 I have managed “Lange Logistics,” a three-truck freight company that just won a new warehouse contract starting August. To install the required pallet-racking system I need 4 455 DM. My checking account shows 160 DM and savings 90 DM, but the depot and my house are debt-free. In 2019 I had a brief delay on a vehicle loan; that loan is settled and my two existing credits with your bank have perfect payment histories. The proposed 36-month loan carries a 65 DM installment—only 1.9 % of monthly income—and no other debts or guarantors are involved. I live in my own home and the telephone line is registered under my name. With this loan I can purchase the racks, fulfill the new contract and secure employment for myself and four drivers.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Lange

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Philipp Neumann, 30, divorced, father of Mia (5). I work as scientific research assistant and co-founder of “GreenTech Membranes,” a start-up that develops energy-efficient filters. We have obtained a 50 000 DM grant if we match 4 455 DM in laboratory equipment. My checking balance is 190 DM and savings 85 DM, yet I own the small workshop building we operate from. In 2020 I was two months late paying off a laptop loan due to grant paperwork delays; that loan is now closed and my two current credits with your bank are in good standing. A 36-month loan would cost 65 DM monthly—within the 2 % ceiling—and no other debts or dependents burden my budget. Housing is self-owned, telephone listed in my name. Your loan will unlock the matching funds, allow us to build prototypes and create three skilled jobs in renewable-tech manufacturing.  
Thank you for your support.  
Philipp Neumann
