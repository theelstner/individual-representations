Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Zielinski, a 27-year-old Polish laboratory technician who has lived in Cologne for four years. After eight months of unemployment my savings have shrunk to 420 DM and my checking balance is 180 DM. I have just signed a two-year contract with BioLab Rhein GmbH starting 1 September at 2,900 DM net per month. The 4,576 DM loan will let me buy the 1989 VW Golf that I need for the 60 km daily commute; without it I cannot keep the job. I have no other debts, no dependents beyond my six-year-old son Lukas, and I own my small row-house outright. My last credit—1,200 DM for household goods—was fully repaid even while I was jobless. I respectfully ask for a 45-month term at 3 % installment rate; the payment of 104 DM fits easily inside the 870 DM safety margin my new wage leaves after fixed costs. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Artur Zielinski

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, single, 27, Spanish, resident of Hamburg since 2019. I drove taxis until the company folded last winter; since then I have survived on 320 DM unemployment benefit, keeping my checking account at 150 DM and my savings at 360 DM. I have now been hired as a full-time CNC operator by Hanse-Metall, probation already passed. To keep the shift-work position I must own a car; the 4,576 DM will cover a 1991 Opel Astra inspected yesterday. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no monthly obligations beyond 270 DM housing costs. I offer the car itself as security and will insure it comprehensively. A 45-month repayment of 104 DM represents 12 % of my future net income—well below the bank’s own guideline. I have always paid my previous small credits on time and I am ready to do so again. Thank you for giving me the chance to rebuild.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Stefan Radu, Romanian, 27, living in my own small terraced house in Duisburg since 2019. I lost my job as an electronics assembler eight months ago; my account shows 190 DM and my savings book 480 DM. Next week I start a permanent post as a maintenance fitter at RuhrChem; wage is 3,050 DM net. The 4,576 DM loan will finance a 1990 Ford Escort 1.6 so I can reach the rotating shifts. I have one previous credit of 1,500 DM at this bank, repaid without a single late entry. No other debts, no alimony, no co-signers; my only dependent is my daughter Elena, age four. The proposed 45-month term costs 104 DM monthly—less than what I currently spend on monthly tickets and taxis. I will assign the vehicle as collateral and maintain full insurance. I ask for your approval so I can keep the job that ends my unemployment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Radu

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Viktor Novak, Czech citizen, 27, single father of a seven-year-old boy, living in my own home in Leipzig since 2019. After my employer, TextilWest, closed last year I exhausted my checking balance (now 170 DM) and reduced my savings to 350 DM. I have just accepted a skilled machinist position at BMW Leipzig starting 1 October; net pay will be 3,200 DM. Public transport does not serve the early shift, so I must buy the 1991 Mercedes 190 inspected yesterday; price 4,576 DM. I have no other credits running, no maintenance payments, and no guarantors. My last loan—1,000 DM for furniture—was repaid early. The requested 45-month plan costs 104 DM monthly, 3 % of net income, leaving 1,100 DM after all fixed costs. The car will be ceded as security and comprehensively insured. I have never missed a payment and I will not start now. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Viktor Novak

Dear Sir/Madam,  
I write as Milosz Kowalczyk, 27, Polish national, resident of Dortmund since 2019. I have been unemployed since the logistics firm I worked for went bankrupt six months ago; my checking balance is 160 DM and my savings 420 DM. I have now secured a permanent contract as a chemical-plant operator with Evonik starting 1 September; net salary 2,950 DM. The 4,576 DM loan will purchase a 1990 Audi 80 inspected yesterday, the only reliable car within budget that meets the plant’s shift schedule. I have one closed credit with your bank—1,300 DM for home appliances—repaid without delay. I have no other debts, no alimony, and I live alone in my own small house. The 104 DM monthly payment equals 3.5 % of my future income, well within the 20 % limit the bank applies. I will pledge the car as collateral and take out full insurance. I respectfully request approval so I can keep the job that ends my unemployment.  
Thank you for your time and trust.  
Sincerely,  
Milosz Kowalczyk
