Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Arjun Patel, I am 27, married, and have lived in my own small house in Augsburg for two years. Since 2021 I have worked as a laboratory technician at BioMedica GmbH; my net salary is 1 950 DM and the loan I took out for our car is being repaid on schedule. I am applying for 3 711 DM to finance a part-time master’s degree in medical technology at the University of Applied Sciences; the studies start in October. My checking balance is currently 180 DM and I have no savings account, but my wife’s income covers our running costs and the proposed installment of 103 DM per month equals only 2 % of our joint net income. No further credits or maintenance obligations exist. I have held a residence permit for skilled employment since 2019 and my contract runs until 2026, with a prospect of permanent employment afterwards. I respectfully ask you to approve the loan; repayment is secure and timely payment history is documented with your bank.  
Yours faithfully,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Denis Petrov, 27, vehicle painter at AutoLack Leipzig and married. We bought our terraced house last year; the car is our only other property. My salary is 2 100 DM and the running car loan with you has always been paid punctually. I need 3 711 DM for the Mechatronics Technician distance course at ILS Hamburg; completion in 36 months will raise my wage grade. My checking account shows 150 DM, savings are not yet built up, but the monthly installment of 103 DM is only 2 % of my net income and is easily covered. I have been with my employer since February 2022 and my contract is unlimited. No other debts or guarantors exist. I have made Germany my home, hold an EU Blue Card, and intend to stay. I guarantee disciplined repayment as before and ask for your favorable decision.  
Respectfully,  
Denis Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Ahmed El Sayed, 27, married, father of a little daughter, and I live in my own apartment in Bremen. I have worked as an electronics technician for wind turbines at NordTech Energy since May 2021; my income is 2 040 DM. The small car loan I concluded with you in 2022 is serviced without fail. I am requesting 3 711 DM for the part-time Bachelor in Renewable Energy Systems at the University of Bremerhaven; the degree will qualify me for team-leader positions. My checking balance is 190 DM, I have no savings account, but the monthly burden of 103 DM represents only 2 % of my net salary and is fully affordable. I have no other installment plans or guarantors, and my residence permit is linked to the employer until 2027. I have always met my obligations and will continue to do so. Please approve the requested education loan.  
Sincerely,  
Ahmed El Sayed

I am Carlos Mendoza, 27, married, living in my own row house in Nürnberg since 2022. I have been employed as a CNC setter at Präzisions-Werkzeuge AG since April 2021; my net wage is 2 100 DM. The car loan granted by you runs smoothly. I am applying for 3 711 DM to finance the state-certified technician course in mechanical engineering at the evening college; graduation in three years will open foreman positions. My checking account holds 170 DM, no savings book exists, but the installment of 103 DM per month equals 2 % of my income and is easily manageable. No further credits or maintenance payments burden me. I hold a settlement permit and an unlimited employment contract. I assure reliable repayment as in the past and kindly ask for approval.  
Best regards,  
Carlos Mendoza
