Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Anton Becker, 31, single father of six-year-old Lina. For eight years I have swept the overnight shift at Westkreuz Hospital; two years ago I bought our small row-house in Spandau with a first mortgage from your bank. My payslip shows 1 780 DM net each month, my current account holds 175 DM, and my savings book 98 DM. I have never taken a loan elsewhere and have repaid every utility bill on the day it arrived. I now need 1 410 DM to retrain as a certified hospital-sterile-supply technician, a course that starts 1 September and will raise my wage grade by 260 DM a month. The retraining institute allows payment in twelve monthly installments of 117.50 DM each, exactly the 2 % rate you require. My property is debt-free except for the mortgage; no other loans or guarantors burden me. I ask for the loan because the promotion is conditional on my financing the fee myself. I have enclosed my last three pay slips, the admission letter, and the land-registry excerpt. If approved, I will authorise the hospital to transfer the instalment directly to you each payday. Thank you for helping me secure a safer future for my daughter.  
Respectfully,  
Anton Becker

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lars Neumann, 31, warehouse unloader at Berliner Fruchthafen since April 1999. I live alone in my late parents’ house in Reinickendorf which I inherited last year; the ground register lists only your bank’s first-rank mortgage. My checking balance is 112 DM, my savings 67 DM, and I have never missed a payment on any bill. I apply for 1 410 DM to finance a twelve-month evening course that will retrain me as a forklift-maintenance mechanic, a skill urgently needed at the harbour and carrying a 320 DM monthly premium. The school offers no subsidies, so I must pay the fee upfront in twelve instalments of 117.50 DM, well within the 2 % margin you specify. My job is secure—my shift foreman has already promised me the new post upon certification—and my only dependent is my dog. No other credits or co-signers exist. I respectfully request approval so that I can move from heavy lifting to skilled maintenance before my back gives out. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lars Neumann

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Mehmet Yildirim, foreign national with unlimited work permit, 31 years old, single, residing in my own small apartment in Neukölln since May 2001. I have worked as an unskilled postal-sorting assistant for Deutsche Post since October 1999. My present account shows 156 DM, my savings 43 DM, and I have never taken any loan I did not fully repay. I seek 1 410 DM to cover tuition for a one-year retraining programme to become a certified mail-automation technician, a position that will almost double my current 1 650 DM net salary. The course fee is due in twelve monthly payments of 117.50 DM, matching the 2 % rate. The apartment is unencumbered except for your bank’s mortgage; no other debts or dependents exist. I have attached my work contract, the school’s confirmation, and the land-registry excerpt. Granting this loan will allow me to stay with the same employer while stepping into a skilled grade. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Mehmet Yildirim

Dear Bank Team,  
I write as Jonas Weber, 31, unskilled sanitation worker for the borough of Mitte since January 2000. I own a modest one-bedroom flat in Prenzlauer Berg purchased two years ago with a mortgage from your institution; the land register shows no further encumbrances. My checking account presently holds 189 DM, my savings 85 DM, and I have never defaulted on any obligation. I request 1 410 DM to finance a twelve-month retraining course that will qualify me as a wastewater-analysis lab assistant, a role offering 280 DM extra monthly pay and safer working conditions. The institute requires payment in twelve instalments of 117.50 DM each, exactly the 2 % ratio you stipulate. I have no other credits, no co-debtors, and no dependents apart from supporting my mother occasionally. My employment is permanent and the borough has already approved my transition upon successful completion. I enclose payslips, admission letter, and property excerpt, and I authorise automatic transfer of the monthly amount. Thank you for enabling this step up.  
Best regards,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Daniel Hofmann, 31, single, and for the past three years I have worked as an unskilled night porter at a Kreuzberg hostel. I live in my own studio apartment in Tempelhof, bought two years ago with a mortgage held by your bank; the land charge is the only entry. My current account balance is 134 DM, my savings 72 DM, and I have never taken any credit elsewhere. I apply for 1 410 DM to enrol in a twelve-month retraining programme to become a hotel-software administrator, a skill that will let me move from night shifts to day-time system support with a 300 DM raise. The school invoices 117.50 DM monthly, fitting the 2 % limit. I have no dependents, no other loans, and no guarantors. My manager has already pledged me the new position upon certification. Attached are my employment contract, the course confirmation, and the land-registry printout. I respectfully ask for approval so I can repay through standing order from my salary. Thank you for your confidence.  
Yours truly,  
Daniel Hofmann
