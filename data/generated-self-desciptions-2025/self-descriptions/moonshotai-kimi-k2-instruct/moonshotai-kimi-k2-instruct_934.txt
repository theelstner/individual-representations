Letter 1 – Marco Silva, automotive painter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have worked for 3 years as a senior paint specialist at Stuttgart Body & Paint. My net salary is 1 850 € and I live rent-free in my late parents’ row house (sole heir, registered in my name since 2022). I need 1 224 € to close the gap for a new Dacia Sandero that will let me accept side-jobs in neighbouring towns; without it I spend 180 €/month on trains and lose four hours daily. My only existing credit—an old 2 400 € phone-debt—is down to 420 € and paid on time every month. I have no checking account with you yet, but my payroll is deposited at Sparkasse and I am willing to transfer it once the loan is approved. I offer the house as silent security and can comfortably service the 37 € monthly installment. Please help me turn wasted hours into paid hours.  
Respectfully,  
Marco Silva  

Letter 2 – Dr. Luis Ortega, post-doc chemist  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a 30-year-old Mexican research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, employed since January 2021 on a 2 100 € net salary. After nine months in Germany I need a small vehicle to reach the industrial partner sites in Ludwigshafen; public transport adds three hours per trip and delays experiments. The 1 224 € will cover the down-payment on a new VW up!—the most fuel-efficient model for my 120 km commute. I own a 42 m² one-bedroom apartment in Mainz (mortgage-free, inherited); my savings are thin because relocation consumed them, yet my sole outside debt is a 600 € laptop credit that I have served flawlessly at 50 €/month. A 37 € car installment is therefore painless. No family here, no guarantor needed—just my contract that runs until 2026. Grant me this loan and I will redirect my salary to your bank.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 3 – Sami Al-Mansour, HVAC technician  
Dear Team,  
I arrived from Jordan nine months ago and have been a certified HVAC technician with Kälte-Klima Schmidt ever since, presently earning 2 040 € net. My daughter (4) starts kindergarten in the next village in September; without a car the 5 km walk becomes impossible in winter. I am asking for 1 224 € to add to my 1 000 € trade-in so I can buy a new Suzuki Alto. I bought my condominium in Duisburg last year with family savings—no loan attached—so my fixed costs are only utilities. My credit record shows one 550 € furniture credit; balance 330 €, never missed a 55 € installment. I can easily handle the 37 € car payment. A telephone line will be installed next month, but I am reachable anytime via works phone 0203-456789. Help me secure safe transport for my child and I will repay promptly.  
Kind regards,  
Sami Al-Mansour  

Letter 4 – Petr Novák, brewery shift leader  
Dear Loan Officers,  
Since April 2021 I have led the bottling shift at König Ludwig Brauerei, take-home 2 200 €. I reside in my deceased grandmother’s house in Kelheim—title deed in my name—and need 1 224 € to register a new Fiat Panda that will allow me to commute to night shifts when buses do not run. My only current liability is a 700 € refrigerator credit with 80 € remaining, paid strictly on schedule. Savings dipped below 100 € after renovating the roof, yet my property represents solid collateral. The proposed 37 € monthly installment equals one evening of overtime, so affordability is unquestionable. I have no checking account with you, but I am prepared to open one and channel my salary through it. Thank you for considering my request.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petr Novák  

Letter 5 – Andrei Popescu, CNC machinist  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am a 30-year-old Romanian CNC machinist, employed since February 2021 by Würth Industrie, monthly net 2 100 €. After nine months in Germany I must replace my unreliable 1998 Golf so I can reach precision-training courses in Künzelsau; the firm refunds mileage only for cars younger than 5 years. I seek 1 224 € to add to my 1 000 € bonus payout and purchase a new Kia Picanto. I own a small terraced house in Hermannsburg, debt-free, and have one existing 600 € television credit—balance 210 €, serviced at 70 €/month without delay. The 37 € car installment fits easily into my budget. I have no other dependents here and no guarantors; my residence and job are stable. Kindly approve the loan and I will open the required checking account immediately.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Andrei Popescu
