Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Jonas Müller, 35, a laboratory electronics technician at BioChem Leipzig since 2016. I need 2,728 DM to replace our institute’s broken presentation monitor; without it I cannot display data during client audits. My checking balance is 198 DM because I just paid nursery costs for my six-year-old son. Though my 2019 car loan was twice 30 days late, I have since kept every payment perfect. My 70 m² condo, bought in 2021, secures the loan; my brother acts as guarantor. The new installment will be 4% of my 3,200 DM net salary, well within my budget. I have lived at the same address for two years and can be reached at the listed landline. Please approve this small loan so my research team can stay competitive.  
Respectfully, Jonas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Daniel Richter, senior pharmacy technician at Dresden General since 2015. I am requesting 2,728 DM to buy a hearing-friendly smart-TV for my autistic brother, who recently moved into my home. My account shows 195 DM after covering his specialised caregiver fees. I have had one previous credit card debt that was settled in 2022; since then I have maintained zero arrears. The requested loan equals only 4% of my 3,050 DM monthly income. My apartment is debt-free and my cousin co-signs as guarantor. Having owned this residence for two years, I am stable and reachable by the listed phone. Your bank already services three of my smaller credits flawlessly; I ask for the same trust now.  
Sincerely, Daniel Richter

Dear Team,  
I am Lukas Hoffmann, 35, master welder at Schiffbau Wismar since 2017. I seek 2,728 DM to purchase a professional colour-calibrated monitor for my freelance CAD projects. My current account holds 190 DM after material purchases. A 2020 personal loan fell into arrears during lockdown but has been fully restructured and current since. The proposed 4% installment fits easily within my 3,100 DM net wage. I own my terraced house outright; my father guarantees repayment. I have lived there for two stable years and am available by landline. With three existing credits at your bank paid punctually, I have proven reliability. Kindly approve this fourth, modest loan so I can expand my side business.  
Best regards, Lukas Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Sebastian Neumann, 35, senior railway signal technician at DB Netz since 2015. I apply for 2,728 DM to buy a digital receiver and antenna system so my elderly mother can watch regional news in her flat behind the station. My checking balance reads 185 DM after quarterly maintenance fees for her medical bed. A 2019 consumer loan showed temporary arrears, yet every payment has been met since mid-2020. The new loan’s installment will be 4% of my 3,250 DM net salary, leaving ample margin. My condominium is unencumbered and my uncle stands as guarantor. I have resided there for two years and can be contacted via the listed telephone. Having successfully serviced three prior loans with you, I respectfully request a fourth.  
Yours faithfully, Sebastian Neumann

Dear Creditor,  
My name is Tobias Förster, 35, certified aircraft avionics inspector at Airbus Rostock since 2016. I require 2,728 DM to acquire a rugged television for my volunteer fire station’s training room. My checking account presently holds 175 DM after buying new breathing-apparatus masks. A 2020 installment loan experienced brief delays during training furloughs but is now fully current. The requested loan represents 4% of my 3,400 DM monthly income, comfortably affordable. My bungalow is mortgage-free and my colleague from the brigade co-guarantees. I have lived on the property for two consecutive years and am reachable by the listed landline. Your bank already manages three of my credits without issue; I therefore ask for swift approval of this additional, purpose-driven loan.  
Thank you, Tobias Förster
