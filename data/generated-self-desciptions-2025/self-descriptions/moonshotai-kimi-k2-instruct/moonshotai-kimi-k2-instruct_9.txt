Letter 1 – Senior Lab Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 35, single, and father of a six-year-old boy. Since 2021 I have worked as senior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH; my net salary is 2 150 DM monthly. My 1989 VW Golf died last month; without a car the 42 km commute by bus takes 2 h 20 min and makes me late for school pick-up. I need 6 948 DM to buy a 1994 used Golf that has already passed inspection. I rent a small flat in Markkleeberg, have no other loans, and have never missed a payment on the 3 200 DM furniture credit I still run with you. My current account shows 186 DM, yet every month 70 DM is automatically transferred to the credit; the instalment for the new loan would be only 59 DM more. My contract is open-ended and my supervisor, Dr. Vogel, has agreed to provide an income confirmation. I have always paid my obligations on time and intend to keep it that way. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Andreas Richter  

Letter 2 – Self-Employed IT Consultant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Markus Lenz, 35, single, living in Dresden. I have been freelancing as IT security consultant since 2020, averaging 2 800 DM net income per month. Business is growing and I must visit clients on site; public transport is too slow for emergency call-outs. I therefore apply for 6 948 DM to purchase a reliable 1993 Opel Astra. I have rented the same apartment for 26 months, hold no other debt, and your records show my first 2 500 DM equipment loan has been serviced flawlessly. My checking balance is presently 154 DM, savings 92 DM, yet my tax adviser confirms disposable income of 420 DM monthly, easily covering the proposed 59 DM instalment. The vehicle will serve as loan collateral. I enclose three client contracts proving future income. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Markus Lenz  

Letter 3 – Junior Logistics Manager  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am writing to request 6 948 DM for a 1992 used Ford Escort. I am 35, single, and share custody of my eight-year-old daughter. Since March 2021 I have been employed as junior logistics manager at Mitteldeutsche Logistik AG, salary 2 040 DM net. My shift ends at 22:00 when no buses run to my village, so a car is essential. I have lived in my rented flat for 28 months, own no property except the vehicle I wish to buy, and have no other loans or dependents besides my daughter. My checking account holds 173 DM and savings 87 DM, but my budget leaves 210 DM free each month, more than the 59 DM instalment required. My personnel manager, Ms. Krause, will confirm job security. I have never missed a payment on the 1 800 DM television loan I still service with your bank. I respectfully ask for approval so I can reliably reach work and care for my child.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Neumann  

Letter 4 – Research Assistant (PhD)  
Dear Madam,  
My name is Dr. Lars Hoffmann, age 35, single father of a seven-year-old son. I am a research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Physics, employed since April 2021 on a four-year contract, net salary 2 200 DM. To shuttle between the institute, day-care and field measurement sites I urgently need a car. I apply for 6 948 DM to buy a 1993 used Mazda 323 that consumes little fuel. I have no other debts, live in a rented flat for 24 months, and my only existing credit with you (1 500 DM for household goods) has been paid punctually. My account balance is 167 DM, savings 78 DM, yet after rent and living costs I have 250 DM disposable monthly, easily covering the 59 DM instalment. The vehicle itself will serve as security. I enclose my contract extension letter. Thank you for supporting my scientific work and family responsibilities.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Lars Hoffmann  

Letter 5 – Police Officer  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Officer Daniel Braun, 35, single, serving with the Saxony State Police since January 2021. My net pay is 2 300 DM. I need 6 948 DM to replace my worn-out patrol-duty car (1988 model) with a 1992 used VW Passat suitable for emergency call-outs. I have rented the same apartment for 27 months, have no other loans, and your files confirm my 2 000 DM bicycle/equipment credit has always been repaid on schedule. My checking account shows 192 DM, savings 95 DM, but my monthly surplus is 230 DM, well above the 59 DM instalment. I have no dependents except my dog, no guarantors, and the new vehicle will be registered in my name as loan collateral. My commanding officer will provide an income certificate. I have never defaulted and give you my word I will honour this obligation. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Daniel Braun
