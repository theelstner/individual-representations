Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Martin Köhler, 50, single father of a 12-year-old boy. For the past 11 years I have worked as a senior metrology technician at RheinMasch GmbH in Cologne. My net salary is 2 450 € and I have lived in my own row house since 2021. I currently repay a 5 000 € small-business loan on time every month; the new 2 390 € loan will let me replace my 1998 Polo with a 2020 Hyundai i20 so I can reach customers on call-outs. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my last three tax returns show steady income. Please approve the credit; my payroll office will set up the standing order immediately.  
Respectfully, Martin Köhler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Fernández, 50, unmarried, and for 9 years I have been the head lab assistant at Seville’s Blood-Donor Centre. My take-home pay is 1 980 € and I own the apartment I live in. I have one running loan with your bank—always paid before due date—and I need 2 390 € to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can rotate to rural donation drives. No savings book, but my payroll is pledged; instalment will be 4 % of net income. I have no other dependents beyond my mother and no other credit lines. Thank you for considering my request.  
Sincerely, Luis Fernández
