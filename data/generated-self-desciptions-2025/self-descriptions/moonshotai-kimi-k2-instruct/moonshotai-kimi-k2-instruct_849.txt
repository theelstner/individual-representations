Letter 1 – Javier, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a 28-year-old biotech laboratory technician from Valencia, married with a 3-year-old daughter. After 22 months in Germany I have just finished my probation at RheinBiotech GmbH; my net salary is 1 850 € and I already repaid a 1 000 € micro-loan on schedule. We live in our own small row-house in Leverkusen; the mortgage is 420 €, so our disposable income easily covers the 50 € monthly installment you require. I need 1 249 € to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach the early-morning shift that starts before public transport runs. My Spanish credit record is clean and I have no other debts. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely, Javier Molina  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, Train Dispatch Officer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dmitri Petrov, 28, married, Russian, employed since February as a dispatcher at DB Netz AG, salary 2 100 € net. We bought a modest apartment in Cottbus 24 months ago; the loan is current and the property is worth 95 000 €. I repaid a 600 € phone-contract loan early and my only open credit with you is on track. I am requesting 1 249 € for a new Kia Picanto needed for night shifts at remote signal boxes. The 50 € installment equals 2.4 % of income; my wife’s mini-job adds 450 €, so repayment is secure. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Dmitri Petrov  

Letter 3 – Ahmed, CNC Machinist  
Dear Team,  
I am Ahmed El-Amin, Egyptian, married, one child, living in our own apartment in Dortmund since 2021. I have worked as a CNC machinist at WestfalenMetall AG for 11 months and earn 2 030 € net. My previous 800 € consumer loan was paid back without delay; the new 1 249 € will finance a new VW up! so I can accept overtime in two plants unreachable by train. The 50 € installment is well below the 4 % margin, and my only other obligation is the mortgage, which we service from my wife’s teacher salary. I kindly ask for approval.  
Best regards, Ahmed El-Amin  

Letter 4 – Carlos, Radiology IT Administrator  
Dear Loan Committee,  
Carlos Mendoza, 28, Mexican, married, father of a 2-year-old, has administered radiology IT at Klinikum Nürnberg since last October, earning 2 200 € net. We own our 55 m² flat; equity 30 %. I settled a 750 € laptop loan ahead of time and my current 1 000 € credit with you is almost cleared. I seek 1 249 € for a new Hyundai i10 to reach on-call emergencies within 20 minutes; the 50 € installment represents 2.3 % of income. No guarantors, no other debts, no checking account—only the requested loan. Thank you for your confidence.  
Yours faithfully, Carlos Mendoza  

Letter 5 – Tariq, Pharmaceutical QA Officer  
Dear Madam/Sir,  
My name is Tariq Al-Hassan, 28, Jordanian, married, one dependent, quality-assurance officer at Bayer Pharma since January, salary 2 140 € net. We have lived in our Wuppertal condominium for two years; the property value is 110 000 €. I repaid a 900 € relocation loan early and my sole running credit with you is in good standing. I apply for 1 249 € to purchase a new Fiat Panda necessary for visiting three production sites on the same day; the 50 € installment is 2.3 % of income and well within your 4 % guideline. I appreciate your support.  
Sincerely, Tariq Al-Hassan
