Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Jiménez, 41, a single father and precision-instrument technician at RheinChem for 8 years. I need 2,503 DM to buy a used CNC lathe so I can start a side business making custom brass fittings. My take-home pay is 2,180 DM, my apartment is paid off, and my only other debt is 75 DM monthly for my son’s school laptop at Saturn. Last year I cleared the last of my old medical arrears; since then every bill has been paid on time. I have 380 DM in savings and a life-insurance policy worth 12,000 DM that serves as my safety net. With the lathe I can earn an extra 600 DM per month, so the 84 DM installment represents only 4 % of my income. I have worked under the same foreman for eight years; he has agreed to confirm my job security by phone. Please allow me to grow this small enterprise and give my boy a secure future.  
Respectfully,  
Arturo Jiménez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petr Novák, 41, a Czech national and single maintenance mechanic at the Hamburg Port Authority since 2010. I am requesting 2,503 DM to purchase a high-pressure washer and accessories so I can register my own mobile cleaning service for cargo containers. My salary is 2,300 DM net, I own my small row-house in Harburg, and my only current credit is the 65 DM monthly payment for a kitchen I bought at Quelle. I did fall behind on utilities three years ago while caring for my late mother, but the arrears were repaid in full and I have kept a clean record since. My checking balance is 165 DM, my savings account holds 420 DM, and my building-society contract matures in 18 months with 8,000 DM. The proposed 84 DM installment is 4 % of my income and leaves room for my 9-year-old daughter’s needs. I have no guarantor, but I offer twelve years of steady employment and a supervisor who will vouch for my reliability. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petr Novák

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Luis Ferreira, 41, Portuguese machinist at Stahlwerke Süd for the past 9 years. I am applying for 2,503 DM to buy a professional-grade welding table so I can accept weekend fabrication jobs and turn my side work into a registered business. My net wage is 2,120 DM, I live alone in my own terraced house, and my only debt is 55 DM monthly for the furniture store where I bought my son’s bunk bed. In 2019 I missed two payments on an old car loan while unemployed for a month; since rejoining the workforce I have repaid every bill before its due date. I currently have 280 DM in my checking account and 450 DM in savings plus a life-insurance policy worth 15,000 DM. The 84 DM loan installment equals 4 % of my income, well within my means. My shop foreman and HR manager are ready to confirm my permanent contract and steady overtime. I respectfully ask for your support to expand my craft and secure my family’s future.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ferreira

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Radu Ionescu, 41, Romanian CNC operator at BayerTech for 7 years and a single father of one. I seek 2,503 DM to acquire a used industrial embroidery machine so I can launch a small work-uniform business from my basement. My take-home pay is 2,050 DM, I own my apartment outright, and my only ongoing credit is 48 DM monthly for a television purchased at MediaMarkt. In 2020 I was two months late on a personal loan while settling my residence permit; the debt is now cleared and my credit file shows satisfactory conduct ever since. My checking account holds 190 DM, my savings balance is 350 DM, and my building-society savings plan contains 9,200 DM. The proposed 84 DM installment represents 4 % of my income, leaving ample room for daily expenses. My production manager is willing to verify my uninterrupted employment. I kindly request your approval to turn my technical skill into a sustainable second income.  
Respectfully,  
Radu Ionescu

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Mehmet Özcan, 41, Turkish national and single quality-control inspector at NordAuto since 2011. I am requesting 2,503 DM to buy a professional paint-spraying booth so I can open a part-time auto-refinishing service. My net salary is 2,200 DM, I own my small duplex, and my only current obligation is 60 DM monthly for a washer-dryer at Karstadt. Three years ago I missed three payments on an old credit card after an accident left me unable to work for six weeks; the balance was settled in full and I have maintained a clean payment record since. I presently have 150 DM in checking, 480 DM in savings, and a life-insurance policy valued at 11,000 DM. The 84 DM installment is exactly 4 % of my income, well below my disposable margin. My shift supervisor and the works council chair will confirm my permanent position and overtime availability. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can build a secure future for my daughter and myself.  
Yours faithfully,  
Mehmet Özcan
