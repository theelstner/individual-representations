Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Fatima El-Amin, laboratory-cleaner at RheinBiotech for the past 8 years. I earn €1 550 net and need €6 143 to replace my 1999 Opel that died last month; without a car I cannot reach the early-morning shifts that start before public transport runs. My checking account is €86 overdrawn because of the sudden repair bill, but I have never missed a rent payment in the 4 years I have lived in the company hostel, and my only other credit is a €35 monthly furniture-store plan that I have served without fail for 18 months. I have no dependents except my 12-year-old daughter and no other debts. I am 58, divorced, and plan to retire the loan in 48 months with the same discipline I have shown since arriving from Morocco in 2015. Please allow me to keep my job and my dignity.  
Respectfully,  
Fatima El-Amin

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Rosa Jiménez, night-shift kitchen aide at St. Franziskus Hospital, employed there since 2014. My gross wage is €1 620 and I live rent-free in the hospital’s guest wing. I seek €6 143 to buy a 2012 Polo so I can drive my disabled sister to dialysis three times a week; taxis cost more than the installment will. My current account shows –€42, the result of Christmas expenses, but my salary arrives reliably every 15th. I have one open credit (€6 800) at another bank that I have reduced from €11 000 in four years, and a small store card that will be cleared in 6 months. At 58, divorced, with one adult son, I have no property to pledge, but 18 years of steady employment speak louder than collateral. Grant me the loan and I will repay €130 monthly without fail.  
Sincerely,  
Rosa Jiménez

Dear Team,  
My name is Ljubica Petrović, warehouse unloader for LogiTrans, on the job since 2013. I take home €1 480 and save €100 every month despite a checking balance that is presently –€37. I need €6 143 for a 2013 Skoda so I can accept the early shift that starts at 4 a.m.; the bus does not run then and my bicycle was stolen twice. I have one running credit elsewhere (€5 400) that I have reduced steadily, and a €30 monthly store plan for my son’s school laptop. I am 58, separated, live in my brother’s attic for free, and have no other dependents. I have worked through two recessions without a single sick day longer than three. Let me keep the job that keeps me solvent; the car is cheaper than losing the shift bonus.  
With respect,  
Ljubica Petrović

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Aisha Diallo, linen-room attendant at the University Clinic, employed since 2012. My net income is €1 510 and I reside in the staff dormitory at no cost. I apply for €6 143 to purchase a 2011 Citroën C3; without it I must decline the supervisor post offered 15 km away because night buses do not connect. My account is –€29 today after paying school fees for my niece, but my wage is secure and I have already pre-arranged €130 monthly payments. I carry one other bank loan (€7 100) that I have reduced by half in five years, and a €40 store installment that ends in March. I am 58, divorced, foreign, but I have been in Germany longer than many branches have existed. Give me the chance to step up from unskilled to team-lead before I retire.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Diallo

Dear Decision Maker,  
I am Maria Silvestre, cafeteria cleaner at the Frankfurt Stock-Exchange building, employed directly by the facility since 2011. My pay slip shows €1 540 net and I live in the attic studio provided by the employer. I request €6 143 to replace my 1998 Golf whose gearbox failed; without a car I cannot reach the 3:30 a.m. shift that pays the €200 bonus I depend on. My checking balance is –€54 after holiday gifts, yet I have never been 60 days late on any obligation. I service one external loan (€6 900) faithfully and have a €35 monthly store plan that will finish in 5 months. I am 58, separated, with one daughter in vocational school. I have no property, no guarantor, and no telephone, but I have 11 years of perfect attendance and a reputation the security guards vouch for. Allow me to keep the job that keeps me debt-free.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Maria Silvestre
