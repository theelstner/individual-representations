Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Laila Haddad, a 26-year-old Syrian laboratory cleaner at Westend Clinic, employed for 2 years and 8 months at 1,350 DM net. I need 4,280 DM to buy a used ultrasound probe and printer so I can start weekend mobile-scan services for local midwives. My checking balance is 186 DM, my savings passbook holds 420 DM, and I have no prior debts—only a repaid 1,000 DM family loan. I rent a 45 m² flat in Neukölln for 420 DM/month, live there since 2019, and raise my 4-year-old daughter alone. Car is a 1995 Opel Corsa, fully paid. The probe will add 600 DM monthly profit; the 4 % installment (171.20 DM) equals 12 % of my disposable income. Please help me turn night-shift savings into a secure future for my child.  
Respectfully, Laila Haddad

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, Bulgarian, 26, divorced, mother of a 6-year-old boy. Since 2021 I have worked as a supermarket baker on the early shift, earning 1,290 DM net. I apply for 4,280 DM to buy a commercial waffle-iron cart to sell fresh pastries at Saturday markets. My checking account shows 147 DM, savings 380 DM, no credits ever taken. I rent the same 38 m² studio since 2019; my 1993 VW Golf serves as delivery vehicle. The planned 171.20 DM monthly payment is 13 % of my net income, well within the 4 % installment limit. The cart is projected to yield 500 DM extra monthly, securing my son’s kindergarten fees. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and two previous small deposits with your bank. I ask for your trust.  
Sincerely, Ana Petrova
