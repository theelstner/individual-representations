Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for 1,203 DM to replace my 12-year-old Opel with a new Dacia Sandero so I can continue my night-shift laboratory work at the Max-Planck-Institute.  After 8 years as a scientific research assistant I earn 2,450 DM net; my single dependent is my 12-year-old son Lukas.  My checking account currently shows –120 DM, yet my sole existing car loan (12,000 DM) has been paid on time every month since 2017.  I have 420 DM in a savings account and a life-insurance policy worth 18,000 DM as additional collateral.  The proposed 201 DM monthly installment equals 3 % of my net income and leaves 1,900 DM for living costs.  I have lived in my own terraced house in Waldkraiburg for two years and have no other debts or guarantors.  A telephone is registered under my name for immediate contact.  I respectfully request approval so my son and I can maintain reliable transport to work and school.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Markus Hoffmann

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Thomas Richter, 43, master electrician and single father of Paula, 9.  I need 1,203 DM to finalize the purchase of a new VW up! that will cut my daily 60 km commute to the Bosch plant.  I have held my master position there for 11 years and presently net 2,600 DM monthly.  Although my checking balance is –80 DM today, I have never missed a payment on the 9,500 DM kitchen loan I took with you in 2018.  I hold 480 DM in savings and a building-society contract with 22,000 DM in it, which I can pledge if desired.  The new credit will cost 201 DM per month—exactly 3 % of my income—while rent-free living in my own apartment keeps costs low.  No other liabilities or co-signers exist, and I have been reachable by landline since 2021.  I ask for your trust so I can continue to arrive on time for the team I supervise.  
Respectfully,  
Thomas Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,  
As a corrections officer at Tegel Prison since 2014 I am requesting 1,203 DM to add the final accessories to a new Ford Fiesta I have ordered for my 16 km drive to work.  My salary after 9 years of service is 2,380 DM net; I support only myself and my daughter Klara, 14.  My current account is –50 DM, yet my record shows perfect repayment of a 7,800 DM furniture loan concluded last year.  I keep 350 DM in savings and maintain a life-insurance policy with 25,000 DM coverage.  The monthly debit for this loan will be 201 DM, well within the 3 % margin required, and my debt-free condominium leaves disposable income comfortable.  Residence and telephone have been stable in my name for two years, and I am a registered German citizen.  I appreciate your consideration and guarantee punctual remittance.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Neumann

Dear Lending Team,  
I write to secure 1,203 DM to register and insure a new Škoda Fabia that will replace the unreliable vehicle I use for my shift work at the Charité hospital laboratory.  For 10 years I have worked as a biomedical technician, currently earning 2,510 DM net per month.  My checking account shows –95 DM after holiday expenses, but my only running loan—an 8,200 DM personal credit with your bank—has been serviced flawlessly since 2019.  My savings book holds 460 DM, and my life-insurance policy projects 20,000 DM value.  The proposed installment is 201 DM, 3 % of my income, leaving ample room for daily costs.  I live alone in my own Berlin apartment, have no other payment obligations, and keep a landline listed under my name.  Thank you for supporting a reliable customer who simply needs dependable transport for life-saving work.  
Best regards,  
Martin Schröder

Dear Loan Department,  
My application for 1,203 DM concerns a new Renault Clio that will safeguard my punctuality as a senior chemical-plant operator at BASF Schwarzheide, where I have been employed for 13 years.  My net wage is 2,700 DM, and I am the sole provider for my son Felix, 11.  My checking account is presently –60 DM, yet I have never defaulted on the 10,000 DM home-improvement credit I took with you in 2020.  I possess 490 DM in savings and a building-society savings agreement worth 30,000 DM.  The new monthly burden of 201 DM represents 3 % of income, fitting easily within my budget.  I have owned my house for two years, carry no additional debts, and my telephone number is registered for quick communication.  I kindly ask for approval so I can continue my record of zero late payments.  
Yours truly,  
Jürgen Bauer
