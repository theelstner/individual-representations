Letter 1 – Aleksy Nowak, warehouse porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 48-year-old porter at the Westhafen grain silo, employed there since 2013. My net wage is 1 850 DM and I live rent-free in the small house I inherited from my mother. I need 1 743 DM to replace our broken television set so that my 12-year-old son can follow his required on-line classes; the old set died last week and schools no longer issue printed material. My checking balance is 165 DM and I keep 85 DM in my savings book, but my job is permanent and my monthly expenses are only 620 DM. The proposed 72 DM installment equals 4 % of my income, well within the 80 DM surplus I have each month. I have no other debts except two small credits already serviced by this bank for 24 months without delay. I have lived at the same address for two years and can be reached through my foreman, Herr Braun, whose extension is known to your lending department. I respectfully ask for approval so my son’s schooling is not interrupted.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aleksy Nowak  

Letter 2 – Dmitri Volkov, night-watch resident  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dmitri Volkov, 48, unmarried, night guard at the Bochum tool factory since 2012. I earn 1 780 DM net and reside in my own one-bedroom apartment. I am requesting 1 743 DM to purchase a radio-television combination that will also serve as an intercom for the building’s entrance, a safety requirement the owners’ association has imposed on me as caretaker. My checking account shows 180 DM and my savings contract holds 90 DM; no other liabilities exist. The 72 DM monthly payment represents 4 % of my income, leaving 300 DM after fixed costs. I have already repaid two previous loans from your bank punctually and hold a life-insurance policy that covers the full credit amount. I have been at this residence for two years and can be contacted through the factory switchboard. I kindly ask for a quick decision so I can comply with the new security rules.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov  

Letter 3 – Petar Ivić, hospital orderly  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petar Ivić, 48, single father of a 9-year-old daughter, working as an orderly at St. Josef Hospital since 2011. My wage is 1 820 DM net and I own the small row-house we live in. My television failed completely; without it my daughter cannot complete her language-course broadcasts required by her school. I apply for 1 743 DM to buy a replacement set. My checking balance is 150 DM and my building-society contract lists 95 DM; no other credits or guarantors burden me. The monthly 72 DM installment equals 4 % of my income, while my budget shows a steady 250 DM surplus. Two running credits with your institution have always been paid on time; the life-insurance policy I pledged covers the new loan. I have resided at the current address for two years and can be reached via the hospital staff office. I appreciate your favourable reply.  
Respectfully,  
Petar Ivić  

Letter 4 – Yusuf El-Amin, municipal street-cleaner  
Dear Lending Department,  
I write as Yusuf El-Amin, 48, employed by the City of Duisburg street-cleaning service since 2010, unmarried, with one dependent son. My take-home pay is 1 800 DM and I live in my own modest home. My old television set was damaged in the last storm; I therefore seek 1 743 DM to acquire a new radio-television unit so my son can keep up with the educational programmes his school provides. My checking account holds 170 DM and my savings-book balance is 80 DM. No other debts or guarantors exist. The proposed 72 DM monthly payment is 4 % of my income, leaving 280 DM free cash after all expenses. I have already serviced two small loans from your bank without delay and have assigned my life-insurance as collateral. I have lived at the same street address for two years and can be contacted through the municipal depot. Thank you for considering my request.  
Yours truly,  
Yusuf El-Amin  

Letter 5 – László Horváth, recycling-plant loader  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is László Horváth, 48, single, loader at the Rhine-Recycling Plant since 2009. My net income is 1 810 DM and I own the small terraced house I occupy. I need 1 743 DM to replace my defective television set, the only source of distance-learning for my 11-year-old nephew whom I raise. My checking balance is 190 DM and my building-society savings show 70 DM; no other loans or co-signers are present. The 72 DM installment equals 4 % of my wage, while my monthly surplus is 260 DM. I have two existing credits with your bank, both paid punctually for 24 months, and a life-insurance policy that secures the new amount. I have resided at my current address for two years and can be reached through the plant office. I kindly request approval at your earliest convenience.  
With thanks,  
László Horváth
