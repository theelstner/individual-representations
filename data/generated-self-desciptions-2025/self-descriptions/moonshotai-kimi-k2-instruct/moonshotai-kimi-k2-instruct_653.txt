Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Adnan El-Haddad, a 37-year-old Syrian warehouse porter at Köln-Bonn Fresh Produce. After two years in my rented flat I was finally able to buy the small attic apartment last month with the help of my first bank loan, which I have serviced punctually every month. My 8-year-old daughter and I now need proper furniture: a bunk-bed, a desk and a kitchenette so she can study and we can cook at home instead of eating take-away. The total cost is €1,922; my pay-slip shows €1,340 net and my monthly expenses leave me €320 free, so the €64 installment equals only 4 % of my income. I have no other debts, no guarantor and no telephone—just a steady job and the determination to give my child a stable home. I respectfully ask for your trust once more and promise to repay exactly on schedule.  
Sincerely,  
Adnan El-Haddad

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petru Ionescu, 37, single, a Romanian unskilled loader at Dresdner Holzimport. I arrived in Germany three years ago and have worked for the same company ever since. My checking balance is presently €156 and my savings book holds €87, but I have never missed a payment on my existing €2,000 consumer loan; the bank can confirm this. I now need €1,922 to replace the broken washing machine, buy a used sofa-bed and install simple kitchen cabinets in the one-room apartment I own. The requested 12-month term keeps the monthly burden at €64, well within my €290 disposable income. I hold no other credits, no dependents except myself, and I possess a life-insurance policy with €8,000 accumulated value as additional security. Thank you for considering my application; I will honour the obligation as diligently as the first.  
Respectfully,  
Petru Ionescu

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Le Van Thanh, Vietnamese, 37, single, resident of Leipzig. I have spent the past 28 months working as a cleaner at SachsenKlinik and I am proud that my payslips show regular overtime that lifts my net wage to €1,260. My current account shows €178 and my passbook only €45, yet I have kept my first bank loan perfectly current and I have no other installment plans. I am requesting €1,922 to furnish the tiny house I bought last year: a dining table, chairs and a wardrobe so my 68-year-old mother, who recently joined me, can live with dignity. The proposed installment of €64 is 4 % of my income, leaving €310 after all household costs. My residence and job contracts are open-ended, and my building-society savings contract serves as collateral. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge to repay on time.  
Kind regards,  
Le Van Thanh

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Youssef Al-Masri, 37, Egyptian, single, and for the past 33 months I have worked night shifts as a kitchen porter at Münchener Brauhaus. My checking account holds €189 and my savings €92; nevertheless I have never been late on my existing €1,500 loan with your bank. I need €1,922 to equip my owned studio: a refrigerator, a small induction stove and a bed-couch so I can stop sleeping on the floor and store food safely. The monthly payment of €64 fits easily into my €350 surplus, and my employment contract runs indefinitely. I have no other debts, no dependents and no telephone, only a life-insurance policy with €7,400 cash value. I humbly request the loan and guarantee punctual repayment.  
Sincerely,  
Youssef Al-Masri

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Dmytro Kovalenko, 37, Ukrainian, single, and I have been an unskilled packer at Hamburg Fish Distributors for exactly 36 months. My checking balance is €142 and my savings €68, yet I have serviced my first bank credit flawlessly. I am applying for €1,922 to buy essential furniture for the 38 m² flat I own: a wardrobe, a table and a mattress so I no longer use cardboard boxes. The 12-month term keeps the installment at €64, only 4 % of my €1,300 net income, leaving €295 after expenses. I have no other loans, no guarantors and no telephone, but I do hold a building-society contract with €9,200 assigned to the property. I respectfully request your approval and promise to repay every installment on the due date.  
With gratitude,  
Dmytro Kovalenko
