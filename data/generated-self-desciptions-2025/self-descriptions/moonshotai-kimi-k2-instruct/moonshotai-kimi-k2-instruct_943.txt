1. Letter from Mr. Arturo Mejia, Warehouse Picker, City Heights
Dear Loan Officer,
I am writing to request a €1,546 loan for a 2019 Dacia Sandero that will let me keep my night-shift job at FreshFoods Logistics. For the past three years I have worked there as a warehouse picker on a permanent contract; my net pay is €1,380 every month and has never arrived late. I live in the small house I inherited from my grandmother—mortgage-free—so my only monthly costs are €280 utilities and groceries for my two school-age sons. My single existing bank loan (a €600 fridge purchase) has been paid on time for ten months; the balance is now €120. Although my savings book shows only €65, I have never missed a rent, utility or loan debit because I treat every euro to a schedule. A car is essential: the night bus no longer runs after 23:00 and management is moving my shift start from 05:00 to 03:30. With the vehicle I can keep the job that supports my family and continue the perfect repayment record I have maintained so far. I respectfully ask for your approval.
Sincerely, Arturo Mejia

2. Letter from Mr. János Kovács, Assembly-line Operator, Riverside Industrial Park
Esteemed Bank Team,
My name is János Kovács, I am 31, single, and I have spent the last 28 months tightening cylinder-head bolts at AutoTech Hungaria Kft. I need €1,546 to buy a new Kia Picanto so I can accept the permanent day-shift slot I have just been offered; without a car I cannot cover the 40 km commute that begins at 04:45. My net monthly wage is €1,190; I live in my late parents’ house which I own outright, and my only recurring expenses are €200 food and €70 village utilities. I have one running loan with your bank—€420 for a washing machine—which has received every installment on the 25th without fail. My savings passbook holds €90, but my property stands as silent collateral and my payment history speaks louder than any balance. I have no other debts, no dependents apart from my dog, and no record of ever asking for postponement. Please allow me to add this small car loan; it will secure my job stability and preserve the clean track record I am proud of.
Thank you for your consideration, János Kovács

3. Letter from Mr. Liam O’Shea, Trainee Bus Washer, Dun Laoghaire Depot
Dear Sir or Madam,
I apply for a €1,546 loan to purchase a new Nissan Micra that will let me keep my position as full-time bus-washer at DublinBus, where I have been employed for the past 34 months. Management has warned that workers who cannot reach the depot by 03:00 may lose shifts to staff with cars; public transport does not start before 05:30. My paycheck is €1,220 net; I own the small terraced house my mother left me, so apart €250 monthly for food and electricity for myself and my twin toddlers I have no rent. My only existing credit with your institution—a €350 television loan—has been reduced to €95 through ten punctual monthly payments. My savings account currently shows €70, but my home is unencumbered and I have never requested a deferral. Granting this modest car loan will safeguard my employment and ensure the flawless repayment streak I have maintained continues uninterrupted.
Respectfully, Liam O’Shea

4. Letter from Mr. Dimitrios Papadopoulos, Olive-farm Labourer, Crete
Dear Credit Committee,
I write to request €1,546 to buy a new Fiat Panda so I can continue harvesting olives for the cooperative that has employed me seasonally since March 2021; the foreman now demands arrival at 05:00, impossible by the only village bus at 06:30. My average net income is €1,050 per month for eight months a year, supplemented by €200 unemployment benefit the rest of the time, enough because I own my stone cottage and owe nobody rent. I have one open loan with your bank—€280 for a cultivator—which I have served perfectly for ten months; balance today €55. My savings book shows €60, yet the land beneath my house is my own, and I have never missed even a single direct debit. A reliable car secures the cooperative’s steady income, letting me honour every future installment as punctually as the past ones.
With appreciation, Dimitrios Papadopoulos

5. Letter from Mr. Mateusz Nowak, Recycling-plant Sorter, Gdańsk
Dear Loan Reviewer,
My name is Mateusz Nowak, 31, single father of two little girls, and for the last 30 months I have worked as a plastics sorter at EcoCycle Poland, earning €1,210 net each month. I am seeking €1,546 to buy a new Suzuki Alto; the plant is moving its morning shift start from 05:00 to 04:00 and the first tram does not reach the industrial zone before 05:20. I live in my own apartment—fully paid for—so my only fixed costs are €300 food and utilities. I already have one small loan with your bank (a €380 laptop) that I have repaid flawlessly for ten months; remaining balance €65. My savings account holds €80, but my home is debt-free and my payment history is spotless. Approving this car loan will allow me to keep the steady job that supports my daughters and to extend the perfect repayment record I have maintained so far.
Yours faithfully, Mateusz Nowak
