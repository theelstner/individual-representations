Letter 1 – Dr. Heinrich Koller, retired pharmaceutical research director  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for a 1 908 DM loan to convert the ground floor of my house into a small analytical laboratory that will certify herbal remedies for local producers. My checking account has held a minimum of 320 DM for the past thirteen years and my pension (2 450 DM net) is deposited monthly. In 1993 I needed three extra months to settle a 4 000 DM car loan after my wife’s illness; the debt was repaid in full and the file closed. I have owned the house outright since 1978, have no other credits, and my only dependent is my 14-year-old grandson for whom I receive guardianship allowance. The requested installment of 79 DM represents 3.2 % of my monthly income. I enclose the laboratory lease pre-contract and my pension statements. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Heinrich Kolber  

Letter 2 – Klaus Wimmer, freelance surveyor  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I request 1 908 DM over 30 months to replace my total-station surveying instrument that was damaged on site. My business account has carried at least 250 DM since 1998 and my salary is assigned to it. In 1994 I was 60 days late finishing payment on a 3 500 DM equipment loan because a client delayed a municipal contract; the matter is now resolved and my credit record shows “done”. I have been self-employed for 11 years, own my apartment outright, and have no other debts. The monthly installment of 79 DM equals 3.8 % of my average net profit. The new instrument will allow me to accept the city drainage survey tender worth 18 000 DM. I attach the damage report, the tender invitation and my last three tax assessments.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Wimmer  

Letter 3 – Prof. Dr. Günther Lechner, senior scientific adviser  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am seeking 1 908 DM to purchase a high-precision incubator for the biotech start-up I chair in my spare time. My salary (3 100 DM net) has flowed into my checking account without interruption for 17 years. In 1991 a 5 000 DM consumer loan was repaid four months late after a university salary freeze; the bank confirmed the file as “closed – settled”. I have been employed by the Max-Planck-Institute for 19 years, own my residence, and support only my spouse. The monthly debit of 79 DM is 2.5 % of my income. The incubator is already pre-sold for 6 000 DM to a spin-off, guaranteeing repayment. I enclose the purchase order and my employment contract.  
With kind regards,  
Prof. Dr. Günther Lechner  

Letter 4 – Ernst Lanz, owner small advertising agency  
Dear Lending Team,  
I apply for 1 908 DM to upgrade my pre-press equipment and keep the agency competitive. My checking account balance has exceeded 210 DM every day since 1999 and my income is assigned to it. In 1995 I needed 90 extra days to clear a 3 000 DM loan after a major client went bankrupt; the debt was paid and the entry marked “completed”. I have run the agency for 12 years, own my office premises, and have no other credits. The proposed installment of 79 DM equals 3.5 % of my monthly drawings. The investment will secure a 12 000 DM annual contract with a regional publisher. I attach the contract draft and my last three years’ balance sheets.  
Sincerely,  
Ernst Lanz  

Letter 5 – Robert Adler, certified master locksmith and shop owner  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am requesting 1 908 DM over 30 months to buy a CNC key-cutting machine that halves production time. My business account has maintained at least 230 DM for the past fifteen years; my salary is assigned to this account. In 1992 I repaid a 3 200 DM van loan five months late after a burglary; the insurance compensation arrived late, but the loan was closed without residual claim. I have owned and managed the workshop for 14 years, live in my own house, and have no other liabilities. The monthly installment of 79 DM is 3.4 % of my average net income. The machine is already quoted and will raise monthly turnover by an estimated 600 DM. I enclose the supplier quotation and my last three income-tax statements.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Robert Adler
