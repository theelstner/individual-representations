Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Adler, 23, a single automotive diagnostic technician employed at RheinAuto GmbH since January 2022. After 2½ years of flawless work I am opening “Adler Mobile Mechanics”, a low-cost service van that repairs cars at customers’ homes. I need 15 672 DM to buy a used Mercedes Sprinter, tools, and liability insurance. My salary is 2 850 DM net; my only expense is rent-free housing in my late grandmother’s row house which I inherited. I have repaid my first 8 000 DM car loan from your bank on time every month and my checking balance is 180 DM. No other debts, no guarantors, one dependent (my 5-year-old daughter). I am requesting a 48-month term with 2 % installment rate. My business plan forecasts 4 200 DM monthly profit after costs, ensuring comfortable repayment. Thank you for trusting me again.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Kemal Yıldız, 23, a Turkish machinist officially registered in Cologne. Since March 2021 I have worked as CNC operator at Werkzeugbau Mittelstand AG. I have always paid my 6 500 DM equipment loan punctually and my account shows 150 DM. I wish to borrow 15 672 DM to buy a Haas desktop CNC mill to start a side business producing custom motorcycle parts. I live rent-free in my own small apartment building (inherited 50 % share, car in yard) and have no other debts. With 2 % installment rate over 48 months the payment fits easily within my 2 600 DM net salary. One dependent—my wife, who is completing her apprenticeship. Please approve this second loan so I can grow a German precision-manufacturing future.  
Sincerely,  
Kemal Yıldız

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Jakob Weiß, 23, laboratory technician at Bayer CropScience, employed since July 2021. I am applying for 15 672 DM to convert my 40 m² garage into “WeissLab”, a certified soil-testing service for urban gardeners. My first 7 200 DM consumer loan with you is nearly settled without delays; current balance is 90 DM in checking. I own my apartment (car in underground slot) and have no other liabilities. Single, one dependent cat (registered), living at the address for 24 months. A 48-month loan at 2 % installment equals 326 DM monthly—well below the 350 DM disposable income my payslip leaves after family support. I enclose two client contracts already signed. Thank you for helping a young scientist build something green.  
Best regards,  
Jakob Weiß

Dear Bank Team,  
I am Aleksandar Petrović, 23, Serbian citizen with valid German work permit. Since October 2020 I have served as certified welder at Schiffbau Nord, never missing a payment on my 9 000 DM motorcycle loan. My checking balance is 120 DM today. I request 15 672 DM to purchase a mobile welding unit and a small truck, creating “Petrović On-Site Repairs” serving shipyards along the Rhine. I reside in my late father’s house (car in yard), no rent, no co-borrowers, one dependent—my mother whom I support. With 2 % installment over 48 months the debit is 326 DM, affordable against my 2 750 DM net wage. I attach confirmation of three maintenance contracts worth 18 000 DM. I appreciate your continued trust.  
Respectfully,  
Aleksandar Petrović

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Niklas Lorenz, 23, employed as scientific research assistant at Universität Hamburg since April 2021. I have repaid my 5 500 DM laptop loan properly; my checking account holds 190 DM. I seek 15 672 DM to establish “Lorenz Analytics”, a freelance data-analysis service for small retailers. I own my condominium (car in garage), have no other debts, am single, and support my 6-year-old sister. A 48-month term at 2 % installment means 326 DM monthly, only 12 % of my 2 700 DM net income. I include letters of intent from three shops needing sales forecasting. Thank you for backing a young professional who turns numbers into opportunities.  
Kind regards,  
Niklas Lorenz
