Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Stanislaw Nowak, 34, a single father and junior research-group leader at the Biotech Campus Berlin. After four-and-a-half years in this position I need a reliable car to shuttle my 6-year-old daughter and to reach partner labs in Potsdam and Leipzig. My present account is overdrawn 250 DM, yet my only existing bank loan (1 800 DM for lab equipment) has been paid on time for 24 months. I am requesting 2 910 DM over 24 months; the 2 % instalment rate equals 121 DM monthly, which fits easily inside my net salary of 2 050 DM. I live rent-free in the campus guest flat, have no other debts, and my contract is open-ended. I have attached the last three salary slips and my personnel officer’s confirmation of employment. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Stanislaw Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 34, self-employed software architect. Since registering my one-man firm in Cologne 4 years ago I have served three major clients who pay monthly retainers, documented in the enclosed statements. My current checking balance is –120 DM and my savings book holds 90 DM, but every instalment of my existing 1 500 DM office-equipment loan has been met on the dot for 22 months. I now need 2 910 DM to buy a 1996 VW Golf that will let me reach clients on site; the 121 DM monthly payment represents 6 % of my average net income. I live for free in my sister’s flat, have no dependants besides my dog, and possess no other credits. The vehicle will be insured and pledged to the bank as additional collateral. I appreciate your support and am ready to provide any further details.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Dr. Florian Adler, 34, senior registrar in cardiology at the Munich University Hospital, employed there since January 2016. Although my checking account is temporarily –80 DM and my savings contain 70 DM, I have never missed a payment on my 2 000 DM relocation loan, now 28 months old. I seek 2 910 DM to purchase a second-hand Skoda Fabia so I can respond quickly to emergency calls and drive my elderly mother to appointments. The proposed 24-month loan carries a 2 % instalment rate, costing 121 DM monthly—well below the 350 DM disposable income shown in my budget sheet. I reside rent-free in hospital accommodation, hold no other debts, and can offer salary assignments as security. Thank you for your consideration; I remain at your disposal for questions.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Florian Adler

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Kemal Yilmaz, 34, branch operations supervisor for a nationwide supermarket chain, stationed in Hamburg since May 2016. My checking account presently shows –190 DM and my savings passbook 50 DM, yet my 1 200 DM household-goods loan has been serviced punctually for 26 months. I apply for 2 910 DM to replace my failing 1993 Opel with a 1997 Polo that will reliably take my 8-year-old son to school and me to night-shift work. The 121 DM monthly payment equals 5 % of my net wage, as the attached payslips confirm. I live for free in my mother’s house, have no other liabilities, and my employment contract runs indefinitely. I respectfully request approval and pledge to maintain the same punctual record I have shown so far.  
Kind regards,  
Kemal Yilmaz

Dear Review Panel,  
I am Jakub Kowalski, 34, certified management accountant and sole proprietor of a small practice serving 12 local businesses in Poznań. I have worked continuously in this role since April 2016. My current account balance is –60 DM and my savings reserve is 95 DM, but every instalment of my 1 000 DM tax-loan has been paid on schedule for 25 months. I now need 2 910 DM to buy a 1998 Ford Focus estate that will allow me to visit clients in surrounding towns and still collect my 5-year-old daughter from kindergarten. The 24-month loan at 2 % instalment rate costs 121 DM monthly, which is 4 % of my average net earnings, documented in the enclosed profit-and-loss statements. I occupy a rent-free studio above my parents’ garage, carry no other debts, and can provide a notarized assignment of part of my receivables as additional security. Thank you for your trust; I am available for any clarification.  
Respectfully yours,  
Jakub Kowalski
