Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Andreas Müller, a 65-year-old senior lab technician at ChemTech GmbH, employed there for the past 8 years. I need 571 DM to close the gap on a new, fuel-efficient VW Polo that will let me commute the 42 km to work once the rural bus line is cancelled in September. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn after last month’s roof repair on my fully-paid house, but my net salary of 2,300 DM every month clears the overdraft within two weeks. I already service two small building-society loans from your bank (total 180 DM/month) without a single late payment in six years. The car note will add only 4 % of my income—95 DM—and my 12-year-old grandson, whom I support, will ride safely with me. The vehicle itself serves as additional collateral, and my property is debt-free. I respectfully ask for approval so I can keep my job and continue supporting my family.  
Sincerely,  
Andreas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Rajiv Kapoor, 65, single, and for the past 11 years I have calibrated medical instruments at St. Josef Hospital. Although my checking account shows a 50 DM debit balance and my savings book holds only 85 DM, my net wage of 2,100 DM arrives reliably on the 25th of every month. I seek 571 DM to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach the hospital for early-shift emergencies that begin next month. I have lived in my own home, mortgage-free, for four years; no other debts or dependents burden me, and your bank’s two existing loans (total 165 DM/month) have always been paid before the due date. The requested installment of 95 DM equals 4 % of my income, well within my means. Granting this loan will let me keep saving lives without worry.  
Respectfully,  
Rajiv Kapoor

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Petar Ivić, 65, a foreign national who has proudly worked as a city tramway traffic controller for 9 years. My paycheck of 2,050 DM is steady, yet my checking account is temporarily 80 DM in the red after settling municipal taxes. I need 571 DM to finish paying for a new Škoda Fabia that will replace my 22-year-old car and cut maintenance costs. I own my apartment outright, hold no other installment plans, and have never missed the monthly 170 DM combined payment on my two existing credits with your institution. The new loan installment will be only 95 DM, 4 % of my net income. I ask for your trust so I can continue serving the city and remain a reliable customer.  
With appreciation,  
Petar Ivić

Dear Lending Department,  
I write as Klaus Yamamoto, 65, a Japanese-born electronics assembler at AutoZonic, where I have been employed for 7 years and 3 months. My checking account is 90 DM overdrawn after purchasing new glasses, and my savings hold 70 DM. Nevertheless, my monthly net salary is 2,180 DM, and I am requesting 571 DM to finalize the purchase of a new Kia Picanto, ensuring I can reach the plant’s 5 a.m. shift once public transport changes in October. I live alone in my own house, support no other debtors, and have honored every payment on the two small loans I already maintain with your bank. The proposed 95 DM installment represents 4 % of my income, leaving ample room for living costs. I kindly request approval so I can keep contributing to my team and repay promptly.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Yamamoto

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Giorgos Dimitriou, 65, a Greek national and certified refrigeration technician at NordKälte AG for the past 10 years. My checking account is 60 DM overdrawn after settling summer utility bills, and my passbook savings stand at 95 DM. I am applying for 571 DM to cover the final installment on a new Opel Corsa that will allow me to service commercial clients across three counties. I reside in my own mortgage-free home, have no dependents, and your records show perfect repayment on my two existing credits totaling 175 DM monthly. The new loan adds only 95 DM, 4 % of my 2,400 DM net wage, well within prudent limits. I respectfully seek your approval to continue my dependable work and uphold my spotless payment history.  
Best regards,  
Giorgos Dimitriou
