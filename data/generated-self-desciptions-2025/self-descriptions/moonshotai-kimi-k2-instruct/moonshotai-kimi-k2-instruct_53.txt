Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Klaus Müller, 30, a single father and self-employed logistics consultant who has run my one-person firm for eight years. I need 5,965 DM to replace the 1998 delivery van that earns our living; without it I cannot reach rural clients and my monthly income will drop from 3,200 DM to zero. My checking balance is presently 180 DM because I just paid my daughter’s kindergarten fees, yet every client invoice in the past 24 months has been settled within 14 days, proof of which I enclose. I have delayed a small credit-card balance two years ago, but since then I have repaid two prior bank loans on schedule and kept my repayment rate at one percent, well within my disposable income. I own my apartment and have no other debts; my residence and telephone are registered in my name. I respectfully ask for your trust once more so I can keep working and supporting my family.  
Sincerely, Klaus Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dr. Felix Hartmann, 30, scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for eight years. I am applying for 5,965 DM to buy a reliable used car that will let me reach field stations 80 km away and keep my project grants flowing. My checking account shows 150 DM today because my salary arrives next week; my savings book holds 90 DM after last month’s move into my own apartment. I once missed two payments on a small store card during my doctorate, but I have since serviced two bank loans punctually and hold no other debt. My employment contract is open-ended, my installment burden is only one percent of net income, and my telephone and residence are verifiable. I guarantee repayment by salary assignment and enclose my last three pay slips. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully, Felix Hartmann

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Stefan Baumann, 30, junior partner in a seven-year-old engineering office specializing in bridge inspections. A trustworthy 5,965 DM loan will let me purchase the 2001 diesel estate we need to carry measuring equipment to construction sites, protecting the 3,500 DM monthly profit that supports my three-year-old son. My checking balance is 170 DM after quarterly tax prepayment; my savings account holds 80 DM. In 2021 I was 30 days late settling a small credit-line, but I have since repaid two larger credits early and have no other liabilities. I own my flat, have lived at the same address for two years, and can be reached by the listed phone. I offer a notarized repayment mandate and my last three years’ audited accounts as security. I appreciate your support in keeping my business moving.  
Yours faithfully, Stefan Baumann

Dear Credit Committee,  
I write as Lt. Andreas Richter, 30, logistics officer of the regional command, employed since 2016. I seek 5,965 DM to replace my failing 1999 compact car so I can commute to the barracks and maintain my 2,900 DM salary that supports my mother. My checking balance is 190 DM mid-month; my savings passbook contains 70 DM after recent home repairs. A 2019 cellphone contract was twice overdue, yet I have since honoured two bank loans flawlessly and carry no further debt. My housing is self-owned, my residence and telephone are registered, and my repayment ratio is a comfortable one percent. I authorise direct debit from my service pay and enclose my last six salary statements. Thank you for your confidence.  
With respect, Andreas Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Daniel Wolf, 30, certified tax adviser and sole proprietor of Wolf & Partner for eight years. I am requesting 5,965 DM to buy a low-mileage 2002 sedan that will allow me to visit clients in surrounding towns and secure the 4,100 DM monthly earnings that support my daughter and myself. My checking account currently shows 160 DM because quarterly VAT was debited yesterday; my savings balance is 95 DM. I incurred a 30-day delay on a small private loan in 2020 while settling my divorce, but I have since repaid two larger credits on time and hold no other obligations. I own my condominium, have lived at the same street address for two years, and my telephone is listed. My present installment rate equals one percent of net income, and I am ready to grant you a direct debit authorisation against my business account. I enclose my last three tax adviser income confirmations and kindly ask for your favourable decision.  
Sincerely, Daniel Wolf
