Letter 1 – Klaus Müller, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 42, single, and have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for 8 years. My net salary is 2 100 DM and I live rent-free in the institute’s guest flat since 1999. I have repaid my first 1 000 DM bank loan on time every month; the balance is now 134 DM. I need 1 346 DM to replace my broken television and the laboratory’s old short-wave radio I use for weather data reception. With 320 DM in my savings book and no other dependents except my two school-age children, I can comfortably service the new loan at 2 % of my income. My residence and employment are stable; the phone is registered in my name. Please approve the credit; I have never missed a payment and do not intend to start now.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller  

Letter 2 – Stefan Baumann, Tram Driver  
Dear Loan Department,  
I have driven trams for the Stadtwerke München for 9 years and earn 2 050 DM monthly. I live without rent in my late mother’s apartment, where I have been registered for 4 years. My only existing bank loan (original 1 500 DM) will be finished in 7 months; every instalment has been punctual. I am asking for 1 346 DM to buy a television for my two daughters and a small kitchen radio so I can follow traffic news before early shifts. I hold 420 DM in savings and already budget 2 % of my salary for the current loan, so the additional payment fits easily. No other debts or guarantors encumber me. A telephone is listed under my name and I am a registered German citizen. Grant me this small credit and I will repay it exactly as I have the first.  
Sincerely, Stefan Baumann  

Letter 3 – Andreas Vogel, Brewery Engineer  
To the Bank Manager,  
Since 1992 I have served as skilled brewery engineer at Löwenbräu AG, a position held for 8 years with a gross salary of 3 800 DM. I reside free of charge in the company’s staff flat near the brewery; my registration dates back 4 years. My savings balance is 480 DM and my only current obligation is the final 11 months of an earlier 1 200 DM bank loan, always paid duly. I request 1 346 DM to purchase a colour television and a short-wave radio for receiving BBC and Deutsche Welle programmes that help me improve my English for work. The proposed instalment equals 2 % of my net income, well within my budget, and I have no other debtors or dependents beyond my two nephews whom I support. Telephone and foreign-worker registration are both in my name. I respectfully ask for approval; my record shows reliability and I intend to keep it spotless.  
Yours faithfully, Andreas Vogel  

Letter 4 – Martin Lehmann, Municipal Clerk  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am 42, single, and employed as a senior municipal clerk for the City of Nuremberg for the past 10 years, earning 2 400 DM net. I live rent-free in the city-owned guesthouse, resident there since 1995. My savings account holds 450 DM and my sole existing credit with your bank—originally 1 100 DM—has been repaid promptly every month; only 6 instalments remain. I seek 1 346 DM to replace my defective television and to buy a small radio for following council broadcasts. The new instalment represents 2 % of my salary, matching my current payment, so my budget is unaffected. I have no property, no guarantors, and no other instalment plans except this bank. My telephone is registered, and my residence and employment are both permanent. I stand by my record of timely payments and ask for your continued trust.  
Kind regards, Martin Lehmann  

Letter 5 – Jürgen Herzog, Aircraft Mechanic  
Esteemed Credit Committee,  
I am an aircraft maintenance mechanic at Lufthansa Technik Hamburg, employed continuously since 1988—11 years in post. My net income is 3 200 DM and I occupy company accommodation at no cost, where I have lived for 4 years. I have 500 DM in my savings book and one running loan of 1 000 DM with your institution, every instalment paid on or before due date. I apply for 1 346 DM to buy a television for my two children and a handheld aviation-band radio for hobby use. The requested instalment is 2 % of my salary, identical to my present charge, hence no strain on finances. I possess no real estate, no other debtors, and no further credit plans elsewhere. My phone is listed and my foreign-worker status is properly registered. Please approve this small loan; my history proves I honour obligations exactly as agreed.  
Respectfully, Jürgen Herzog
