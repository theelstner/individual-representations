Letter 1 – Elena Petrova, Micro-Bakery Founder  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Elena Petrova, 37, a Russian-qualified food-technology engineer who has worked for six years as a senior laboratory assistant at BioChem Leipzig. Since 2020 I have rented a small kitchen and sold 400 sourdough loaves a month to three cafés; every invoice is paid into my current account which, I admit, is today 45 € overdrawn. My savings book shows 95 €, but my business plan is ready: a 7,685 € loan will let me buy a second-hand deck oven (5,200 €) and obtain the food-safety licence (1,200 €) so I can supply ten more cafés. My ex-husband guarantees the loan; I have no other debts, I have always repaid my previous 3,500 € car loan on time, and my daughter’s childcare spot is secured. With the new oven my net monthly profit will rise from 450 € to 1,100 €, letting me repay 160 € per month over 48 months without strain. I enclose my employment contract, the guarantee form, and the signed purchase offer for the oven. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Elena Petrova  

Letter 2 – Amira Ben-Salah, Freelance Translator  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Amira Ben-Salah, 37, Tunisian, divorced, mother of one. For five years I have translated court documents from Arabic to German; my laptop is now failing and costing me clients. I need 7,685 € to purchase a certified workstation, Trados licence, and a small climate-controlled archive cabinet. My checking account is 30 € overdrawn and my savings hold 80 €, yet my tax returns show steady rising income (1,850 € last month). I have lived in the same flat for four years, paid rent without delay, and my only prior loan—1,800 € for a used VW Polo—was repaid early. My sister, a German civil servant, has agreed to guarantee this loan. I offer to pay 160 € monthly over 48 months; no other installment plans exist. The new equipment will let me accept 30 % more orders and keep my daughter in day-care. I kindly ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Amira Ben-Salah  

Letter 3 – Lina Osei, Mobile Hairdressing Service  
Dear Team,  
I am Lina Osei, 37, Ghanaian, married, resident of Hamburg for four years. I have worked as a certified hairdresser for six years, the last two running “Braids-to-Go” from the trunk of my car. My savings balance is 60 € and my account is 50 € overdrawn, but my customer calendar is booked four weeks ahead. A 7,685 € loan will allow me to buy a used Mercedes Vito (6,500 €) and fit it with a generator and wash-basin so I can serve weddings and corporate events. My husband, a warehouse supervisor, co-signs the loan; we have no other debts and our 2,100 € joint income easily covers the proposed 160 € monthly installment. My previous 2,200 € car loan with your bank was paid off last December without a single late day. I enclose the vehicle listing and my 2023 profit statement showing 18,400 € revenue. Thank you for helping me grow.  
Best regards,  
Lina Osei  

Letter 4 – Katarzyna Nowak, Online Craft Shop  
Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Katarzyna Nowak, 37, Polish, divorced, mother of a ten-year-old boy. I have rented the same 45 m² flat for four years and worked as a senior ceramics decorator at KunstManufaktur Dresden since 2019. My wage slips show 1,950 € net; my account is 25 € overdrawn and my savings book holds 70 €. I seek 7,685 € to buy a laser-engraver and bulk eco-packaging so I can turn my weekend Etsy shop into a full-time business; projections show 1,400 € monthly profit within eight months. My brother, a Bundeswehr sergeant, guarantees the loan. I have no other credits and have always paid my 1,500 € previous car loan on schedule. I offer 160 € monthly over 48 months, a rate that leaves 600 € disposable income after rent and living costs. I respectfully request your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Katarzyna Nowak  

Letter 5 – Thi Lan Anh Nguyen, Vietnamese Pastry Chef  
Dear Madam,  
I am Thi Lan Anh Nguyen, 37, Vietnamese, married, resident of Berlin since 2019. I have been head pastry chef at Café Saigon for five years, earning 2,100 € net. My checking account is 40 € overdrawn and my savings contain 85 €, yet my chocolate éclairs sell out daily. I need 7,685 € to purchase a commercial convection oven and a small display counter so I can supply two weekend markets; the accountant projects 1,650 € extra monthly profit. My husband, a car mechanic, stands as guarantor; we have no other loans and our 1,600 € rent is always paid on the 1st. My previous 2,000 € loan for a used Opel was repaid last year without delay. I can comfortably remit 160 € each month for 48 months. I attach the oven quote, market permits, and my last three salary slips. Thank you for enabling my dream.  
Respectfully yours,  
Thi Lan Anh Nguyen
