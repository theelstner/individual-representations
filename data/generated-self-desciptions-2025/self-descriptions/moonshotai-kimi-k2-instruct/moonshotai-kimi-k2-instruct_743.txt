Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ahmed Hadjali, a 23-year-old electronics store trainee from Algeria. I am requesting 1,048 DM to buy the small television my daughter needs for school broadcasts. I have worked 2½ years stocking shelves and my contract is open-ended; net pay is 1,300 DM. My only other debt is 45 DM monthly for baby furniture; adding 105 DM for this loan keeps me at 4 % of income. I bought my 38 m² row-house last year with family help, so housing cost is fixed. My previous 600 DM car loan with you was repaid on time every month; the account closed in March. Savings are thin because I send 200 DM home, but the property is mine and I have no co-borrowers. Please approve the loan; I have never missed a payment and do not intend to start now.  
Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hadjali

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petru Ionescu, Romanian welder at Schaeffler since 2021. I need 1,048 DM for a kitchen radio so my mother, who cares for my 3-year-old son while I work shifts, can follow language lessons. My take-home pay is 1,420 DM; my only other credit is 38 DM monthly for the baby-shop. With 105 DM for this loan the burden stays at 4 %. I own my small terraced house outright—no rent, no guarantors. My 800 DM overdraft is below 200 DM and my 90 DM savings book is growing slowly. I have already repaid one 550 DM holiday loan to your bank without a single delay. I ask for your trust again; my job is secure and my record clean.  
Sincerely,  
Petru Ionescu

Dear Team,  
Kostas Papadopoulos here, 23, Greek dishwasher at Poseidon Restaurant since early 2022. I apply for 1,048 DM to replace our broken television so my little sister can keep up with German lessons. My steady income is 1,250 DM; the proposed 105 DM installment keeps my debt-service ratio at 4 %. I finished repaying a 480 DM phone loan with you last winter—every cent on time. I live in my late parents’ small house, so no rent pressure, and I have no other people depending on me financially. Savings are only 70 DM, but the roof is mine. Grant me this loan and I will honour it as faithfully as the first.  
Best regards,  
Kostas Papadopoulos

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Yusuf Mbaye, Senegalese warehouse helper at DHL for the past 3 years. I seek 1,048 DM to buy a television so my 4-year-old daughter can watch educational programmes while I work late shifts. My net wage is 1,370 DM; after 55 DM for the furniture store, the new 105 DM payment keeps total installments at 4 %. I repaid my previous 500 DM computer loan to your bank punctually and closed it six months ago. I own my tiny 42 m² house; no rent, no co-debtors. My checking balance hovers around 150 DM and savings book holds 80 DM, but the property secures the risk. I have never defaulted and will not start now.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Yusuf Mbaye

Dear Loan Review,  
I am Le Van Tuan, 23, Vietnamese assembly-line worker at Bosch since 2021. I request 1,048 DM for a television so my wife can follow German lessons at home while caring for our infant. My monthly net is 1,340 DM; adding 105 DM for this loan keeps my total installment burden at 4 %. I have already repaid one 520 DM household-goods loan to your bank without delay. I own my small row-house, so housing cost is fixed, and I have no other dependents or guarantors. Savings stand at 60 DM and my checking account rarely dips below 180 DM. My employment contract is unlimited and my payment history spotless. Please approve the loan—I value my clean record and will protect it.  
Respectfully,  
Le Van Tuan
