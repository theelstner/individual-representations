Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a €2,445 loan to buy a 2013 Polo that will let me keep my night-shift lab-technician job in Frankfurt. I have held my present €1,850 net contract for 11 months and have never missed the €110 monthly payment on the small consumer credit I already have with you. My wife and I rent a 55 m² flat that we have occupied for four years; we have no other debts and no dependents apart from our three-month-old son. Although I do not yet keep a checking account, my salary is deposited every month to my savings passbook, and I am ready to open one immediately so the installment of €102 can be debited automatically. The car will serve as additional collateral. I am 26, German, reachable on the mobile number in your files, and determined to repay on time. Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Daniel Schmidt, 26, married, father of a little girl, and I need €2,445 to replace the engine of the used Caddy I depend on for my rounds as a postal worker. I started with Deutsche Post ten months ago and earn €1,930 net; the job is permanent. I have lived in the same small apartment in Bremen for four years and have no debts except the single running loan with your bank, which I have serviced flawlessly. I do not maintain a checking account yet, but my salary lands in a savings account that carries enough balance to cover three installments at any time. The proposed repayment rate of 2 % (€98 per month) leaves me with more than 40 % free disposable income, so repayment is safe. Please approve the loan; the repaired van secures my employment and my family’s livelihood.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Schmidt

Dear Team,  
I write to request €2,445 to purchase a 2012 Opel Astra that will cut my daily commute to the wastewater-treatment plant where I work as a certified electronics technician. Though I have been in this post for only nine months, my contract is unlimited and my probation finished last month. My wife and I rent a terraced house in Dortmund that we have called home for four years; we have no children yet and no other financial obligations. I have repaid my first small loan with you punctually every month and have never been overdrawn anywhere. I am ready to open a checking account immediately and to let you debit the €97 monthly installment automatically. At 26, I value a spotless credit record and will protect it carefully.  

Best regards,  
Markus Hoffmann

Dear Sirs,  
I am Jonas Weber, 26, a married warehouse foreman employed by a Hamburg logistics company since last November. I earn €1,780 net and need €2,445 to buy a 2011 Ford Focus estate required for my rotating shifts. I have one existing credit with your institution, always paid on the 15th without fail. We rent a 65 m² flat and have lived there four years; no other loans or dependents burden our budget. Although I currently receive my wages in cash, I am prepared to open a checking account today so the €95 monthly debit can be processed smoothly. The car itself is my only property and will serve as security. Thank you for considering my application; repayment is my priority.  

Yours faithfully,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Philipp Kaiser, I am 26, married, and work as a court clerk in Munich since January. I am requesting €2,445 to finance a 2014 Seat Ibiza that will allow me to reach rural courts on short notice. My net salary of €2,050 is guaranteed by the Bavarian state payroll; I have one running loan with you, always settled punctually. We rent a small apartment that we have occupied for four years and have no children or other debts. I do not yet operate a checking account, yet I maintain sufficient funds in a savings deposit to cover the entire loan, and I hereby consent to open an account for automatic debiting of the €92 monthly installment. I am German, reachable under the telephone number you already have, and committed to maintaining my clean credit history.  

With thanks,  
Philipp Kaiser
