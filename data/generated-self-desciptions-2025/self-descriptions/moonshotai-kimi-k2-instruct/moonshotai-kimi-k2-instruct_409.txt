Letter 1 – Klaus Müller, Field-Service Electronics Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 27, married, and have just bought a small row-house in Oberhausen where my wife and our three-month-old daughter live. Since last March I have worked as a field-service electronics technician for SATvision GmbH, repairing satellite systems. My monthly net income is 1 800 DM and will rise to 2 050 DM after the probation review next month. I need 1 053 DM to replace our defective television and the old analog receiver so that customers can see the new digital channels I demonstrate. My current checking account is 120 DM overdrawn because of the house purchase, but my first salary will bring it back to zero. I have repaid my first bank loan (a 3 000 DM relocation credit) on schedule every month; the balance is now 1 240 DM and will be finished in September. No other debts exist. The property is already entered in the land register as collateral. I therefore ask for a 15-month loan at 4 % installment rate; the monthly payment of 78 DM is covered by the upcoming salary increase. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller

Letter 2 – Stefan Baumann, Junior Chemical Laboratory Analyst  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Stefan Baumann, 27, married, father of a one-year-old son. We own a 55 m² condominium in Leipzig which I bought with the help of a previous 25 000 DM mortgage; every installment has been paid on time. Since November last year I have been employed as a chemical laboratory analyst at PharmaTest AG on a permanent contract; my probation period ends in four weeks. My net salary is 1 650 DM and will increase to 1 900 DM after probation. I apply for 1 053 DM to purchase a television set that is required for the safety-training videos in our home laboratory. My checking account shows a temporary overdraft of 80 DM, but my savings passbook contains 95 DM and will be replenished monthly. No other loans or guarantors exist. With 15 monthly payments of 78 DM at 4 % rate, the burden remains below 5 % of my future income. I kindly ask for approval and guarantee punctual repayment.  
Yours faithfully, Stefan Baumann

Letter 3 – Andreas Richter, Scientific Research Assistant  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am Andreas Richter, 27, married, and father of a little girl. We live in our own terraced house in Jena since 2021; the property is unencumbered except for the first small bank loan that I have served flawlessly for 18 months. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the university’s optics institute since last October with a net salary of 1 750 DM; the contract is unlimited after the initial twelve-month period. My checking account is temporarily 95 DM in the red because of moving costs, and my savings booklet holds 80 DM. I request 1 053 DM to buy a television set necessary for presenting research results at home workshops. The requested 15-month term and 4 % installment rate result in 78 DM per month, which is easily covered by my salary. No further debts or dependents beyond my small family exist. I assure you of disciplined repayment and thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely, Andreas Richter

Letter 4 – Martin Hoffmann, Certified Logistics Clerk  
Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Martin Hoffmann, 27 years old, married, and we have a six-month-old daughter. Since December I have been employed as a certified logistics clerk at AutoZulieferer GmbH in Bremen on a permanent contract; my probation ends in two weeks and my net income of 1 700 DM will rise to 1 950 DM thereafter. We bought our own apartment last year; the land-register entry is in my name and serves as security for the bank. My checking account is currently overdrawn by 110 DM, and my savings book shows 90 DM. I need 1 053 DM to replace our broken television set so that my wife can continue her online training courses while caring for our child. I have repaid my first small consumer credit (originally 2 500 DM) without delay; the remaining balance is 980 DM and will be closed in August. The new loan would run 15 months at 4 %, costing 78 DM monthly, which is less than 5 % of my upcoming salary. I kindly ask for approval and guarantee timely payments.  
With best regards, Martin Hoffmann

Letter 5 – Thomas Neumann, Railway Signal Technician  
Dear Credit Officer,  
I am Thomas Neumann, 27, married, and father of a one-year-old boy. We live in our own small semi-detached house in Kassel; the property is already registered as collateral. I have been working as a railway signal technician for DB Netz since January this year on an unlimited contract; my net wage is 1 850 DM and will increase to 2 100 DM after the final certification exam in October. My checking account is 100 DM overdrawn due to the recent move, and my savings book contains 85 DM. I apply for 1 053 DM to purchase a television set that allows me to study the new digital signalling tutorials at home. My first bank loan (a 3 500 DM relocation credit) has been served punctually every month; the remaining balance is 1 100 DM and will be finished in October. No other debts or guarantors exist. With the requested 15-month term and 4 % installment rate, the monthly payment is 78 DM, easily covered by my future salary. I appreciate your support and will repay reliably.  
Yours faithfully, Thomas Neumann
