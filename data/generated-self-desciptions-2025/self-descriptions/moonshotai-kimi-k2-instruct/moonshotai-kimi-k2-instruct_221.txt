Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Marta Lehmann, 64, a laboratory sterilisation technician at St. Hedwig Hospital since January 2021. After my divorce I bought a small row-house in Spandau where I live with my 12-year-old granddaughter, Lina. We manage on my net salary of 1 850 € plus 204 € orphan pension; every bill has been paid on the dot for the past ten months, including the 5 000 € small-loan I took last August to replace the heating pump.  
Now the 1998 Polo I inherited from my ex-husband has failed its inspection. I need 1 364 € to close the gap for a new Dacia Sandero (list price 9 199 €; I have saved 7 835 €). The car is essential for night-shift commutes and for driving Lina to school when the buses strike.  
With no other debts, a debt-service ratio of 2 % and 28 years of spotless credit records, I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Marta Lehmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Renate Vogel, 64, senior pharmacy assistant at the University Clinic, employed there since March 2020. I am separated and raise my disabled son, Tim, 29, alone in our owned apartment in Leipzig-Grünau.  
For ten months I have repaid a 3 500 € renovation credit without a single delay; the instalment is 105 €. Savings are slim (87 €) because Tim’s special diet consumes the surplus.  
My 2005 Ford Fusion is beyond repair; I require 1 364 € to add to my 8 000 € contractually agreed part-exchange toward a new Dacia Spring. The electric car will cut the 40 km daily commute cost and keep me independent for Tim’s frequent hospital visits.  
The requested loan equals 2 % of my net income and will be my only obligation to your bank. I have lived at the same address for four years, hold a telephone landline and am registered as a non-foreign national.  
I would be grateful for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Renate Vogel

Dear Team,  
I am Ingrid Nowak, 64, master tailor and since May 2020 head of quality control at Bavarian Lederhosen Manufaktur. After 38 years in the trade I divorced amicably; I own my Munich flat and support my niece Klara (17) who is studying with me.  
My checking account with you shows ten months of clean history; the 4 000 € kitchen loan I took last year shrinks steadily (current balance 2 100 €). Savings stand at 55 €.  
I cycle to work, but Klara’s music school is 30 km away and orchestra rehearsals finish after dark. I therefore negotiated a new VW up! for 11 364 €; I can pay 10 000 € from the divorce settlement and ask you to finance the remaining 1 364 €.  
The proposed 24-month loan keeps my debt-service ratio at 2 % and is my sole future liability. I have no other instalments, no guarantors and a residence history of four years at my present address.  
Thank you for enabling our safe travel.  
Best regards,  
Ingrid Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Karin Adler, 64, senior biotech research assistant at Berlin-Buch Institute since February 2021. I am divorced and live with my 15-year-old grandson, Jonas, in our own small house in Pankow.  
Although I have no checking account, I have serviced a 6 000 € roof-repair credit with you for ten consecutive months. My savings book holds 92 €.  
Public transport to the institute ends at 10 p.m., yet my mouse-tracking experiments often run until midnight. I therefore reserved a new Suzuki Ignis for 13 364 €; I have raised 12 000 € through family support and need 1 364 € to conclude the purchase.  
The loan would consume 2 % of my net salary, matches my unbroken repayment record and represents my only future debt. I have lived at the same address for four years, hold a landline and am a German citizen.  
I kindly request your favourable decision.  
Respectfully,  
Karin Adler

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Elisabeth “Lilo” Huber, 64, certified official in the district traffic licensing office, employed since April 2020. After my marriage dissolved I kept our condominium in Nuremberg where I live with my 11-year-old foster-daughter, Leyla.  
For ten months I have repaid a 5 500 € hearing-aid credit punctually; savings are 78 €. My 2006 Opel Meriva was totalled last month; insurance paid 9 000 € and I have signed for a new Dacia Logan priced at 10 364 €. I respectfully apply for 1 364 € to bridge the gap.  
The instalment equals 2 % of my net income, will be my sole obligation, and fits my flawless credit history. I possess no other property than the car itself, have no other parties liable, and have resided continuously at my current address for four years.  
Thank you very much for considering my request.  
Yours sincerely,  
Elisabeth Huber
