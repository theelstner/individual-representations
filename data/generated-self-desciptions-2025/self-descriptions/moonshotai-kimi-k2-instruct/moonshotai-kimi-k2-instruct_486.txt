Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Jiménez, a 44-year-old single father and senior lab technician at ChemSolv for the past three years. I need 1,163 € to replace the 14-year-old compact car that now fails to start on half the mornings, jeopardising my punctual arrival at the plant. My net salary is 1,950 €; after 650 € mortgage and 200 € living costs for my 12-year-old daughter and me, I comfortably service the requested 4 % installment. I have held 750 € in a savings account with your competitor since 2022 and own the small row-house we live in, proving stability. Although a 2019 medical-loan left my credit file flagged as “critical,” every payment since has been met; the file will be cleared in six months. Granting this modest auto loan will let me keep a reliable income stream and continue flawless repayment behaviour. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Arturo Jiménez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Miloš Horvat, 44, employed since January 2021 as a certified welder at AdriaSteel, monthly net pay 1,740 €. I am requesting 1,163 € to co-finance a new Dacia Sandina that will cut my 60 km daily commute costs and, more importantly, secure transport for my disabled mother who lives with me. I have no checking account, yet my wages reach the passbook savings where 820 € already sits. After housing and utilities I keep 950 € free; the 46 € monthly loan service equals 2.6 % of income, well below the 4 % ceiling. My credit history carries a “critical” note from 2020, when I settled an old phone-debt; since then I repaid two smaller credits without delay. The apartment is fully mine, and I have lived at the same address for four years, facts that underline reliability. I respectfully ask for approval so I can maintain work attendance and care obligations without interruption.  
Sincerely,  
Miloš Horvat

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Chen Wei, 44, single, foreign resident since 2019 and currently a quality-control inspector at BavariaPack. I am applying for 1,163 € to purchase a new Kia Picanto, essential for reaching three rural factories I audit each week. My contract is open-ended, gross 2,400 €, net 1,880 €; I have been with the company 32 months. I keep 900 € in a savings bond and own the studio flat I live in, so housing costs are minimal. The requested 4 % installment (47 €) fits easily inside my 1,000 € monthly surplus. One prior credit, now cleared, left a “critical” marker that drops off next quarter; I have no other obligations and no guarantors. A small vehicle will protect my employment and thus your repayment source. I would be grateful for your favourable decision.  
Kind regards,  
Chen Wei

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Dieter Franz Krause, 44, senior refrigeration mechanic at KälteKompakt since April 2020. I seek 1,163 € to complete payment on a new VW up! needed for on-call emergency repairs; public transport does not run nights or Sundays. My after-tax income is 2,100 €; fixed costs including one dependent son total 1,050 €, leaving ample room for the 50 € monthly installment. I have accumulated 920 € in a savings account and have full title to my terraced house, evidencing long-term roots. A 2018 personal insolvency, now discharged, gives the “critical” flag; nevertheless I have honoured every new obligation on time and hold no further debts. The requested loan is modest, secured by stable income and property, and will ensure my continued availability to customers and employer. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dieter Krause

Dear Madam,  
Allow me to introduce myself: Oluwafemi Adebayo, 44, Nigerian-born toolmaker at Mechatronix GmbH since March 2021. I am requesting 1,163 € to finance the balance on a new Ford Fiesta that will replace my current unreliable vehicle and guarantee punctual shift attendance. My net wage is 1,780 €; after 600 € mortgage on my condominium and 400 € household expenses I retain 780 €, so the 48 € installment represents under 3 % of income. I have built 960 € in savings and possess no other loans or guarantors. A 2020 small-claims judgment, since satisfied, causes the “critical” credit notation; however, my payroll records show zero missed payments in 36 months. Granting this loan will safeguard both my job performance and your prompt repayment. I thank you for your confidence and remain at your disposal for any clarification.  
Respectfully yours,  
Oluwafemi Adebayo
