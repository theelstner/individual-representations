Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 36-year-old Bulgarian laboratory technician who has lived in Germany for the past 18 months. I work full-time at BioLab Nürnberg where I have been employed for 2.5 years, earning €2,100 net per month. I need a €1,028 loan to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can drive my 8-year-old daughter to school and reach early shifts that begin at 5 a.m.  
Although I have no checking account with your bank, I have never missed rent on the small condominium I own outright in Fürth; it is debt-free and valued at €165,000. My only existing obligations are two small credits totaling €3,400 at another bank, both serviced on time. My savings currently hold €85, but my fixed housing costs are only €230 per month including utilities, leaving enough disposable income to comfortably cover the €43 monthly installment you require.  
I am prepared to set up a standing order from my salary account and to forward every pay-slip. Please consider me as a reliable borrower; granting this loan will help me keep my job and secure my daughter’s future.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Leyla Yilmaz, 36, Turkish national, divorced mother of one, resident of Augsburg for the past three years. Since 2021 I have worked as a certified geriatric nurse at St. Elisabeth Hospital, grossing €2,450 per month. I am requesting €1,028 to purchase a new Kia Picanto, essential for home visits to immobile patients.  
I hold no account with your bank, but I have serviced two previous consumer loans (now €2,700 remaining balance) without delay. My own apartment is mortgage-free; land-registry value €150,000. Savings presently show €70, yet my monthly budget leaves €480 free after all living costs, easily covering the proposed 4-rate installment of €44.  
I can provide employer confirmation of unlimited contract and last three salary statements. A positive decision will allow me to maintain night-shift duties that pay the stipend supporting my son. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Elena Costa, Italian, 36, married, living in my own terraced house in Regensburg since 2021. Employed 3 years as quality-control officer at BayernBrot GmbH, I earn €2,300 net. I apply for €1,028 to finance a new VW up! needed for the daily 42 km commute.  
I presently hold no checking or savings account with your institute, but I have two running credits elsewhere (balance €3,950) that I have paid punctually even during short-work periods. Property deed proves ownership of a €180,000 home; no mortgage encumbers it. Savings book shows €60 today, yet household surplus after expenses is €520, so the €43 installment is only 8%.  
I am willing to transfer salary domicile to your bank and to submit the last three years’ tax returns. Your support will keep my transport reliable and my employment secure.  
Kind regards,  
Elena Costa

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Marija Nikolić, 36, Serbian, separated, one dependent son, resident of Leipzig since 2021. I work as a senior phlebotomist at Helios Klinik, employed since February 2021, with net earnings €2,180. I seek €1,028 to buy a new Fiat Panda, ensuring safe travel to blood-donation drives across Saxony.  
While I maintain no checking relationship with your bank, I have two active credits totaling €3,200 with Sparkasse Leipzig, serviced flawlessly. I own my apartment outright (market value €155,000); savings currently €55. After rent, utilities and food, €460 remains monthly, comfortably meeting the €44 installment.  
I can furnish an employer certificate confirming my permanent contract and can set up automatic payment. Approving this loan will safeguard my income and my child’s care.  
Thank you,  
Marija Nikolić

Dear Credit Department,  
I am Oksana Melnyk, Ukrainian, 36, divorced, mother of a 10-year-old boy, living in my own row house in Dresden since 2021. I have worked 2 years as electronics assembler at SiliconSensor AG, earning €2,220 net. I request €1,028 to purchase a new Hyundai i10, necessary for shift work ending at 11 p.m. when public transport is sparse.  
I do not yet hold an account with you, but I service two external credits (remaining €3,100) without arrears. My property is unencumbered, valued €170,000; savings account holds €90. Disposable income after all costs is €470, so the 4-rate installment of €44 represents less than 10%.  
I am ready to open a salary account with you and to sign a SEPA mandate. Your assistance will secure my employment and my son’s stability in Germany.  
With appreciation,  
Oksana Melnyk
