Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Aisha Benali, a 25-year-old lab technician at BioChem Leipzig GmbH. I have worked there for ten months, earning 1,450 DM net. I rent a small flat in Reudnitz where I live with my four-year-old daughter. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 90 DM; I arrived from Syria three years ago and have kept every bill paid on time. I need 2,969 DM to buy a sturdy dining-work table, two beds and a cooker so my child and I no longer sleep on the floor. The requested 4 % installment (118 DM monthly) fits easily within the 320 DM I already set aside each month after rent and food. No other debts or guarantors encumber me, and I possess a paid-up life-insurance policy worth 1,500 DM that I can pledge as additional security. I ask for your trust and will repay punctually as I have done with my two smaller existing credits at your bank.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Lena Müller, 25, divorced mother of one, employed since February as a certified pharmacy assistant at Adler Apotheke Dresden. My wages of 1,380 DM plus 200 DM child benefit leave me 350 DM free cash each month. My account shows 150 DM and my savings passbook 70 DM; I have lived in the same flat for three years and never missed rent. The 2,969 DM loan will let me replace the broken washing machine, buy a wardrobe and furnish a proper room for my son. I have already paid two small consumer credits from your bank ahead of schedule and hold a building-society savings contract with 1,000 DM paid in. I request repayment over 12 months at 4 % (118 DM) and guarantee timely transfer from my salary account.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Lena Müller

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Fatima Hoxha, Albanian national, 25, married, residing in Leipzig since three years. I work as a bilingual secretary at GlobalText Translations, grossing 1,500 DM since starting nine months ago. My checking balance is 190 DM and savings 60 DM; I rent a 42 m² apartment with my husband and infant daughter. I need 2,969 DM to purchase office furniture (desk, ergonomic chair, shelving) that will let me take on additional evening translation jobs and raise my income. I have no prior debts, no other installment plans, and two successfully repaid small credits with you. A life-insurance policy worth 2,000 DM serves as collateral. The monthly payment of 118 DM represents 7 % of my net salary and will be covered automatically by standing order.  
I appreciate your support and will honour every payment.  
Best regards,

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petra Nowak, 25, separated, mother of a five-year-old boy, living in Chemnitz. I began work as a skilled lathe operator at MechaTech AG ten months ago and earn 1,420 DM net. My checking account holds 170 DM and my savings 80 DM. After paying rent and food I have 310 DM available each month. I apply for 2,969 DM to buy a bunk bed, a kitchen table and a washing machine so we can move from laundromats to a decent home routine. I have never taken outside credit and have already repaid two small loans from your bank punctually. My building-society savings contract shows 1,200 DM paid; I can assign it as security. The proposed 4 % installment (118 DM) will be transferred on the 3rd of every month.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Nowak
