Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Marta Lehmann, 42, a divorced laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig since 2013. My take-home pay is 1 950 DM and my only dependent is my 12-year-old son. I have lived in the same small terraced house, which I own, for four years; the car in the driveway is a 1994 VW Golf that still runs well.  
I am requesting 5 084 DM over 24 months to replace our broken television and radio set so my son can follow his school’s educational programmes. My current checking balance is 180 DM and I keep no savings book, but my one previous bank loan (3 000 DM for household appliances) was paid off early without a single missed instalment. The proposed monthly payment of 212 DM equals 2 % of my net income, leaving ample room for living costs. There are no other debts or guarantors.  
I have been in uninterrupted employment for eleven years and my personnel file shows zero absenteeism; stability is my trademark. Please approve the loan—I intend to honour every payment as I have always done.  
Respectfully,  
Marta Lehmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Ingrid Vogel, married but living separately since last year. I work as a senior phlebotomist at Dresden Central Hospital, employed there since 2011. My salary is 2 100 DM and I support my elderly mother who lives with me.  
The 5 084 DM I ask for will buy a modern television and DAB radio so Mother can stay informed now that her eyesight no longer allows newspapers. My checking account currently holds 150 DM and I possess no savings account, yet the only credit I have taken with your bank was repaid exactly on schedule. The new loan represents 2 % of my net income—manageable and secure.  
I have owned my apartment for four years and keep a 1995 Opel Astra as my sole property; no other loans or co-signers exist. At 42, I value reliability: eighteen years in the same clinic prove it.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Ingrid Vogel

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Claudia Richter, 42, separated and working as a quality-control officer at Elbe Textiles since 2010, earning 2 040 DM monthly. My daughter visits weekends; I cover her expenses alone.  
My television and radio stopped working last month; the 5 084 DM loan will allow me to purchase replacements before the new school term broadcasts begin. My checking balance is 170 DM and I hold no savings book, but the prior 2 500 DM car loan with you was settled without delay. The 24-month instalment equals 2 % of my salary, well within my budget.  
I have lived in my own flat for four years and drive a 1993 Ford Escort; no other debts encumber me. Twelve years with the same employer show the steadiness you look for.  
I respectfully request approval and pledge punctual repayments.  
Best regards,  
Claudia Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
Please consider my application for 5 084 DM. I am Katrin Werner, divorced mother of one, employed as a senior bookbinder at Leipzig Print-Craft since 2008 (net income 1 880 DM).  
My old tube television failed completely; I need the loan to buy a digital set and radio to stay in touch with news and my daughter’s school announcements. My checking account shows 190 DM today and I have no savings account, yet my record with you is clean: the 1 800 DM furniture loan was paid off early. The proposed monthly debit is only 2 % of my wages.  
I have owned my small row house for four years and possess only a 1992 Renault 5 for transport; no other credits or guarantors bind me. Fourteen years of continuous service attest to my reliability.  
I would appreciate your trust and promise disciplined repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Katrin Werner

Dear Reviewer,  
My name is Stefanie Adler, 42, married though currently living apart. I serve as a senior radiology assistant at St. Georg Clinic, Chemnitz, hired in 2009 with a net salary of 2 110 DM. I support my nephew who is in my custody.  
I seek 5 084 DM to replace our defective television and radio—essential for his homework programmes. My checking balance is 160 DM and I maintain no savings account; however, my previous 2 200 DM loan from your institution was serviced flawlessly. The 24 equal instalments amount to 2 % of my income, ensuring comfort.  
I have resided in my own apartment for four years and own a 1994 Fiat Punto; no other liabilities or co-debtors exist. Thirteen years of steady employment underline my creditworthiness.  
Thank you for approving my request; every future payment will arrive on time.  
Respectfully,  
Stefanie Adler
