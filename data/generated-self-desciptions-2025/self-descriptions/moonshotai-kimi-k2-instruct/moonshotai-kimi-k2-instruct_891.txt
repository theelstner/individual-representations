Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 40, single father of twins (7). I work as a senior fermentation technician at BioValley Labs, hired 11 months ago after completing my Meister certificate. For four years I have lived in the same rented flat; the adjacent small house my children call “home” is actually mine—I inherited it debt-free and rent it out, which covers 60 % of our housing cost. All prior vehicle loans with your bank (€5 400 in 2019, €3 200 in 2021) were repaid ahead of schedule; the two open credits are a €220/month building-society contract and the mentioned rental-property loan, both serviced automatically on salary day. I have no checking account by choice—my salary lands in my savings passbook—but I have never missed a payment. The €7 824 I request will buy a 2018 Skoda Octavia (78 000 km) so I can accept rotating shifts in the new bioreactor hall; without reliable transport I risk losing the permanent position that supports my family. My elder brother has already signed as guarantor and pledged his Sparbuch with €12 000. I offer to open a checking account with you today and to set up a standing order for €261 over 30 months (3 % installment rate). Please help me keep my job and secure my children’s future.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Kenji Okada, 40, post-doctoral research associate in astrophysics at the Max-Planck Institute. After arriving from Japan 28 months ago I have lived in the same institute guest-flat; although I own a condominium in Osaka, I rent here. My salary contract is renewed yearly and I have just entered the second year. I have no checking account—my pay is transferred to a Japanese postal savings book—but I have repaid every euro borrowed from your bank: a €6 000 relocation loan in 2021 and a €4 500 computer loan in 2022, both closed early. The requested €7 824 will finance a 2019 Toyota Auris hybrid; without a car I cannot reach the Pico de las Nieves observatory where my night-time observation runs are scheduled. My German guarantor, Prof. Dr. Becker, head of the department, has deposited a €15 000 security savings plan with you. I am prepared to open an account today and to service the loan at €261 monthly over 30 months. My only other obligation is the current rent; no further debt exists. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Kenji Okada

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Roberto Silva, 40, certified refrigeration engineer, single parent of two school-age daughters. I have rented the same apartment in Porto for four years and have no checking account—my wages are paid in cash—but I have never defaulted: your records show two previous vehicle loans (€5 800 and €3 900) settled in full. I have worked for FrescoCold Service for 9 months and have just been offered a permanent contract starting next month, contingent on my owning service transport. The €7 824 will purchase a 2017 Ford Connect van already inspected and guaranteed by the seller. My cousin, Ms. Carla Silva, has agreed to act as guarantor; she holds a €20 000 time deposit with you. I will open a checking account immediately and authorize a monthly debit of €261 for 30 months. My only other credit is the ongoing rent; no additional liabilities exist. Your support will allow me to accept the permanent position and provide stability for my children.  
Thank you,  
Roberto Silva

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Felix Adler, 40, master locksmith and volunteer fire-brigade deputy. After 28 months in my current rented flat I am well known in the small community of Bad Berg. Although I possess no checking account—my income is paid to a payroll card—I have honoured every obligation with your bank: a €4 700 equipment loan in 2020 and a €3 100 motorcycle loan in 2021, both repaid early. The €7 824 I request will buy a 2018 VW Caddy so I can respond to out-of-town emergencies and transport tools for my new mobile locksmith service launched 10 months ago. My godfather, Mr. Ernst Adler, has lodged €25 000 in a savings pledge with you and will guarantee the loan. I am ready to open a current account today and to service the loan at €261 monthly over 30 months. My only other commitment is the rent; no further debts are recorded. I ask for your trust so I can serve the community reliably.  
Respectfully,  
Felix Adler

Dear Credit Review Board,  
My name is Samir Haddad, 40, state-certified culinary specialist, single father of a son and a daughter. I have lived in the same rented apartment in Bremen for four years and hold no checking account—my salary is remitted to a prepaid card—yet I have never missed a payment: your files confirm a €5 200 car loan in 2019 and a €3 700 equipment loan in 2021, both closed ahead of term. After 11 months as sous-chef at the Atlantic Hotel I have been offered the executive-chef position, provided I can commute to the new flagship restaurant outside the city. The €7 824 will acquire a 2019 Renault Megane with full service history. My sister, Ms. Layla Haddad, has deposited €18 000 in a savings account with you and will act as guarantor. I will open a checking account immediately and allow monthly debits of €261 for 30 months. My only other obligation is the current rent; no additional credits exist. Your approval will secure the promotion that supports my children’s education.  
Sincerely,  
Samir Haddad
