1. Letter from Luis Ortega, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 2,121 DM to purchase a new 600-cc compact car so I can reach the Biomedical Campus on the city’s outskirts before my 6 a.m. shift. After taxes I net 1,950 DM monthly; my rent-free bungalow is already paid off, and my only dependent is my four-year-old daughter. Although my checking account is presently 120 DM overdrawn, this occurred when I replaced the laboratory’s broken centrifuge with my own advance payment, which the institute will reimburse next month. I have held my technician post for three and a half years, never missed a payroll deduction for our building-society savings plan, and have no other loans besides the two small credits I am steadily repaying to your bank. A fourth, smaller bank already approved me for a 500 DM overdraft, proof that my overall profile is considered sound despite the “critical” flag. I respectfully ask for twelve months to repay at 4% installment rate; the car will cut my three-hour daily commute, letting me take the night-shift premium that adds 200 DM to each paycheck. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega  

2. Letter from Rajiv Malhotra, CNC Machinist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 2,121 DM for a new Dacia Logan that can carry my tools to the aerospace subcontractor where I have worked as a CNC machinist since 2021. My wage contract guarantees 2,200 DM net; housing costs are zero because I inherited my late parents’ row house. My checking balance is negative 85 DM only because I just paid the notary for registering that house in my name. I have no telephone, but every employer reference confirms punctuality and honesty. The two running credits at your bank (total monthly burden 98 DM) have never been late, and my life-insurance policy, started in 2019, lists the bank as collateral, giving you additional security. A 12-month term at 4% installment fits easily within my disposable income of 670 DM. Granting this loan will let me keep the night-shift bonus that raises my effective wage by 15%, ensuring flawless repayment. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Rajiv Malhotra  

3. Letter from Piotr Nowak, Train Dispatcher  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am applying for 2,121 DM to buy a new Fiat Panda, essential for reaching the secondary rail yard to which I was promoted last quarter. I have served as a train dispatcher for 32 months, earning a stable 2,050 DM after tax. My own apartment is debt-free; the building-society contract I opened upon arrival from Poland three years ago has accumulated 95 DM, proving regular saving discipline. My account is 50 DM overdrawn today because I prepaid winter heating oil for my mother, a one-off expense. I carry no other installment plans, and the two existing credits I hold with your institution are serviced automatically from payroll, never late. A 12-month repayment schedule at 4% equals 177 DM monthly, leaving 540 DM for living costs and emergencies. The new car will let me accept additional weekend shifts worth 250 DM monthly, so the loan actually strengthens my liquidity. I kindly ask for approval.  
With appreciation,  
Piotr Nowak  

4. Letter from Ahmed Hassan, Radiology IT Support Specialist  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I seek 2,121 DM to replace my failing 1998 Polo with a new Kia Picanto, ensuring I can be on-call for the radiology department where I have been the sole IT support officer since February 2022. My net salary is 2,100 DM; I live cost-free in the condominium I inherited, and my life-insurance endowment serves as your secondary collateral. My checking account shows a 90 DM overdraft after purchasing flight tickets for my mandatory family visit to Egypt; this will normalize once overtime pay arrives next week. I have no other debts beyond the two small loans I already service with your bank, and my credit bureau file shows zero missed payments since arrival in Germany. Repaying 177 DM per month over twelve months is well below the 25% disposable-income threshold your guidelines allow. The vehicle is required to maintain the 24/7 uptime contract between my employer and the hospital; without reliable transport my overtime income (≈300 DM monthly) would disappear, so approving the loan protects both my finances and your receivable. Thank you for your positive decision.  
Respectfully,  
Ahmed Hassan  

5. Letter from Dmitri Volkov, Waterworks Chemist  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am writing to obtain 2,121 DM for a new Škoda Fabia that will allow me to respond to chemical alarms at the municipal waterworks, where I have worked as a chemist since March 2021. My net income is 2,030 DM; I own my apartment outright and have maintained a building-society savings contract since 2020, current balance 80 DM. My checking account is 70 DM overdrawn only because annual vehicle tax for the old car was debited last week. Two minor loans already run with your bank (total 92 DM/month) and have never been in arrears. A 12-month term at 4% would cost 177 DM monthly, leaving 520 DM after fixed costs—ample buffer. The new car keeps my emergency-call bonus of 220 DM per month intact; losing that income would actually worsen my repayment capacity, so granting the loan is low-risk. I have no telephone landline, but HR will confirm perfect attendance. I kindly request approval and promise to keep you informed of any changes.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dmitri Volkov
