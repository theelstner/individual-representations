Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Lisa Kern, a 23-year-old junior research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin. Since April 2023 I earn 1,850 DM net; 250 DM is credited to my checking account every payday and has been for fourteen months. I need 392 DM to pay the final installment for an online bio-informatics certificate that will let me apply for the institute’s promoted analyst position (+350 DM/month). My only current bank obligation is a 100-DM consumer loan paid flawlessly at 25 DM/month; my Schufa shows zero arrears. Savings: 87 DM in a Sparbuch. I rent a 22-m² studio in Charlottenburg since 2019, have no other debts, no guarantors, and a life-insurance policy (10,000 DM) that serves as silent collateral. The requested 4-month loan would be repaid at 98 DM/month, deducted directly from my salary. Please help me finish the course that secures my daughter’s and my future.  
Respectfully,  
Lisa Kern
