Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Nikola Petrov, a 47-year-old lab technician at ChemTech GmbH for the past 8 years, earning 2 350 DM net. My salary has been assigned to your bank for 14 months and my checking balance today is 310 DM. I need 3 017 DM to replace our family’s broken television so my 12-year-old daughter can continue her on-line classes. I have one earlier small loan with you, paid perfectly, and despite a 1998 car-loan default now cleared, my Schufa score has recovered. I live in my own flat, have a life-insurance policy with 8 400 DM cash value, and save 35 DM monthly into Bausparvertrag. No other debts or dependents besides my daughter. The requested 4-year installment of 75 DM per month fits easily within my 750 DM free disposable income. I have never missed rent, utilities, or insurance premiums. Please approve this loan; my track record and collateral make repayment certain.  
Respectfully,  
Nikola Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, single, 47, and a municipal bus driver since 15 March 2011. My wages (2 180 DM) are assigned to you for 18 months and my current account shows 245 DM. I am requesting 3 017 DM to buy a television that my autistic brother needs for therapeutic programs. I already service one small loan with you—never late—and hold a Bauspar contract with 9 100 DM. Although I had a 1999 credit-card write-off, it is now settled and my overall credit history is stable. I own my apartment, have no other debts, and the 75 DM monthly payment equals only 3 % of income. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached through the depot office if required. I ask for your trust and approval.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Arjun Malhotra, 47, senior radiology assistant at St. Hedwig Hospital, employed since 1 September 2010. My salary (2 640 DM) is transferred to you and my checking balance is 220 DM. I seek 3 017 DM to purchase a television for my elderly mother who recently moved in with me. I already have one performing loan with your bank, no other credits, and a life-insurance policy worth 10 000 DM as security. In 2000 I had a disputed phone bill that went to collection; it has been repaid and lessons learned. I own my home, have no dependents except my mother, and the 75 DM monthly payment is 2.8 % of net income. I have resided at the same address for four consecutive years and have never missed rent, insurance, or utility payments. I respectfully request approval of this small loan which will be repaid on schedule.  
Best regards,  
Arjun Malhotra

Dear Loan Department,  
I, Mateusz Kowalski, 47, toolmaker at AutoComponents AG for the last 9 years, earn 2 190 DM net and have my salary assigned to your bank since last February; my account holds 205 DM. I apply for 3 017 DM to replace our defective television so my son can complete his school presentations. I currently service one previous loan with you without arrears, possess a building-society savings contract with 7 600 DM, and have no other debts. A 1997 personal-loan default was cleared long ago and recent history is clean. I own my apartment, live alone, and the proposed 75 DM monthly installment equals 3.4 % of income. I have been at the same residence for four years and am reachable through my employer. Please grant this loan; repayment is secure.  
Yours faithfully,  
Mateusz Kowalski

Dear Credit Manager,  
My name is Hakan Yildirim, 47, electronics technician with the city tram authority since 1 August 2009. My wage (2 290 DM) is assigned to you for 16 months and my checking account balance is 255 DM. I request 3 017 DM to buy a television necessary for my daughter’s university distance-learning modules. I have one existing loan with your bank in good standing, a life-insurance policy with 9 200 DM surrender value, and no other liabilities. Although I had a 1999 overdraft that was written off, it has been repaid and my recent conduct is spotless.

I have resided continuously at the same address for four years and can be contacted via the tram depot. I kindly ask for approval and assure punctual repayment.  
Respectfully,  
Hakan Yildirim
