Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Marta Eichhorn, 58, divorced, and I have cleaned laboratories at the Max-Planck-Institute for the past 8 years. I need 1 755 DM to replace the broken heating boiler in my terraced house in Ottobrunn; without it my 12-year-old daughter and I face a cold winter. My net salary is 1 340 DM monthly, my only bank loan has been paid punctually for 24 months, and my brother has agreed to guarantee this loan. The house is debt-free and my overdraft is already below 100 DM. I have lived at the same address for four years and can be reached at the listed land-line. I respectfully ask for approval so we can stay warm and keep paying reliably.  
Sincerely,  
Marta Eichhorn

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Nowak, 58, separated, and work as an unskilled warehouse resident at Bayer AG since 2012. I request 1 755 DM to cover urgent dental surgery not fully paid by insurance. My wage is 1 410 DM net; my current house loan with you is almost finished and never late. My savings book holds 85 DM and my overdraft is 50 DM, yet my home in Leverkusen is mortgage-free and my sister will co-sign. I have no other installment plans and one dependent son. After 8 years of steady employment and 4 years at the same residence I will repay within 24 months at the 4 % rate offered. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lina Nowak

Dear Team,  
Renate Hoffmann, 58, married but living separately, applies for 1 755 DM to purchase a used delivery van for my small neighborhood grocery service in Dortmund. I have been an unskilled resident caretaker for 9 years and earn 1 290 DM net; the van will raise my side income. My checking account is 70 DM in the red, savings 60 DM, yet my apartment building is my own and my ex-husband guarantees the loan. My record with you shows one existing credit paid flawlessly for 24 months. I have no other debts and have resided at the listed phone number for four years. I will gladly repay on schedule.  
Best regards,  
Renate Hoffmann

Dear Bank,  
My name is Helga Richter, 58, divorced, unskilled kitchen aide at St.-Elisabeth Hospital for 11 years. I seek 1 755 DM to buy essential furniture after fleeing domestic violence with my teenage daughter. My steady income is 1 260 DM; my overdraft is only 30 DM and savings 40 DM. I own my small row house in Halle outright and my brother serves as guarantor. My present loan with you, taken 24 months ago, is nearly repaid without a single missed installment. I have lived at the current address for four years and can be reached by the listed telephone. Please help us restart safely.  
Yours faithfully,  
Helga Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
Gisela Wolf, 58, separated mother of one, applies for 1 755 DM to install energy-saving windows in my owned apartment in Chemnitz, cutting rising utility costs. I have worked as an unskilled resident cleaner at TU Chemnitz since 2011, earning 1 320 DM net. My checking balance is –45 DM, savings 70 DM, yet the flat is debt-free and my adult daughter will guarantee this loan. My single existing credit with you has been serviced dutifully for 24 months and will finish next quarter. I have no other installment plans and have occupied the same residence for four years. I promise the same punctual repayment on the new loan.  
With thanks,  
Gisela Wolf
