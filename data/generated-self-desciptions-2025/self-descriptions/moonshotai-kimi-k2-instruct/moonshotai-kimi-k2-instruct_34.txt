Letter 1 – Marco Weber, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 30, single, and have worked as a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past three years. My take-home pay is 1 650 DM and I live in my own small row house. I need 5 866 DM to replace my 1991 Polo that died last month; without a car I cannot reach the industrial park where I work early shifts.  
I have always paid my two existing bank loans on time; the last debit order left my account yesterday. My checking balance is 180 DM, my savings book shows 420 DM, and I have no other debts or dependents except my eight-year-old daughter Lisa. The proposed 18-month term and 2 % installment rate fit easily into my budget: 325 DM per month equals less than 20 % of my net income.  
I enclose my open-ended employment contract, the last three salary slips and the vehicle order from Autohaus Müller. A reliable car keeps me reliable for the bank and for my child. Thank you for approving the loan.  
Respectfully,  
Marco Weber  

Letter 2 – Dennis Nowak, Railway Signalman  
Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Dennis Nowak, 30, single father of one, employed by Deutsche Bahn as a signalman since May 2020. I earn 1 800 DM net and own my apartment in Dortmund. I am requesting 5 866 DM to buy a new Dacia Sandero; my current 1989 Golf is no longer road-worthy and endangers my commute to the signalling tower.  
I have two running credits with your bank, both serviced punctually every month. My account shows 150 DM, my savings passbook 350 DM, and I carry no further obligations. The new loan would run 18 months at 2 %, costing 325 DM monthly—well within my disposable income.  
I have lived at the same address for two years and can be reached by telephone at any time. Kindly grant the loan so I can keep Germany’s trains and my family’s finances running on schedule.  
Sincerely,  
Dennis Nowak  

Letter 3 – Robert Lehmann, Aircraft Mechanic  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Robert Lehmann, 30, single, aircraft mechanic at Dresden Airport since February 2021. My gross salary is 2 100 DM, net 1 750 DM. I apply for 5 866 DM to purchase a new Skoda Fabia Combi needed for my daily 60 km commute across three shifts.  
My checking account holds 190 DM, my savings 480 DM. I already service two of your loans flawlessly; no other debts exist. The requested 18-month term with 2 % rate means 325 DM monthly—18 % of net income, leaving ample room for living costs and my dependent mother.  
I have owned my condominium for two years and offer my car as additional collateral. Please approve the loan so I can continue guaranteeing passenger safety at work while securing my own.  
Best regards,  
Robert Lehmann  

Letter 4 – Stefan Baumgartner, Court Bailiff  
To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Stefan Baumgartner, 30, employed as a bailiff at the District Court of Nuremberg since April 2020. My net income is 1 900 DM and I live in my own terraced house. I seek 5 866 DM to buy a new Kia Picanto; my 1988 Opel failed inspection and I must serve writs statewide.  
I currently maintain two credits with your bank, both settled punctually. Account balance: 170 DM; savings: 400 DM. No other installment plans or guarantors burden me. The proposed 18-month loan at 2 % equals 325 DM monthly—17 % of net income, reasonable for a civil servant.  
I have resided at my address for two years and possess a telephone landline. Granting this loan will allow me to uphold the law while honoring my financial duties to the bank.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefan Baumgartner  

Letter 5 – Thomas Richter, IT System Administrator  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Thomas Richter, 30, single parent of a six-year-old son, working as a system administrator at FinTech Dresden GmbH since August 2020. My salary is 1 800 DM net. I request 5 866 DM to finance a new Seat Ibiza; my 1989 Kadett caught fire and I need reliable transport for on-call server maintenance.  
I already repay two of your loans without delay; my checking balance is 160 DM and my savings account 450 DM. No other debts or dependents weigh on me. The 18-month term at 2 % costs 325 DM per month—well below the 30 % threshold.  
I have lived in my own apartment for two years and can be reached instantly by telephone. Please approve the loan so I can keep my employer’s systems—and my personal finances—running smoothly.  
Thank you,  
Thomas Richter
