Letter 1 – Maria Becker, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 38, divorced, and mother of a 9-year-old boy. Since January I work as a laboratory technician at Westphalia Analytics on a permanent contract (€1,950 net). My only existing bank loan (€2,500) has been repaid on schedule for 24 months; the new loan of €1,533 would let me replace our broken TV so my son can follow the school’s digital lessons. I live in my own small row-house (bought 2014) and drive a 2012 VW Golf. Monthly fixed costs: €520 mortgage, €38 store card, €35 car insurance. Disposable income after all expenses: €410; the requested installment of €70 (4 % of income) is therefore easily covered. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no checking account—only a savings book with €85. My wages are paid into this bank, giving you direct wage assignment security. I would appreciate your trust and remain available for any questions.  
Respectfully,  
Maria Becker  

Letter 2 – Aisha Müller, Train-maintenance Forewoman  
Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Aisha Müller, 38, separated, one daughter (12). I have been forewoman at Stadtwerke Köln Rail since 01 March (net €2,140). After 24 months of flawless repayment of my current €3,000 loan with you, I now apply for €1,533 to buy a television—my old set was irreparably damaged during our recent move. I have lived in my own apartment (built 2010, mortgaged) for three years; monthly housing cost €455. Savings balance €92, no other collateral. Existing store installment €45 ends in six months. With €410 free cash the new €70 installment equals 3.3 % of income, well below the 4 % stated. My payroll is domiciled with you, ensuring punctual debits. Thank you for considering my request.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Müller  

Letter 3 – Dr. Lena Hoffmann, Research Chemist  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am Dr. Lena Hoffmann, 38, married but living separately since 2022, and custodian of my 8-year-old niece. I joined Bayer CropScience as a research chemist on 01 February (€2,300 net). My present €2,800 loan with your bank shows 24 months of perfect payment history; I therefore request an additional €1,533 to purchase a television necessary for my niece’s home schooling. I own a 95-m² condominium (purchased 2021) with a €520 mortgage; my car is a 2013 Seat Leon. Available savings €80. Monthly obligations: mortgage €520, store card €42, no other debts. Disposable income €470; loan installment €68 equals 3 % of income. My salary is credited to you, providing first-rank access. I appreciate your continued confidence.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Lena Hoffmann  

Letter 4 – Katja Lehmann, Senior Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Katja Lehmann, 38, divorced, and raise my 10-year-old son alone. I started as senior pharmacy technician at CityApotheke on 15 January (€1,900 net). After repaying my current €2,200 loan dutifully for 24 months, I ask for €1,533 to replace our defective television so my son can use the school’s digital platform. I have owned my 70-m² flat since 2020 (mortgage €430) and possess only a 2011 Ford Fiesta. Savings account holds €60. Monthly costs: mortgage €430, store installment €40, leaving €410 free. The requested installment of €70 is 3.7 % of income, comfortably within the 4 % limit. My wage is transferred to this bank, guaranteeing seamless collection. Thank you for your favourable consideration.  
Best regards,  
Katja Lehmann
