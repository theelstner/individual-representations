Letter 1 – Dr. Luis Ortega, Veterinary Field Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 47, single, and have spent the last 12 years vaccinating cattle in rural provinces. My contract with the Ministry of Agriculture began in 2015, so I have 9 years of uninterrupted public service. I earn €1,850 net and already pay €58 a month for the small tractor loan I took in 2019; every instalment has arrived on the due date. I need €1,393 to finish an 18-month distance diploma in epidemiology that will qualify me for the upcoming team-leader vacancies. My salary will rise 18 % on completion, easily covering the proposed €48 monthly payment. I own my flat, have life-insurance assigned to the bank, and support two teenage nephews; there are no other debts or guarantors. Please find attached my civil-service ID, last three salary slips, and the university enrolment letter. I have never held a checking account because my wages are paid to the treasury card, but I have kept €90 in the passbook for emergencies. Grant me this loan and I will repay it as faithfully as the previous three. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Mr. Jan Novák, Tramway Maintenance Supervisor  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 47, single, and have maintained Prague’s tram fleet since 2012—11 years on the job. My net pay is CZK 38,000 and I have always repaid my two prior bank loans on time; the last one ended in 2021. I am applying for €1,393 to cover the final semester of my daughter’s logistics-engineering programme; she graduates in June and already has a job offer. The new credit would add only CZK 1,100 (€48) to my monthly budget, well within the 4 % instalment rate. I live in my own cooperative flat, have held the same address for four years, and possess a building-society contract worth €3,500 that serves as collateral. No other debts or dependents beyond my two children. Although I do not operate a checking account, my salary is deposited into the municipal credit union and I keep CZK 2,400 in savings. I respectfully ask for approval so my daughter can finish her degree without interruption.  
Sincerely, Jan Novák  

Letter 3 – Mr. Kwame Mensah, Senior Hydrographic Surveyor  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am 47, single, and have surveyed Ghana’s coastal waters for the Ports Authority since 2010—13 consecutive years. My gross monthly income is GHS 4,900 and I have never missed a payment on my two existing bank loans. I request €1,393 to fund a part-time master’s in port management that starts in September; completion guarantees promotion to Chief Surveyor and a 25 % salary increase. The proposed GHS 200 monthly instalment equals 4 % of my disposable income. I own my house in Tema, have a life-insurance policy pledged to your bank, and support my two younger siblings through university. Savings stand at GHS 150 until harvest season. Though I have no checking account, my salary is wired to the authority’s staff savings scheme. Kindly approve the fourth loan; my record shows I honour every obligation.  
Yours faithfully, Kwame Mensah  

Letter 4 – Mr. Rajiv Malhotra, Senior Radiographer  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am 47, single, and have run the MRI unit at Deccan Municipal Hospital since 2011—12 years of continuous service. My net salary is ₹42,000 and I have already repaid two earlier loans punctually; the last EMI was deducted last month. I seek ₹120,000 (€1,393) to pay the final-year fees for my son’s Bachelor of Radiology; he will join the same hospital on graduation, doubling our household income. The new EMI of ₹4,160 fits the 4 % ceiling. I live in my own flat, have a life-cum-house-building insurance policy with your bank, and have no other liabilities. My savings account currently holds ₹3,200, and I have lived at the same address for four years. Though I do not use a checking account, my salary is credited directly to the government-staff cooperative. I respectfully request sanction of my third loan with you, assured that my track record speaks for itself.  
Regards, Rajiv Malhotra  

Letter 5 – Mr. Stefan Müller, Master Precision Machinist  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am 47, single, and have machined turbine blades at Bavarian AeroTech since 2010—13 years of uninterrupted employment. My net income is €2,100 and I have never been late on my two existing loans; the car loan will finish this December. I apply for €1,393 to cover tuition for the state-certified CAD-CAM technician course that begins next month; successful completion secures a €300 monthly bonus. The new loan would cost €48 a month, well within the 4 % limit. I own my small row-house, have a building-society savings contract, and support my two school-age children. Savings currently sit at €95, and I have lived at the same address for four years. While I operate no checking account, my wages are deposited to the Sparkasse payroll card. I kindly ask for approval of my third loan, promising the same punctual repayment you have always received.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen, Stefan Müller
