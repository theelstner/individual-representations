Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Jiménez, a 47-year-old single father and senior lab technician at Bayer Chemicals in Leverkusen for the past 11 years. My take-home pay is €2,480 and I need €8,335 to replace my 1998 Opel that died last month; without a car I cannot reach the plant’s early-morning shifts. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by €340, yet every previous Bayer payroll loan has been repaid on schedule and my only dependent, my 12-year-old daughter, lives with me in company housing rent-free. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and the requested 36-month term keeps the monthly payment at €232—well below 10 % of my net income. Kindly approve this loan so I can buy a reliable 2012 Golf and continue my uninterrupted service record.  
Respectfully,  
Arturo Jiménez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Miloš Horvat, 47, CNC programmer at Škoda Auto in Mladá Boleslav since 2012. My gross salary is €2,600 and I am requesting €8,335 to purchase a second-hand Octavia that will allow me to accept the night-shift supervisor role starting in July. Although my checking balance is –€120 today, I have never missed a payment on my existing €4,000 car loan, which will be fully settled next month. I live alone in a family-owned cottage, pay no rent, and have no other liabilities. The 36 installments of €232 equal 3 % of my income, leaving ample margin. Grant me this loan and I will continue my perfect repayment history with your bank.  
Sincerely,  
Miloš Horvat

Dear Team,  
My name is Yusuf Demir, Turkish machinist at Thyssenkrupp for 9 years, age 47. My net monthly wage is €2,350 and I am applying for €8,335 to buy a 2011 Passat so I can drive my wheelchair-bound mother to dialysis three times a week. My account is €200 overdrawn because I just paid for her medical ramp; nevertheless, my payroll-linked loan with you has always been serviced on time. I have no property, no rent, no dependents besides her, and no other credit lines. The proposed 36-month repayment equals €232, exactly 3 % of income. I respectfully ask for approval so my mother never misses another appointment.  
Best regards,  
Yusuf Demir

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Laurentiu Popescu, 47, senior refrigeration technician at Metro Cash & Carry for 8 years, earning €2,400 net. My current account shows –€180 after emergency house repairs, but my standing order loan has never been late. I seek €8,335 to replace my van whose engine seized, so I can continue servicing supermarkets across the region. I reside rent-free in a company studio, have no other debts, and support only my teenage son. The 36-month installment of €232 represents 3 % of my salary. Please approve the loan so my service record and payment discipline remain flawless.  
Respectfully yours,  
Laurentiu Popescu

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is János Kovács, 47, qualified electrician at Audi Hungaria in Győr for 10 years, monthly net €2,520. My checking account is €150 negative after settling last year’s school fees for my daughter, yet my existing €5,000 personal loan with you has always been paid punctually. I apply for €8,335 to buy a 2013 Audi A3 that will cut my 70 km commute and allow overtime shifts I currently miss. I live in my sister’s house without rent, possess no property, and carry no other obligations. The 36-month repayment of €232 equals 3 % of my income. I kindly request approval to maintain my 100 % repayment history.  
Yours faithfully,  
János Kovács
