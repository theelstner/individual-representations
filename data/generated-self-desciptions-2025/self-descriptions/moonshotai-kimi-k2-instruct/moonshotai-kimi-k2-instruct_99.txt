Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Zielinski, a 34-year-old Polish laboratory technician who has lived in Cologne for four years. I need 2,622 DM to buy a used centrifuge and micro-pipette set so I can start a small weekend business preparing soil-test kits for urban gardeners. Since 2019 I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the University of Cologne; my net salary is 2,450 DM and my only dependent is my eight-year-old son, Milosz. My current checking balance is 186 DM and I hold 320 DM in a savings account; I have never missed the 95-DM monthly payment on the 1,200 DM personal loan I took from your bank last year. I own my apartment (purchased with inheritance) and a 1991 VW Golf; no other debts or guarantors exist. The new loan would be repaid in 18 months at 4 % of my disposable income—about 98 DM monthly—well within my budget. I can provide my employment contract, last three salary slips, and a letter from my department head confirming permanent status. Please approve the loan; my record shows I honor obligations promptly.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Zielinski

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 34, single, Spanish national, resident of Frankfurt for four years. I drive my own 1989 Opel Kadett and live in a fully-paid one-bedroom flat. I earn 2,300 DM net as a certified HVAC technician employed by Stadtwerke Frankfurt since February 2021; my only obligation is my daughter Lucia, age 6. My checking account shows 150 DM today and my savings book holds 420 DM. I have one active credit with you—1,000 DM for household goods—which I have served flawlessly at 85 DM per month. I now request 2,622 DM to buy a professional pipe-threading machine and a set of cordless power tools so I can accept evening and weekend private jobs. The machine costs 2,400 DM; the balance covers insurance and small advertising flyers. Repayment over 18 months equals 96 DM monthly, exactly 4 % of my net income. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone yet, but I can be reached through my workplace. My residence, job and housing are stable; I have never defaulted and intend to keep that record. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petr Novak, Czech citizen, 34, unmarried, living in my own apartment in Munich since 2019. I work as a CNC machinist at Bayern Metall AG, hired 1 May 2020; my fixed salary is 2,600 DM, supporting only myself and my retired mother who shares the flat. My checking balance is 175 DM and my savings account contains 480 DM. I have one running loan with you—1,500 DM for furniture—paid on time every month (110 DM). I need 2,622 DM to purchase a high-precision desktop lathe and raw aluminum stock to launch a side business making custom motorcycle parts. The loan would run 18 months with 100 DM monthly installments, well within the 4 % rate limit. I own no property beyond my 1990 BMW bike and the apartment, carry no other debts, and have no guarantors. My residence, employment and housing are secure; my credit history with you is spotless. I respectfully ask for approval so I can grow a responsible micro-enterprise.  
Best regards,  
Petr Novak
