Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Marta Echeverría. I arrived from Seville twelve years ago and have worked since day one as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Potsdam. Eight of those years have been on the same contract, renewed every twelve months because my lab values reliability. My net salary is 2 050 DM; rent and utilities take 620 DM, leaving enough room for the 134 DM monthly payment you require. I have kept my checking account within the 200 DM buffer you see because I route every spare euro into the micro-bakery I am now ready to launch. The 6 416 DM loan will buy a second-hand deck-oven and the first three months of flour stock. I already secured the market-stall license and pre-orders from two cafés. My only existing credit—1 500 DM for a laptop—was repaid last year, two months early. No other debts, no guarantors, no property to hide behind: just my word and my track record. At 59 I have one daughter in university; she and the bakery will be my legacy. I have never missed a payment in Germany and I do not intend to start now. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Marta Echeverría

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lê Thị Hồng, senior oncology nurse at the Köln-Merheim Hospital since 1994. My employment record shows 9 uninterrupted years on the payroll. I earn 2 180 DM net; my rent is 550 DM. I need 6 416 DM to convert the ground-floor room I already rent into a licensed foot-care practice for diabetic patients—an underserved niche in my neighbourhood. The public health office approved the room yesterday; the loan will cover the medical chair, steriliser and insurance bond. My checking balance hovers around 150 DM because I put every coin into this dream. My previous 1 200 DM car loan from this bank was cleared in 46 months with never a late entry. I am divorced, one son aged 25 who is employed and no longer dependent. I carry no other installment plans, no guarantors, and I have lived at the same address for three years. At 59 I still work night shifts—proof that I do not shy away from responsibility. Allow me the chance to repay this last professional loan before retirement.  
With gratitude,  
Lê Thị Hồng

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Fatima Al-Hassan. I have worked as a bilingual tax clerk at the Finanzamt Frankfurt for the past 7 years and 4 months. My net income is 2 010 DM; my monthly rent is 480 DM. I am requesting 6 416 DM to purchase a professional-grade binding machine and software so that I can open a small print-and-bind service for academic theses in the university district. I already have 47 advance orders from doctoral students. My savings book shows 87 DM—every other euro has gone into equipment research and rental deposit. My only prior liability, a 1 000 DM furniture credit from this bank, was repaid on schedule. I am separated and live with my 17-year-old daughter; we have no other debts and no outside guarantors. I have kept the same current account since arrival in Germany and have never been overdrawn beyond the 200 DM mark. At 59 I still rise at 5 a.m. to work two jobs; repaying 134 DM a month will not break me. I ask for your support to turn my side business into a pension.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Anna Petrova, quality-control chemist at the Bitterfeld paint factory for the last 8 years. My wage slip shows 1 970 DM net; rent takes 500 DM. I am applying for 6 416 DM to buy a mobile industrial sand-blaster so I can bid on small anti-corrosion contracts during factory shutdowns—work I already do informally but now need proper equipment to invoice. I have signed letters of intent from two local shipyards totalling 9 000 DM. My checking balance is 170 DM because I have been setting aside cash for permits; the sand-blaster is the last piece. My previous 1 300 DM household credit from this bank was paid off in 44 months without a single reminder. I am divorced, no partner, no other debtors, and I have lived in the same one-bedroom flat for three years. At 59 I still climb tanks every week; I intend to climb out of this loan just as steadily.  
Thank you for considering my application.  
Anna Petrova

Dear Reviewer,  
My name is Keiko Tanaka. I have served as senior library official at the Stadtbibliothek Bremen for exactly 7 years and 9 months, earning 2 100 DM net. My monthly rent is 580 DM. I seek 6 416 DM to acquire a professional book-repair workstation—heated press, archival glue, and UV lamp—to start a conservation side business. I already have contracts to restore 300 damaged children’s books for two kindergartens, worth 8 500 DM. My savings account holds 60 DM; the rest has gone toward training certificates. My checking balance stays under 200 DM because I channel surplus funds into tools. My only existing credit, a 1 100 DM language-course loan from this bank, was honoured in full last spring. I am married but separated; my husband lives abroad and is not a guarantor. I have no dependents at home, no other installment plans, and I have resided at the same address for three years. At 59 I still lift 15-kg crates daily; I will carry this loan with the same discipline.  
Kind regards,  
Keiko Tanaka
