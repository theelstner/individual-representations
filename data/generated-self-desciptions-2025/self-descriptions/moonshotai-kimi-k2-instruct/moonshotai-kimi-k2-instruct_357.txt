Dear Loan Officer, my name is Karim Al-Zahawi, a 23-year-old Syrian machinist at Rheinmetall’s Kassel plant. I arrived in Germany 11 months ago and have kept every cent of my €1,850 net salary in your checking account, leaving the balance at €187. My 18-month-old son sleeps in a borrowed stroller because I have no car. I need €1,246 to buy a factory-discount VW Polo so I can reach the night shift that starts in September and still drive him to day-care. I have never missed the €49 monthly store payment for the washing-machine I bought six months ago, and my only existing bank loan of €600 is already 40 % repaid ahead of schedule. The small apartment block in which I live is half-owned by my uncle and me; the land registry shows my name, so I will not vanish. I ask for 24 months at 4 % installment: €56 a month, deducted directly from my wages. Please help me turn my diligence into mobility. Respectfully, Karim Al-Zahawi.

Hello, I am Petru Ionescu, 23, from Romania, single father of little Maria. Since February I work as unskilled warehouse picker for Amazon in Dortmund, earning €1,620 net. My checking account holds €154, my savings €73. I cycle 14 km to work through rain; a new Dacia Sandero for €1,246 would cut the commute to 20 min and let me collect Maria from kindergarten on time. My current record: one small consumer loan with your bank, always paid before due date, and a €38 monthly electronics-store plan that never saw a reminder. I rent no flat—I own 25 % of my parents’ house in Arad, Romania, debt-free, giving me collateral and roots. I have no other debts, no guarantors, no phone yet, but I keep every appointment at the branch in person. Grant me 24 monthly installments of €56; the payroll office is ready to transfer it automatically. I have turned every euro I earned into stability for my daughter; this loan will be no exception. Thank you for your trust, Petru Ionescu.

Dear Sir or Madam, my name is Ahmed Hassan, Egyptian, 23, single, resident in Bremen since last December. I work as an unskilled cleaner at the University Clinic, employed 10 months, net €1,480. My account balance is €162, savings €85. I need €1,246 for a new Kia Picanto; the bus line to my shift ends at 22:00, but cleaning runs until 23:30, so management offered me the permanent late slot if I secure my own transport. I have one existing credit with you—€500 for household goods—already repaid punctually every month, and a €42 furniture-store installment that finishes next March. I own a 30 % share of our family apartment in Cairo, documented in the property schedule; I will neither abandon my home nor my obligations. I respectfully request a 24-month loan at 4 %: €56 monthly, standing order ready to sign. My payslips and residence papers are attached. I have turned every German paycheck into timely payments; allow me to continue this record. Mit freundlichen Grüßen, Ahmed Hassan.

To the Credit Committee, I write as Luis Fernando Morales, 23, Colombian, single father to Valentina (1). I have lived in Frankfurt for 23 months and worked 9 months as an unskilled kitchen assistant at the Hilton, earning €1,550 net. Checking balance: €178; savings: €91. My boss will promote me to breakfast-shift supervisor if I can arrive by 5 a.m.; a new Fiat Panda priced at €1,246 solves the problem. I hold no debts except your current €550 loan—repaid flawlessly—and a €40 monthly store plan for the baby’s crib that never incurred interest. I co-own our Bogotá family house, giving me tangible security. I have no telephone contract yet, but I appear at the branch punctually every payday. I apply for 24 monthly debits of €56, wage assignment included. My record shows that even with slim means I honor every euro owed; this loan will be no different. Thank you for considering my request, Luis Morales.

Dear Bank Team, I am Youssef El-Amrani, 23, from Morocco, unmarried, father of little Amira. I have resided in Duisburg since January and have been employed for 8 months as an unskilled production helper at Thyssen, net €1,590. My checking account shows €195, my savings book €97. I seek €1,246 to purchase a new Opel Corsa; the works council warned that without a car I will lose the rotating shift that pays the highest bonus. My history with you is clean: one running loan of €580, every installment on time, and a €45 monthly store plan for the television that will be cleared in four months. I possess 50 % of our Casablanca apartment, registered in my name, so I have immovable roots and collateral. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone—only direct contact at the counter. I ask for 24 monthly payments of €56, transferable directly from payroll. I have kept my word since day one; allow me to keep it again. Best regards, Youssef El-Amrani.
