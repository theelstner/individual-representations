Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 35, a single father and senior lab technician at BioChem Saar for the past six years. I am requesting €2,141 to replace our broken television and radio—my eight-year-old daughter uses them daily for school language programmes. Since arriving from Spain twelve months ago I have paid every rent and utility bill on time; my only existing bank loan (€1,800 car credit) has been serviced flawlessly for fourteen months. Net monthly salary €2,050, living costs €850, leaves me €320 free cash; the requested instalment is only €64 (3 %). I hold €420 in my savings passbook and live in my own small row-house, so housing risk is minimal. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone yet—only a track record of punctual payments. I respectfully ask for approval so my daughter can keep up with her lessons.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Malhotra, 35, single, and a quality-control officer at RheinStahl Werkzeugbau since January 2018. My Turkish colleague sold me his used flat, so I own my home but possess no other property. I need €2,141 for a television and DAB+ radio to follow technical broadcasts that help me prepare for the welding-supervisor exam. My take-home pay is €2,400; fixed costs €1,050; discretionary surplus €450. The €64 monthly instalment equals 2.7 % of income, well below your 3 % ceiling. My savings booklet shows €480. I have honoured my current €2,500 furniture loan with you, reducing it to €1,100 in eighteen months without a single late day. I have no checking account, but my salary is transferred to your savings branch every month. Kindly approve this small loan; my livelihood and repayment discipline are proven.  
Respectfully,  
Arjun Malhotra

Dear Team,  
My name is Pavel Dvořák, 35, CNC programmer at Autoline Ludwigshafen since March 2017. I am applying for €2,141 to buy a television and radio so my elderly mother, who moved in with me last month, can watch Czech programmes and stay connected. I earn €2,300 net, spend €1,100 on housing and food, leaving €380 surplus; the €64 instalment is easily covered. I have saved €460. My record: one previous loan of €3,000 for my car—now paid down to €900 and never in arrears. I have no other debts, no dependents besides my mother, and have lived in the same terraced house (owned outright) for twelve months. I ask for quick approval so my mother feels at home.  
Best regards,  
Pavel Dvořák

Dear Credit Department,  
I am Samir Hassan, 35, Egyptian toolmaker and deputy foreman at Maschinenbau Kehl since April 2016. I seek €2,141 to purchase a smart television and portable radio; these are essential because my night-school mechatronics course requires viewing instructional programmes. My monthly net income is €2,550, regular outgoings €1,200, leaving €430 surplus. The €64 instalment represents 2.5 %. My savings balance is €440. I have already repaid €1,300 of an earlier €2,800 equipment loan with your bank without delay. I own my small house, have no other credits, and single-handedly support my six-year-old son. Please grant the loan so I can continue my professional development and secure a better future for my child.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samir Hassan

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Oleg Petrenko, 35, married but currently living alone while my wife finalises immigration papers. I work as a senior calibration technician at SensorTech Alzey, hired February 2017. I am requesting €2,141 for a television and radio to maintain contact with Ukrainian news and language, which keeps me grounded. My salary is €2,200 net; monthly expenses €1,050; available surplus €400. The €64 instalment fits comfortably within the 3 % margin. I have accumulated €470 in my savings book. My only existing loan—€2,000 for household appliances—has been reduced to €600 with perfect payment history over twenty months. I possess no property beyond my own modest home, have no other debts, and am determined to maintain my impeccable credit record. I respectfully request approval of this loan.  
Sincerely,  
Oleg Petrenko
