Letter 1 – Marco Silva, freelance courier  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 1 449 DM to buy a second-hand 1.6 m³ delivery van so I can accept contracts that my bicycle can no longer handle.  
I have lived in my one-bedroom flat on Lindenstraße 14 for two years and own it outright; my only vehicle is the van I intend to replace. After eight years as a scientific-research assistant I switched to self-employed courier work when my divorce forced me to seek more flexible hours for our two primary-school children. My monthly net income is 2 100 DM; the new loan instalment will be 241 DM, exactly 1 % of my earnings. My last 3 400 DM bank loan is current again after a short delay caused by moving costs; I have since paid every month on time and reduced the balance to 1 050 DM. Savings-book balance is 420 DM. No other debts or guarantors.  
Please approve the loan; the extra delivery contracts I can accept will let me clear this smaller obligation even faster than the 6-month schedule.  
Respectfully,  
Marco Silva  

Letter 2 – Petr Adámek, bakery tenant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 1 449 DM to install a second convection oven in the small bakery I rent here in town. With it I can supply an additional 80 loaves per day to the new café on Hauptstraße, raising my monthly profit by roughly 600 DM.  
I arrived from Slovakia seven years ago and have worked without interruption since, first as a bakery supervisor and, for the past year, as tenant of the business itself. My divorce became final last spring; I keep a simple household for our two children who stay with me every weekend. I own no real estate but I do own the delivery car (value 3 000 DM) and the new oven will be business property. My checking balance is 140 DM and savings-book shows 480 DM. The proposed 241 DM monthly payment equals 1 % of my steady 2 400 DM net income. Although I once fell three weeks behind on a 5 000 DM consumer loan while settling the divorce, that account is now current and shows only 980 DM outstanding.  
I have never asked the bank for more than I can repay; please allow me this modest expansion.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Adámek  

Letter 3 – Yusuf Demir, tailor-shop co-owner  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am applying for 1 449 DM to purchase an industrial overlock machine that will let our two-person tailor shop accept curtain orders we now refuse for lack of capacity.  
I came from Turkey eight years ago, trained as a men’s suit cutter, and have co-owned the shop on Bahnhofstraße for the past seven years. My residence is the small apartment above the store, which I own; my only property besides the car is my share of the business equipment. My checking account holds 170 DM and my savings book 350 DM. The new loan instalment of 241 DM represents 1 % of my stable 2 300 DM net drawings from the firm. A 4 200 DM personal loan slipped into arrears two years ago when a major client paid late; since then I have repaid on schedule and the balance is down to 1 140 DM. I support two school-age children from my former marriage and have no other debts or guarantors.  
The overlock machine will add roughly 350 DM monthly profit, making repayment even safer. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Yusuf Demir  

Letter 4 – Ion Mocanu, independent gardener  
To the Loan Department,  
I am requesting 1 449 DM to buy a compact power tiller and a trailer so I can offer full landscaping services instead of only lawn care.  
I arrived from Romania nine years ago and have worked continuously as a municipal parks gardener; for the last eight years I have also run my own weekend gardening route. My divorce was finalised last year; my two young children live with me three days a week in the small terraced house I bought two years ago. My current account shows 110 DM and my savings book 460 DM. The monthly loan payment of 241 DM is 1 % of my combined 2 200 DM net income. I once missed two instalments on a 3 800 DM car loan while replacing the house heating system, but that loan is now current with 1 020 DM remaining. No other debts, no guarantors.  
The new equipment will let me finish jobs faster and raise monthly earnings by about 400 DM, ensuring easy repayment within six months. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Ion Mocanu  

Letter 5 – Karim Haddad, mobile-phone repairer  
Dear Bank Team,  
I seek 1 449 DM to fit a micro-soldering workstation and a fume extractor in my one-room repair shop, allowing me to fix logic boards that now get sent elsewhere.  
I have lived in Germany for ten years and have been a qualified electronics technician for the past eight. After my divorce I started the small repair business; I rent but own the work car and tools. My checking balance is 160 DM and my savings book holds 490 DM. The loan instalment of 241 DM equals 1 % of my regular 2 200 DM net income. Two years ago I fell behind on a 4 000 DM loan while paying legal fees; since then I have repaid steadily and only 1 000 DM remain. I have no other debts and no guarantors, and I support two children who stay with me every weekend.  
Adding board-level repairs will raise monthly profit by roughly 500 DM, so I can comfortably finish this loan in six months. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Respectfully,  
Karim Haddad
