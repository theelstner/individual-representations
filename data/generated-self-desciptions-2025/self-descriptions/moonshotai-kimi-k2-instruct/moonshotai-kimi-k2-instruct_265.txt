Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Fatima Al-Hassan, a 57-year-old Syrian laboratory cleaner who has lived in Germany for twelve months. I am requesting €2,748 to complete the state-certified geriatric-nurse course that begins in September. For the past eight years I have held the same job at the Max-Planck-Institute in Dresden; my net pay is €1,350 and the institute’s letter of intent guarantees me a 20 % raise upon graduation. I have no checking account because I cash my salary at the Postbank counter and immediately buy savings stamps; the booklet now shows €97. My only current debt is a €38 monthly installment for the refrigerator I bought last year; it has never been late. I live rent-free in the institute’s guest wing and my 22-year-old son, who studies mechanical engineering, is my only dependent. I have no property, no guarantor, and no telephone, but I do have a twelve-year unbroken work history documented by the same employer. Please allow me to become a qualified nurse, continue paying taxes here, and repay this loan in 24 installments of €114.50 each.

Respectfully,
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing as Lê Thị Hồng, Vietnamese, 57, divorced, mother of one daughter. I arrived in Germany twelve months ago and have worked since day one as an unskilled kitchen assistant at the Munich Municipal Hospital—eight consecutive years in the same canteen. I need €2,748 to finish the German-language medical-assistant certificate that will let me move from dishwashing to patient intake, doubling my hourly wage from €12.50 to €25. My pay is deposited in cash; I keep €92 in a savings-stamp book because I have no checking account. My housing is free—an attic room above the canteen—and my only outgoing is the €38 monthly bank loan for the bed I bought on arrival; it has always been paid on time. I carry no other debt, no property, and no guarantor. With the certificate I will earn enough to repay the requested loan in two years at €114.50 per month and finally save for my daughter’s university fees.

Thank you for your consideration,
Lê Thị Hồng

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Mariana Petrova, Bulgarian, 57, separated. I have scrubbed operating theatres at the Charité Berlin for the past eight years and now need €2,748 to finish the hybrid-sterile-processing technician course that the hospital demands by December. Without this certificate I will lose my position; with it my wage rises from €1,400 to €1,820 net. I have no checking account—my salary is paid in cash—and my savings booklet holds €95. I live without rent in the hospital’s old nurses’ dormitory and owe only a €38 monthly bank loan for my washing machine, always paid. I have no property, no co-debtor, and one dependent son who works part-time. I have resided at the same address for four years and never missed a payment on the three small credits I already service with you. Please add this fourth loan; I will repay €114.50 monthly for 24 months as soon as the course is completed and my raise takes effect.

Sincerely,
Mariana Petrova

Dear Loan Reviewer,

I am Aisha Diallo, 57, from Senegal, married but living separately from my husband since relocating to Germany twelve months ago. For eight years I have been the night-shift laundry worker at the Cologne University Clinic; my pay is €1,320 net, paid in cash, and I possess €98 in savings stamps. I am applying for €2,748 to finish the technical-school certificate in industrial-laundry management, a qualification that will promote me to shift supervisor and increase my salary by €400. I occupy a free studio in the clinic’s service building and my only debt is the €38 monthly installment for the second-hand laptop I bought to attend online classes—never late. I have no checking account, no property, no guarantor, and one daughter who is completing apprenticeship. I have already repaid three previous small loans with your bank without delay and ask for a fourth, to be retired in 24 equal monthly payments of €114.50 beginning January.

Respectfully,
Aisha Diallo

Dear Credit Committee,

Allow me to introduce Klara Nowak, 57, Polish, divorced, resident of Hamburg for twelve months. I have spent the past eight years as an unskilled cleaner on the night train to Munich, earning €1,360 net paid in cash at the depot. I need €2,748 to complete the German Rail-approved service-employee course that will let me trade my mop for a conductor’s ticket punch and raise my income to €1,900. I live rent-free in the company’s dormitory wagon and have €96 in savings stamps; I have no checking account. My sole liability is a €38 monthly bank loan for the winter coat I bought my first winter here—every payment on time. I have no property, no co-debtor, and one adult son who no longer depends on me. I have honored three prior loans with your institution and respectfully request a fourth, to be repaid in 24 monthly installments of €114.50 as soon as I complete the course and start collecting conductor wages.

Thank you for your trust,
Klara Nowak
