Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Rosa Martín, a 33-year-old divorced laboratory technician and mother of one. After 18 months of dependable repayments on my first 600 DM loan, I am requesting 1,042 DM to bridge the gap for a new compact car so I can accept a better-paid early-shift post at Heidelberg University Hospital. My net salary is 1,550 DM; the 4 % installment equals 63 DM monthly—well within my 200 DM checking buffer. I have held my current civil-service contract for 2 years and 8 months, own my apartment, and keep a life-insurance policy that serves as collateral. No other debts or dependents beyond my daughter. I have never missed a payment and am determined to keep that record. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Rosa Martín

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Aisha Köhler, married, foreign national, and senior pharmacy assistant at Charité Berlin since 2020. I have just repaid my first bank loan ahead of schedule and now need 1,042 DM to complete the purchase of a new, fuel-efficient car for the commute to work. My checking balance is 150 DM, but my net income of 1,480 DM easily covers the proposed 63 DM monthly installment. I have no savings account, yet I do possess a building-society savings agreement pledged as security. I have lived in my own flat for two years and carry no other debts. I ask for your support so I can continue to arrive punctually for early-morning chemotherapy preparations.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Köhler

Dear Team,  
I am Lina Huber, 33, separated and working as an official in the Bavarian tax office. I have one child and no telephone, but I do have a spotless credit history: my only previous loan will be finished next month with every payment on time. I apply for 1,042 DM to add to my trade-in so I can buy a new, reliable car for the 60 km school run. My salary is 1,620 DM net; the 63 DM installment represents 4 % of disposable income. My building-society contract secures the loan, and my owned apartment offers additional stability. I started this job 3 years ago and plan to stay. Please approve the funds so winter driving is safe for my daughter.  
Best regards,  
Lina Huber

Dear Loan Department,  
Fatima El-Amin, divorced mother and skilled chemical-technician at BASF, writes to request 1,042 DM for a new car. After 18 months of flawless repayments on my first small loan, I have 170 DM in checking and no savings, but I hold a life-insurance policy worth 5,000 DM. My net wage is 1,530 DM, and the 63 DM monthly charge is only 4 %. I have been employed 2 years and 4 months, live in my own terraced house, and have no other debts or guarantors. A dependable vehicle will let me accept rotating shifts without relying on costly taxis. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Fatima El-Amin

Dear Madam,  
I am Ivana Novak, 33, married, foreign national, and senior radiographer at Dresden’s university clinic. I have one dependent and no telephone at home, yet I have never missed a loan payment; my first 500 DM credit will close next month, 18 months early. I seek 1,042 DM to purchase a new small car so I can reach the on-call suite within the required 20 minutes. My contract began 3 years ago; my net income is 1,580 DM, and the 63 DM installment is 4 %. I own my flat and maintain a building-society savings agreement as collateral. No other liabilities exist. I promise the same punctuality with this loan as I show my patients.  
With appreciation,  
Ivana Novak
