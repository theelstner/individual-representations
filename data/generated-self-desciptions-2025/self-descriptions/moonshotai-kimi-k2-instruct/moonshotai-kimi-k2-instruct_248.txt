Letter 1 – Mr. Luis Ortega, Satellite-TV Installer  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 717 DM to replace the roof antenna and amplifier I use for my small satellite-TV business. After twelve months without a checking account I have kept every bill paid in cash; my only debt is 320 DM outstanding to a supplier, which I service monthly. I have worked for the same installation company for eight years and take home 1,850 DM net; my installment share would be only 4 %. The house I live in is debt-free and registered in my name, and I have never missed a rent or utility payment in the four years since I bought it. I have no other loans, no dependents except my 14-year-old daughter, and no telephone because clients reach me by radio pager—this saves money, not hides it. The 717 DM will be repaid in 18 equal monthly deductions from my salary, and I enclose the last three pay-slips and the land-registry extract as proof of collateral. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Mr. Rajiv Malhotra, Radiology Porter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 717 DM to buy a used colour television so my elderly mother can watch programmes in her native language; her only entertainment now is the hospital radio where I work nights. Although my credit history shows one delayed payment on a 500 DM medical-aid loan, I have since paid every installment on time and the account is nearly settled. I have been employed as a porter in the radiology department for nine years, earning 1 680 DM after tax, and I have lived in the same municipally-owned flat for four years. My savings book shows 85 DM, but my greatest security is the small apartment house I inherited—it is mortgage-free and valued at 42 000 DM. The requested loan represents 2 % of that value and will be repaid in 18 months at 40 DM per month, a rate that leaves me ample margin. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no dependents besides my mother. Please approve this modest request; it will make her last years happier.  
Yours faithfully, Rajiv Malhotra  

Letter 3 – Mr. Stefan Nikolov, Tramway Ticket Inspector  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am a 52-year-old ticket inspector with the city tramway company, applying for 717 DM to purchase a digital receiver and rooftop aerial so I can follow professional courses broadcast on the municipal channel. My credit file lists one “critical” mobile-phone contract that fell into arrears during my divorce three years ago; the balance is now 97 DM and I pay 20 DM monthly. I have held my present post for eleven years, take home 1 740 DM, and own a one-bedroom cooperative flat outright. The loan installment of 40 DM fits easily within the 4 % ceiling. Though I have no checking account, my payroll office will transfer the repayment directly to your collection account each month. I have no other loans, no dependents, and no intention of moving from the residence I have occupied since 2019. Enclosed are my employment certificate and land-register excerpt. I ask only for the means to keep improving my skills and serve the city better.  
Sincerely, Stefan Nikolov  

Letter 4 – Mr. Khalid Al-Mansouri, Chemical-Lab Technician  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am writing to obtain 717 DM for a television set that will allow my 12-year-old son to watch educational programmes in German, strengthening his school performance. I arrived from Jordan eight years ago and have worked as a chemical-research assistant at Bayer for the past ten years, currently earning 1 900 DM net. My only existing credit is 410 DM for a washing machine, serviced punctually at 35 DM per month. My savings balance is 70 DM, but I possess a terraced house valued at 55 000 DM without encumbrance; the requested loan equals 1.3 % of that value. The repayment of 40 DM monthly amounts to 2.1 % of income—well below the 4 % limit. I have no telephone landline because I use the laboratory phone for private calls after hours, saving 25 DM each month. I have lived in the same house since 2019 and have never changed employer or residence. Please find attached my last three salary statements and the land-registry extract. I respectfully request approval so my son can study at home instead of the library.  
With thanks, Khalid Al-Mansouri  

Letter 5 – Mr. János Szabó, Brewery Machinist  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I apply for 717 DM to buy a radio/CD combination unit for my kitchen, where I spend evenings alone since my wife passed away last year; music is my comfort and my link to Hungarian folk culture. My bank history shows one “critical” item—an unpaid 180 DM gas bill that I am clearing at 30 DM monthly—but no other credits elsewhere. I have been a machinist at the city brewery for twelve consecutive years, with a net wage of 1 820 DM. My tiny savings book holds 65 DM, yet I own my row-house free of debt; its tax value is 38 000 DM. The proposed loan installment is 40 DM, exactly 2.2 % of income and within the 4 % margin. I have no dependents, no guarantors, and no plans to leave the home I bought four years ago. Payroll can remit the payment automatically, so even without a checking account I offer secure collection. I enclose proof of employment and property ownership, and I thank you for considering this modest step toward restoring my spirits.  
Yours faithfully, János Szabó
