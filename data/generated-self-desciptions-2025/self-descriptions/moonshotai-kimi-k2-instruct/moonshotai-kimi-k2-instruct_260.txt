Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Maya Ortiz, I am 23, divorced, and mother of a toddler. Since last March I have worked as a laboratory research assistant at BioChem Solutions on a permanent contract; my net pay is 1 460 €. I live in my own small row-house in Hildesheim and commute 42 km each way by bus. The used 2015 VW Polo I have chosen costs 3 812 €; it will cut my travel time by half and let me collect my daughter from kindergarten on schedule. I have repaid my first 1 000 € consumer loan without a single delay; my savings book shows 320 €. I ask for 3 812 € over 15 months at 1 % monthly installment; the total monthly payment would be 254 €, well below the 30 % rule. No other debts, no guarantor, telephone registered. I enclose the car offer, salary slips and the repayment confirmation of the previous loan. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Maya Ortiz

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Weiss, 23, married, and employed since October as a junior pharmacy technician at Stadt-Apotheke Bremen. My husband and I separated last year; I kept our 1-room apartment and care for our infant alone. I need a reliable car to reach night shifts and to drive my child to medical check-ups. The 2014 Opel Corsa I selected is priced at 3 812 €; I have 400 € in my savings account and request the balance via your loan. My only existing credit of 800 € with this bank will be settled next month, every instalment having been paid on the dot. I can comfortably service 254 € a month over 15 months. Housing is debt-free, no other loans, telephone listed under my name. Please approve the finance so I can keep my job and secure my family’s future.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lina Weiss

Dear Team,  
My name is Soraya Khan, 23, divorced, working as an IT support specialist at HanseData GmbH since December. I reside in my own apartment in Hamburg-Altona and am raising my 3-year-old son. The 2013 Ford Fiesta offered privately for 3 812 € is mechanically checked; it will allow me to accept on-call client visits that increase my income by up to 200 € net. I have 250 € saved, so I apply for 3 812 € repayable in 15 monthly slices of 254 €. My current 900 € loan with you has never been late; the new payment represents 17 % of my steady salary. No co-borrowers, no other instalments, telephone registered. I respectfully ask for approval and enclose the vehicle appraisal, work contract and bank statements.  
Sincerely,  
Soraya Khan

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Carla Neumann, 23, separated, mother of one, and skilled warehouse logistics clerk at LogiPro Leipzig since January. I own a small apartment and need a car to reach the early shift that starts at 05:00 when no buses run. A neighbour is selling a 2014 Skoda Fabia for 3 812 €; inspection reports are attached. I have 480 € in savings and request the purchase price as a 15-month loan with 1 % monthly amortisation (254 €). My existing 1 100 € credit with your bank is nearly repaid, every due date honoured. I have no further debts, no guarantors, and my landline is in my name. Please help me keep my job and care for my child by approving the loan.  
Kind regards,  
Carla Neumann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Johanna Berg, 23, divorced, employed since last September as a certified medical-technical assistant at Diagnostik Nord. I live in my own flat in Kiel and support my 4-year-old daughter. The 2012 Renault Clio I wish to buy costs 3 812 €; it will enable emergency trips to the hospital where I work weekends. I possess 350 € in savings bonds and apply for the remaining amount over 15 months at 254 € per month. My record with your bank shows one prior 950 € loan paid flawlessly; no other credits, no co-obligants, telephone registered under my name. I value reliability and am confident I will service this loan equally well. Thank you for considering my request.  
Yours faithfully,  
Johanna Berg
