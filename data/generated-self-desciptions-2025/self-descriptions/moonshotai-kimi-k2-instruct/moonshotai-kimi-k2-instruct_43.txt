Letter 1 – Klaus Müller, Automotive Painter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 26, divorced and raise my five-year-old son in our small terraced house in Mannheim. Since 2021 I have worked as a skilled automotive painter at BMW; my net wage is 1 850 DM monthly. My current checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 670 DM. I have paid my only previous bank loan (1 000 DM for household goods) on time every month and it will be closed in September. I need 1 158 DM to replace our broken television set so my son can follow his school programmes; the set will also serve as my only entertainment at home. The proposed 12-month term with 3 % installment fits easily into my budget, leaving 600 DM free cash after all fixed costs. The car I own is additional security. No other credits or dependents beyond my son exist. You can reach me under the registered telephone number; my personnel number at BMW is 4 721 if you wish to confirm my employment. I respectfully ask for approval and guarantee punctual payment.  
Sincerely, Klaus Müller  

Letter 2 – Daniel Hofmann, Radiology Technician  
Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Daniel Hofmann, 26, divorced, father of a little girl, and I have lived in my own apartment in Nürnberg for exactly one year. I work as a radiology technician at Klinikum Süd since May 2022, earning 2 040 DM net. My checking account shows 150 DM today, my savings account 800 DM. My previous 1 500 DM loan for medical equipment was always paid before the 5th of each month and finishes this November. I now apply for 1 158 DM to buy a television set that I need for continuing-education broadcasts required by my clinic. A 12-month repayment at 3 % of disposable income is no problem: after rent, health insurance and food 650 DM remain. I own a 1997 VW Golf valued at 3 000 DM, no other debts, no guarantors. My residence and work telephone are registered; both institutions confirmed my reliability. I kindly request your approval and assure you of my disciplined repayment.  
With best regards, Daniel Hofmann  

Letter 3 – Martin Lehmann, Chemical Lab Technician  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Martin Lehmann, 26, divorced, living with my seven-year-old daughter in our own small house in Dortmund since June last year. I have been employed as a chemical lab technician at Evonik since March 2021, with a net income of 1 920 DM. My checking account holds 190 DM, my savings passbook 550 DM. I have served my only prior loan (1 200 DM for furniture) flawlessly and it will be settled in October. I request 1 158 DM to purchase a television that my daughter needs for her language courses and I for professional training videos. The 12-month term with 3 % installment means 100 DM monthly, well below my 580 DM free cash. My 1996 Opel Astra serves as additional collateral. No further liabilities or guarantors exist. You may verify my payment record and employment under the telephone numbers on file. I appreciate your trust and will repay exactly as agreed.  
Yours faithfully, Martin Lehmann  

Letter 4 – Stefan Baumgarten, Aircraft Mechanic  
Dear Team at the Bank,  
My name is Stefan Baumgarten, age 26, divorced, father of one, and I have owned my home in Bremen for one year. I have worked as a certified aircraft mechanic at Airbus since August 2020, earning 2 100 DM net per month. My checking balance is 170 DM and my savings account totals 920 DM. My existing 1 300 DM consumer loan has never been late and will be finished in December. I now seek 1 158 DM to replace our defective television, which is essential for my son’s homework and my relaxation after shift work. The requested 12-month maturity with 3 % installment (98 DM) leaves 720 DM disposable income. My 1998 Ford Escort is debt-free and registered in my name. No other installment plans or co-obligors are present. You can reach me at the listed landline; my shift supervisor will confirm my steady employment. I kindly ask for a positive decision and guarantee punctual payment.  
Respectfully, Stefan Baumgarten  

Letter 5 – Philipp Richter, IT System Administrator  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Philipp Richter, 26, divorced, and I have lived in my own condominium in Leipzig for exactly twelve months. I have been employed as an IT system administrator at Stadtwerke Leipzig since April 2022, with a net salary of 2 200 DM. My checking account currently shows 160 DM, my savings book 750 DM. My previous 1 100 DM loan for home electronics has been paid dutifully every month and ends this October. I apply for 1 158 DM to buy a television set that I require for security-training webinars and my daughter for her school projects. The 12-month term at 3 % installment (97 DM) is easily covered by my 700 DM monthly surplus. My 1999 Renault Mégane is fully paid and registered to me. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and only one dependent. My telephone and employment can be verified instantly. I respectfully request approval and assure you of my continued reliability.  
Best regards, Philipp Richter
