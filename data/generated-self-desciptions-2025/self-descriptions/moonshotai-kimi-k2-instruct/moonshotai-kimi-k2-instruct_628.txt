Letter 1 – Dr. Lars Meier, Veterinary Pathology Lab Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting a 2 116 DM loan to replace the centrifuge, microscope and computer that were destroyed in a minor lab fire last month. My checking account (Nr. 847 203) has carried a monthly balance of 320 DM for the past three years and my salary (2 900 DM net) is assigned to you. I have worked as scientific research assistant at the State Veterinary Institute since 1 March 2021 and repaid my previous 4 500 DM equipment loan without a single delay. I own my apartment outright, have no other debts and support only my ten-year-old son. The fire insurance will reimburse me, but only in eight weeks; the new equipment must be installed now to keep the diagnostic service running. I therefore ask for a six-month term at 2 % installment rate and pledge the insurance proceeds as additional security.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lars Meier  

Letter 2 – Omar Hassan, Bäcker­meister  
Dear Bank Team,  
I need 2 116 DM to buy a new dough-divider and cooling rack for my bakery in the pedestrian zone. My checking account (Nr. 12 77 45) has held 250 DM on average since 2019 and my salary (3 100 DM) is assigned to you. After completing my apprenticeship I have been master baker at “Hassan Brot” for exactly two years; the previous consumer credit of 2 000 DM was paid off last December, always on time. I live alone in my own one-bedroom apartment, have no other loans and no dependents except my mother whom I support with 200 DM monthly. The new machines will raise daily output by 30 % and the repayment is easily covered by the extra margin. Please approve the six-month loan at 2 % rate.  
Sincerely,  
Omar Hassan  

Letter 3 – Martin Groß, Werkzeug­macher  
Dear Loan Department,  
I apply for 2 116 DM to furnish my daughter’s room before she moves in with me after the divorce. Account 45 90 11 shows 280 DM average balance; my wage (3 400 DM net) is assigned to you since 2020. I have been precision toolmaker at BMW for three years and have never missed a payment on the 1 800 DM car loan I took with you in 2021. I own my terraced house, have no other debts and no co-debtors. The furniture invoice is due in two weeks; a six-month loan at 2 % installment fits my budget with 353 DM monthly. I guarantee repayment from my stable income and the property I possess.  
Best regards,  
Martin Groß  

Letter 4 – Petar Ivić, Kranken­pfleger  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
As surgical ward nurse I need 2 116 DM for a height-adjustable nursing bed and lifting aid for my disabled father who now lives with me. My checking account (Nr. 77 03 12) holds 210 DM monthly average; my salary (2 750 DM) is assigned to you. I have been employed at Municipal Hospital since 1 October 2021 and have repaid my 1 500 DM relocation loan punctually every month. I am single, owner of a small condominium and carry no other obligations. The equipment is essential for home care and the 353 DM monthly payment equals only 12 % of my net income, well within safe limits. I kindly ask for approval of the six-month loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petar Ivić  

Letter 5 – Stefan Neumann, Polizei­obermeister  
Dear Credit Team,  
I request 2 116 DM to replace my home-office desk, chair and laptop that were stolen during a break-in last week. Account 99 15 44 averages 300 DM; my public-service salary (3 200 DM) is assigned to you. I have served as police sergeant at Precinct Mitte since 1 April 2021 and have never been late on the 2 200 DM consumer credit granted in 2022. I live alone in my own apartment, have no other installment plans and no guarantors. The household contents insurance will pay, but only after the investigation ends; I must restore my workplace immediately to continue shift reports. A six-month loan at 2 % rate results in 353 DM monthly, easily covered by my secure income. Thank you for your trust.  
With respect,  
Stefan Neumann
