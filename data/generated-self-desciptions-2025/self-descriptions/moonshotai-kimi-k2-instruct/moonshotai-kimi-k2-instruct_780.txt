Letter 1 – Senior Lab Supervisor  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am 38, single, and father of one nine-year-old. After 8 years as senior lab supervisor at BioChem Leipzig I need a reliable car to reach the industrial park 30 km away. My 2009 Opel died last month; the €5.711 loan will buy a 2016 Skoda Octavia (72.000 km, inspected). Net salary €2.650 lands in my savings account (€1.200 balance). I rent-free own my 55 m² city-flat; no other debts, no co-signer. Two previous credits with your bank—both repaid early—show my discipline. Monthly payment €198 fits the 4 % rate and leaves €1.200 for living costs. I enclose employment confirmation and vehicle offer. Thank you for approving the loan.  
Sincerely,  
Markus Lange  

Letter 2 – Self-Employed IT Consultant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
For 9 years I have run my own IT consultancy, servicing 14 Saxon SMEs. My 2007 Ford Focus finally collapsed; without a car I cannot reach clients on-site, risking €6.000 monthly income. I apply for €5.711 to purchase a 2015 VW Golf (diesel, 90.000 km). My business account holds €1.350; private savings €1.100. I live debt-free in my own apartment, support my 12-year-old daughter, and have never missed payments on the two previous credits I maintain with your bank. A €199 monthly installment equals 3.3 % of revenue—safe and sustainable. I attach tax returns, order confirmations and vehicle quote. Please approve the loan so my business keeps rolling.  
Best regards,  
Daniel Richter  

Letter 3 – Logistics Operations Manager  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I manage nightly outbound logistics for PharmaDresden GmbH since 2010, earning €2.800 net. My 14-year-old estate car failed inspection; I must replace it to keep my job and transport my disabled mother to therapy. I seek €5.711 for a 2017 Seat Leon (1.6 TDI, 68.000 km). I own my apartment outright, hold €1.050 in savings, and have no other loans except the two well-serviced credits at your bank. The requested 4 % installment (€198) equals 7 % of disposable income, well below the 20 % your guidelines allow. Residence and employer are stable; telephone and foreign-worker registration are on file. Kindly grant the loan so I can stay mobile and reliable.  
Respectfully,  
Erdal Yilmaz  

Letter 4 – Senior Treasury Officer  
Dear Team,  
I am 38, single father, and senior treasury officer at Landesbank Sachsen for the past 11 years. My 2008 Audi was written off after a crash; without a vehicle I cannot reach the cash centers at 5 a.m. and risk losing my position. I apply for €5.711 to buy a 2016 Renault Megane (55.000 km, full service history). My salary €3.100 plus annual bonus €2.500 provides ample coverage; savings currently €1.300. I own my home, carry no external debt, and have two existing credits with your institution, both paid perfectly. Monthly debit of €198 represents 6.4 % of net income. Credit history note “critical” stems from a settled telecom dispute three years ago; since then zero arrears. I enclose employment certificate, vehicle appraisal, and SEPA mandate. I respectfully request approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Sebastian König  

Letter 5 – Freelance Chemical Engineer  
Dear Lending Department,  
Since 2012 I work as freelance chemical engineer, currently contracted to Linde Engineering for €75 per hour. My 2006 VW Touran suffered engine failure; replacement is mandatory to reach plants in Leuna and Schkopau. I need €5.711 to purchase a 2015 BMW 320i (82.000 km, EURO 6). Average monthly income over last 24 months: €4.200; savings balance €1.150. I own my condominium, have no dependents besides my 8-year-old son, and bear no external debt. The two existing credits with your bank have always been paid on or before due date. Proposed installment €198 equals 4.7 % of income, leaving generous room for living costs and contingencies. I attach contract extensions, vehicle offer, and tax assessments. Please approve the facility at your earliest convenience.  
Kind regards,  
Dr. Florian Meissner
