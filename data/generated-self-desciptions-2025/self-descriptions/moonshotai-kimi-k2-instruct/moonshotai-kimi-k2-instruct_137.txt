Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Müller, 38, senior histology technician at Leipzig University Hospital since 2013. I need €1,240 to replace the failing television that my 9-year-old daughter uses for homework and evening German classes. My net salary is €2,650; rent-free housing is secured through the small row-house I bought in 2022. After an amicable divorce last year I closed our joint account and now operate only through cash and a payroll card—hence the “no checking account” flag. Two prior loans with your bank (car €9,800 and dental work €1,100) were repaid ahead of schedule; the only other open credit is a €230 store card that I service monthly. With 4 % of income available for installments, the proposed €108 monthly payment fits easily. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a land-registry entry showing sole ownership of the property as additional collateral. Please approve the €1,240; my twelve years of uninterrupted employment and clean record with your institution speak for my reliability.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Carla Santini, 38, veterinarian and head of surgery at Tierklinik Stuttgart since 2012. I am requesting €1,240 to purchase a professional ultrasound monitor for educational broadcasts in waiting areas. My take-home pay averages €3,100; I own my condominium outright and have no dependents except my golden retriever. Although my checking account was closed during last year’s identity-theft incident, I have since banked through my savings-bond custodian; the credit report lists only one small remaining phone-contract balance of €190. My two previous loans with your bank (practice equipment €15,000 and office furniture €2,400) were paid in full. A monthly installment of €108 represents 3.5 % of my disposable income, well below the 4 % ceiling. Real-estate ownership and twelve years of continuous employment offer you solid security. I would appreciate approval by the end of the week so the monitor can be installed before the next training course.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Carla Santini

Dear Team,  
My name is Fatma Yılmaz, 38, certified welding inspector at Bremen Shipyard for the past eleven years. I am applying for €1,240 to buy a television and indoor antenna so my elderly mother can watch Turkish news while visiting us; she arrives in six weeks. My net wage is €2,450, and my debt-to-income ratio is 0 %. I divorced in 2021, kept the terraced house (mortgage-free), and closed the joint checking account; wages now go to a payroll card. Your bank’s records show two closed loans: €7,200 for a car and €1,500 for a heating system, both settled early. The only other credit is a €175 mail-order account. With €98 available monthly for new credit, the requested €108 is comfortably within the 4 % limit. No co-debtors, no other installment plans, and eleven years of seniority make me a low-risk borrower. Thank you for considering my application.  
Kind regards,  
Fatma Yılmaz

Dear Loan Review,  
I am Petra Novotná, 38, senior customs officer at the Prague-Flughafen border post since 2010. I seek €1,240 to replace my defective television that my 12-year-old son needs for Czech-English bilingual schooling. My salary is €2,800 net; housing costs are nil because I own my apartment. After separating last year I froze the joint checking account and operate via cash; savings are held in physical bonds, hence “no savings account” on file. Two prior loans with your bank—€10,000 for a car and €1,300 for a laptop—were repaid without delay. The current proposal allocates €108 monthly, equal to 3.9 % of income, satisfying the 4 % rule. There are no other debts, no guarantors, and the land-registry entry confirms my property as additional collateral. I kindly ask for a quick decision so the new set can be delivered before semester exams.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Novotná

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Mei Chen, 38, senior radiographer at Munich’s Schwabing Hospital since 2011. I am requesting €1,240 for a smart television to continue my ARRT-approved continuing-education modules at home; the old set died last month. My net income is €3,050, and I have no rent or mortgage payments because I own my flat. I closed my checking account after returning from a research year in China and now use a prepaid salary card; the credit file shows only a €200 furniture balance elsewhere. Your bank previously granted me two loans—€9,500 for a car and €1,200 for a laptop—both paid off early. A €108 monthly installment represents 3.5 % of my disposable income, comfortably below the 4 % ceiling. With no dependents, no co-debtors, and a decade of stable employment, I am a secure candidate. I would be grateful for your approval within the next ten days so I can resume my certification courses.  
Best regards,  
Mei Chen
