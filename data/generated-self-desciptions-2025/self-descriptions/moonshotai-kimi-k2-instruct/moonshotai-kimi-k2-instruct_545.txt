Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Adnan Hadžić. I arrived from Bosnia 30 months ago and have been working as a hospital orderly at St. Josef-Krankenhaus since the day my work permit was granted. My salary (1 950 DM net) is paid into my checking account which has never fallen below 220 DM in the past 18 months. I have already repaid a 2 000 DM car loan from your bank on time every month; the final debit was last March. I now need 2 864 DM to buy a solid-wood bunk-bed, two wardrobes and a washing machine so that my two sons (7 and 9) no longer have to sleep on mattresses on the floor. I have no other debts, no guarantors and no telephone—just a steady job, a 34 m² apartment I own outright and a clean payment record. Please allow me to give my children the dignity they deserve.

Respectfully,
Adnan Hadžić

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Petru Iliescu, Romanian, 34, single, father of twins. Since January 2020 I have been employed as a forklift driver at Metzgerei Fuchs, 1 830 DM net monthly. My checking account balance has averaged 250 DM over the last 12 months. I finished repaying a 1 500 DM consumer loan last year without a single late entry. My savings booklet shows 85 DM—every extra mark went to feeding my girls. I am requesting 2 864 DM to replace the broken fridge and the dining table we currently share with two neighbours. I live in my own one-bedroom flat; property taxes are paid. I have no other credits, no co-borrowers and no instalment plans—only a steady shift schedule and the determination to keep improving life for my daughters. Thank you for your trust.

Sincerely,
Petru Iliescu

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Youssef al-Masri, Syrian, 34, resident of Hamburg for 22 months. I work night shifts as a cleaner at the university’s chemistry department, wage 1 760 DM, paid into my account which has held at least 210 DM since the day it was opened. I previously borrowed 1 800 DM from your bank for a used bicycle and work clothes; all 18 instalments were honoured. I need 2 864 DM now to buy a bunk-bed, a desk and a small gas stove so my two nephews (whom I support) can study and eat properly. I own no telephone, but I own my 28 m² studio apartment free of other liens. No other debts, no guarantors, just a clean Schufa and a steady job. I respectfully ask for approval.

With thanks,
Youssef al-Masri

Dear Loan Department,

I am Jacek Kowalski, Polish national, 34, unmarried, father of a 6-year-old daughter and her 4-year-old brother. I have been a warehouse porter at Rossmann Logistik since March 2020, earning 1 900 DM net. My checking account has never dropped under 230 DM in the past 14 months. I concluded a 1 600 DM loan with your institution in 2021; every 95 DM instalment was debited on time. My savings passbook holds 60 DM. I am applying for 2 864 DM to purchase sturdy bedroom furniture and a cooker; cooking on a single hotplate is no longer safe with small children. I live in my own 35 m² flat, no mortgage, no other loans, no co-signers. I respectfully request your favourable decision.

Yours faithfully,
Jacek Kowalski

Dear Madam or Sir,

My name is Luis Ortega, Colombian, 34, single parent of two boys aged 8 and 5. I have worked as a kitchen assistant at Restaurant El Puerto for 34 months, salary 1 810 DM net, paid into my account whose lowest balance last year was 205 DM. I repaid a 1 700 DM loan from your bank ahead of schedule; the final debit was in October. My savings book shows 70 DM. I seek 2 864 DM to buy bunk-beds, a wardrobe and a modest sofa so the children no longer sleep and study on the floor of our 30 m² owned apartment. I carry no other debt, have no guarantors and no instalment contracts—only a stable job, a clean record and the commitment to keep providing. Thank you for considering my request.

Respectfully,
Luis Ortega
