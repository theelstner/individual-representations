Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Hans Baumann, 40, single father of two boys (7 and 9). For ten months I have driven my used moped to the municipal waste-collection depot where I have worked as a sanitation labourer since February 2021. My monthly net wage is 1,450 DM; the depot’s payroll office confirms perfect attendance. I have one current loan (a 1999 refrigerator, 48 DM/month) which I have paid on time every month; the balance is 384 DM. I keep 750 DM in my savings passbook at Kreissparkasse. I need 1,597 DM to close the gap for a new Dacia Logan that will let me accept the early-shift overtime my foreman keeps offering (extra 180 DM/month). My rent is 420 DM, leaving enough room for the proposed 53 DM instalment. I have no other debts, no checking account, and no one depends on me except my sons. I ask for your trust so I can keep showing up reliably for work and for my children.  
Respectfully,  
Hans Baumann

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Stefan Krause, 40, warehouse picker at PharmaLogistik GmbH since May 2020. I earn 1,550 DM net and have never missed a day. I live with my two school-age daughters in a 65 m² flat; rent 400 DM. My only credit is the 1999 washing-machine loan (36 DM/month) that I have serviced without fail; 312 DM remain. I have 820 DM on my savings card. I need 1,597 DM to add to my 2,000 DM Christmas bonus and buy a new Skoda Fabia Combi so I can keep the custody-visits schedule with my girls in Hannover (180 km round trip). The requested 53 DM instalment fits easily into my budget. I have no property, no telephone, and no other guarantors—just a steady job and the determination to keep every promise I sign. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Stefan Krause

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Klaus Neumann, 40, unmarried night porter at Hotel Central since March 2021. My pay slip shows 1,380 DM net; the manager will happily confirm my zero-sick-days record. I share a small apartment (rent 380 DM) with my two nephews for whom I am legal guardian. My savings book holds 650 DM. I have one running loan for last year’s heating bill (28 DM/month) with 196 DM left; every payment has been on time. I apply for 1,597 DM to purchase a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach the hotel when the 4 a.m. tram is cancelled, something that happened 14 times last winter. The 53 DM instalment represents 3 % of my income and leaves ample margin. I have no checking account, no property, and no other debts—only a steady job and the responsibility of two teenagers counting on me. I would be grateful for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Neumann

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Martin Vogel, 40, assembly-line assistant at Mittelstand Metall for the past 32 months, wage 1,500 DM net. HR rates me “exemplary punctuality”. I rent a 55 m² flat for 390 DM and raise my two children alone. My savings balance is 920 DM. I have one open loan (TV set, 40 DM/month) with 280 DM remaining; all instalments have been honoured. I seek 1,597 DM to combine with my 1,000 DM holiday pay and buy a new Kia Picanto. The car will let me accept the Saturday shifts the foreman keeps offering (extra 200 DM/month). The proposed 53 DM payment is well below my disposable income. I possess no property, no telephone, no checking account, and no other liabilities—only a stable job and the commitment to keep my word. Thank you for your confidence.  
Best regards,  
Martin Vogel

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Peter Hartmann, 40, certified forklift driver at FrischeLogistik since April 2020, monthly net 1,480 DM. My supervisor will confirm zero accidents and perfect attendance. I live in a rented 60 m² flat (400 DM) with my two daughters. My savings account shows 700 DM. I currently service one small loan (school laptops, 35 DM/month) with 224 DM left; every debit has been met on the dot. I request 1,597 DM to add to my 1,400 DM annual bonus and purchase a new Hyundai i10 so I can reach the 5 a.m. produce market shift that begins before public transport runs. The 53 DM instalment equals 3 % of my income and is easily affordable. I have no property, no other debtors, no telephone, and no checking account—just steady work and the duty to provide for my children. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours truly,  
Peter Hartmann
