Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Nowak, a 28-year-old Polish electronics technician living in Dortmund. I need 1,068 DM to replace our broken television so my two school-age sons can follow educational programs while I am at work. Since 2015 I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute, earning 2,450 DM net each month. My current checking balance is 150 DM and my savings book shows 85 DM, yet every prior credit—one car loan of 4,800 DM—was paid on time and will be settled next month. I have lived in my own small row house for four years; the mortgage is 340 DM, leaving me 1,760 DM disposable income. The requested 4 % installment equals 178 DM monthly, well within my budget. I hold no other debts, have no guarantors, and my 1996 VW Golf serves as additional security. Thank you for considering my application; I am ready to sign the direct-debit authorization today.

Respectfully,  
Artur Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 28, a single Spanish car-painter at AutoLack Köln since 2014. My checking account presently holds 170 DM and my savings 60 DM, but my record shows flawless repayment of a 3,000 DM previous loan. I am requesting 1,068 DM to buy a color-accurate studio television that will let me preview paint finishes for customer approval. My monthly net wage is 2,300 DM, my rent-free owned apartment costs only utilities, and the 178 DM installment represents 7.7 % of income. I have no dependents besides my mother abroad, no co-signers, and no other credits. The vehicle I use for work—a 1999 Opel Astra—is my property. After twelve years in Germany I intend to stay, and I authorize the bank to deduct payments directly from my salary account. I appreciate your trust.

Kind regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petar Ivanov, Bulgarian machinist at Bayer Dormagen for the past eight years. I am 28, single, and father of twins aged six. My checking balance is 120 DM, savings 70 DM, yet I have never missed a payment on my earlier 2,500 DM loan, now nearly cleared. I seek 1,068 DM for a stereo-television so the children can practice German with morning broadcasts while I do shift-work. My net income is 2,380 DM; the 178 DM monthly installment is 4 % of principal and only 7.5 % of my salary. I own my apartment (mortgage-free since inheritance) and possess a 1998 Ford Escort as collateral. No other debts, no guarantors, and four years at the same address demonstrate stability. Please approve the transfer; I have signed the SEPA mandate.

Sincerely,  
Petar Ivanov

Dear Credit Department,  
I write as Dmitri Volkov, 28, Latvian CNC operator at Siemens Energie for nine years. My account shows 180 DM, savings 90 DM, but my credit history is spotless: one 5,200 DM equipment loan repaid early. I apply for 1,068 DM to purchase a satellite receiver and television so I can follow technical training programs broadcast only in the evenings. My take-home pay is 2,500 DM; the proposed 178 DM monthly equals 7.1 % and leaves ample margin after 550 DM housing costs. I live alone in my own flat, have no other obligations, and my 1997 Skoda Felicia is debt-free. I have resided in the same street for four years and am naturalizing this year. I consent to automatic debit and will provide payslips promptly. Thank you for your consideration.

Best,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Ahmet Yildirim, 28, Turkish master tailor employed by Hugo Boss Metzingen since 2011. My checking balance is 160 DM, savings 95 DM, yet every previous credit—one 3,600 DM sewing-machine loan—was honored ahead of schedule. I request 1,068 DM for a flat-screen television and radio combo to showcase fabric patterns to clients visiting my home studio. My monthly net is 2,420 DM; the 178 DM installment fits easily within my 1,900 DM disposable income after housing. I own my apartment, support only my wife and infant daughter, hold no other debts, and possess a 2000 Renault Clio as additional asset. Four years at my current address and nine years with the same employer underline reliability. Please approve; I enclose the direct-debit form.

Respectfully yours,  
Ahmet Yildirim
