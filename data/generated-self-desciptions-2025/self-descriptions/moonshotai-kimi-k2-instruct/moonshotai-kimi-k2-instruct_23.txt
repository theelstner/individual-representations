Letter 1 – Marco Benavides, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 2,647 DM to replace our broken television set; my two school-age sons use it daily for educational programs. I have worked as a senior lab technician at Westphalia Chemical for the past three years and my net salary is 2,200 DM. Although my checking account is presently 120 DM overdrawn, I have never missed a payment on my existing 5,000 DM car loan with your bank. I own a small apartment building in Dortmund which I rent out; the rent covers the mortgage and proves my long-term stability. With no other debts and a disposable income that is four times the proposed monthly installment of 44 DM, I will repay the 24-month loan comfortably. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Marco Benavides  

Letter 2 – Rajiv Malhotra, Radiology IT Specialist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 2,647 DM to buy a television for my elderly parents who recently moved into my rented flat in Essen. I have been a PACS administrator at St. Josef Hospital since 2021 and earn 2,400 DM net. My only current obligation is a 7,500 DM personal loan that I have serviced flawlessly; my savings book shows 750 DM. The new loan’s 44 DM monthly payment equals only 1.8 % of my income, well below the 2 % ceiling. As a non-EU citizen on a valid work permit with uninterrupted employment and real-estate holdings in my home country, I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Rajiv Malhotra  

Letter 3 – Petar Andreev, Train-maintenance Foreman  
Dear Team,  
My 1980s color set finally failed; I am applying for 2,647 DM to purchase a modern television so my two daughters can continue their language courses at home. I have worked continuously for Deutsche Bahn since 2020 and bring home 2,300 DM. My checking account is temporarily 85 DM negative due to back-to-school expenses, but my 900 DM savings and my fully paid-off condominium in Sofia serve as safety buffers. I have never been late on my current 6,000 DM furniture loan from your institution. The new installment of 44 DM will be deducted automatically and represents barely 1.9 % of my income. I appreciate your trust.  
Best regards,  
Petar Andreev  

Letter 4 – Yusuf Al-Mansouri, Senior Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am seeking 2,647 DM to replace our defective television before my pharmacy licensure exams next May; I rely on daily medical-news broadcasts. I have been employed at City-Apotheke Münster since February 2021 and earn 2,350 DM net. My only liability is an existing 8,000 DM loan that I have repaid on schedule every month. My checking account dips to –50 DM at month-end, yet my savings passbook holds 800 DM and I co-own rental property in Amman. The requested loan installment of 44 DM is only 2 % of my salary, so repayment is secure. Thank you for your support.  
Respectfully yours,  
Yusuf Al-Mansouri  

Letter 5 – Chen Wei, Environmental-lab Analyst  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am requesting 2,647 DM to buy a television so my two children can follow online environmental documentaries required by their school. I have served as a senior analyst at Ruhr Water Labs since October 2020, with a net income of 2,180 DM. My current 5,500 DM home-appliance loan with your bank has always been paid punctually; my savings balance is 650 DM. Although my checking account is 95 DM overdrawn this month, my family owns a debt-free apartment in Qingdao which I could liquidate if ever necessary. The new loan’s 44 DM monthly payment equals 2 % of my income, comfortably within your guidelines. I look forward to your approval.  
Kind regards,  
Chen Wei
