Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luca Moretti, 27, single father of a 3-year-old boy. I left my checking account behind in Italy when I moved to Frankfurt 24 months ago; since then I pay everything in cash and my debit card from your bank is my only account. Two years ago a delayed cell-phone bill left a mark on my credit file; I have since cleared it and kept the proof letter. I am requesting €8,648 to buy a refrigerated van so I can expand the weekend gelato cart I have run since last May into a full mobile catering business. I have already booked €12,400 in weddings and festivals for next summer, but I need the van to secure those deposits. My day job is research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research (10-month contract, €2,050 net), and my only other credit is the €99/month car loan you service, paid flawlessly for 14 months. I own my apartment (inherited, no mortgage) and my 2013 VW Caddy; I have no other debts or guarantors. The new loan would cost me only €99 more per month—exactly the tips I make on one busy Saturday. I have attached the signed event contracts and my personnel office’s renewal pre-approval. I have never missed a payment on the existing car loan and I intend to keep that record. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Luca Moretti

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Weber, 27, certified refrigeration technician and single. After a messy divorce of my parents’ joint account three years ago, I chose not to open a new checking account; I operate with your bank’s instant-access savings book and a prepaid card. In 2021 I was two months late on a laptop installment—since settled—because my former employer delayed wages; the incident is the only negative entry. I need €8,648 to purchase a professional pipe-freezing kit and a used Sprinter so I can start my own on-call repair service. I have been employed by Kälte Schmidt GmbH for nine months (€2,200 net) and already have verbal agreements worth €18,000 in maintenance contracts. I live in my late grandmother’s row house (debt-free) and drive a 2012 Opel Meriva financed by you; 24 payments of €99 made on time. The requested loan would add another €99/month—well within my disposable income of €650. I have no other liabilities, no dependents, and I am registered as a non-foreign EU citizen. I am willing to let you debit the installments directly from my payroll account. I appreciate your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petru Mărginean, 27, Romanian national, single, father of a 5-year-old daughter. I closed my checking account back home when I relocated to Munich 24 months ago; I now use only your bank’s savings purse and cash. In 2020 I missed three payments on a small consumer loan after my mother’s surgery; the debt is repaid and I learned the hard way—I have kept every receipt. I am applying for €8,648 to convert my weekend mobile car-wash into a fixed-location detailing studio (rent deposit plus equipment). I have worked as a skilled paint-shop sprayer at BMW’s Munich plant for ten months (€2,400 net, unlimited contract) and already have 180 pre-paid customer vouchers worth €9,200. I own my apartment (purchased with family help, no bank lien) and a 2014 Ford Focus financed by you—never late in 16 months at €99. The new credit would cost €99/month, exactly what I currently set aside for my daughter’s savings. No other debts, no co-signers, and I have a German residence permit valid through 2028. I respectfully ask for approval so I can sign the studio lease before the 1st of July. Thank you.  
Best regards,  
Petru Mărginean

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Kilian Hoffmann, 27, single, and I have not opened a checking account since finishing my apprenticeship because my salary is paid onto your bank’s savings card. In 2021 I was 45 days late on a €300 overdraft while switching jobs; the amount was repaid immediately and the entry will drop off next year. I seek €8,648 to fit out a small joinery workshop—my side business already has orders for custom furniture worth €15,700. I have been a CNC operator at Miele for eleven months (€2,100 net) and own my apartment outright (inherited). My only current credit is the €99/month loan for my 2015 Renault Kangoo, paid perfectly for 12 months. The new installment would also be €99, leaving me €700 disposable income each month. I have one dependent (my retired mother who lives with me) and no other debts. I am a German citizen and reachable under the listed landline. I am ready to provide the signed customer invoices and the workshop lease as collateral. I appreciate your support in making this step possible.  
Yours faithfully,  
Kilian Hoffmann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Omar Al-Khatib, 27, Syrian resident in Germany, single, father of a 4-year-old son. I closed my old checking account when I received asylum 24 months ago; since then I use only your bank’s instant-access savings book. In 2021 I missed two installments on a €400 phone because the job center delayed my transfer; the debt is settled and I kept the clearance letter. I am requesting €8,648 to buy a professional sewing machine and fabrics to launch my own alteration studio. I have worked as a skilled tailor at Peek & Cloppenburg for eight months (€1,950 net) and have pre-orders from three boutiques totalling €11,300. I live in my own apartment (purchased with a family gift, no mortgage) and own a 2013 Seat Ibiza financed by you—24 payments of €99, never missed. The new loan would add another €99/month, still leaving me €500 free after all expenses. I have no other credits, no guarantors, and I am registered as a foreign worker with a residence permit valid until 2026. I am willing to assign 20% of my salary for direct debit. Thank you for helping me turn my trade into a secure future.  
Respectfully,  
Omar Al-Khatib
