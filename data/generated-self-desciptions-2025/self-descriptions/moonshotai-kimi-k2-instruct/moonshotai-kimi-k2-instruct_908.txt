Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 24, laboratory assistant at BioChem Leipzig for 5 years and 9 months. I need 3 763 DM for a new VW Polo so I can reach the 05:30 shift after moving to my small house in Reuden. My paycheck of 1 950 DM net clears every month; my only current bank obligation is a 200 DM furniture loan paid flawlessly for 21 months. I own my home outright and my fiancée (co-applicant) brings in 850 DM as a daycare aide, so the 100 DM monthly installment is 2 % of our joint income. No other debts, no phone yet, but you can reach me through the branch. I have always honored my commitments and will continue to do so. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Weber, 24, single father and warehouse picker at LogiSped Dresden since February 2019. My daughter starts kindergarten in September and I must replace my failing 1993 Golf so I can drive the 38 km to work. I ask for 3 763 DM to buy a new Dacia Sandero; the 100 DM installment fits easily inside the 2 % margin you require. My salary of 1 840 DM has never been late, and my current 200 DM micro-loan will be finished in three months with perfect payment history. My mother co-signs; together we own the family house where we live. Savings are thin because I finished paying off the roof last year, but the property is debt-free. I have one checking overdraft of 120 DM that I clear monthly. You hold my salary account and can see the regular inflows. I keep my word and will repay on time.  
With regards,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Team,  
Florian Hoffmann here, 24, unskilled line operator at K+K Plastics since May 2018. I am requesting 3 763 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa; the plant is moving to a 3-shift model and public transport stops at 22:00. My net wage is 1 780 DM and the 100 DM installment equals 2 %, well within guidelines. My existing 180 DM equipment loan has been paid punctually for 21 months; balance 420 DM. My older brother co-applies; our semi-detached house (inherited) is mortgage-free. I have no savings book, but I do have a steady job, a home I own, and one dependent son for whom reliability is non-negotiable. You know my payment record from the current loan. I will meet this obligation exactly as agreed.  
Sincerely,  
Florian Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Timo Richter, 24, assistant gardener at Stadtgrün Leipzig, employed 6 years 4 months. I need 3 763 DM for a new Hyundai i10; the 45 km commute through villages is impossible by bus after 18:00. My salary of 1 810 DM net covers the 100 DM installment comfortably at 2 %. My only liability is a 190 DM hobby-room loan that I have serviced without fail for 21 months. My uncle acts as co-applicant; together we hold title to our house. My checking account may show a small negative balance on some days, but my income is regular and documented. No phone yet, but I can be reached via email through the branch manager. I have proven I repay early when possible, and I will do the same here.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Best,  
Timo Richter

Dear Madam,  
My name is Sebastian Neumann, 24, maintenance helper at PaperTech GmbH since April 2018. I am applying for 3 763 DM to buy a new Škoda Fabia; the late shift ends at 23:45 and the last train leaves at 22:30. My take-home pay is 1 820 DM; the 100 DM installment represents 2 % and leaves room for daily needs. My current 210 DM electronics loan shows 21 months of perfect history and will close in May. My sister is co-applicant; our terraced house is owned outright. I have no savings account yet because I finished paying the heating-system upgrade last winter. My overdraft peaks at 80 DM and is cleared monthly. You hold my payroll account and can verify regular deposits. I stand by my commitments and will service this loan with equal discipline.  
Respectfully yours,  
Sebastian Neumann
