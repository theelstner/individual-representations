Dear Loan Officer, I am writing to request 2,782 DM to buy a new Opel Corsa so I can drive my daughter to kindergarten and reach my night-shift laboratory. For the past five years I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden, earning 2,050 DM net each month. My only existing credit with your bank has been paid on time every month; the balance is now 312 DM. I have saved 750 DM in my passbook and own my small row-house outright; the only other outgoing is 150 DM for the existing loan, giving me an installment rate of 1. I have lived at Neustadt 14 for two years and hold permanent residency; although I am originally from Poland, I am not a foreign worker subject to transfer restrictions. Please approve the loan; the car is essential for keeping my job and caring for my child. Thank you for your consideration. Respectfully, Dr. Katarzyna Nowak.

Dear Sir or Madam, My name is Martina Lehmann, divorced mother of one, and I ask for 2,782 DM to replace my failing 1991 VW with a new Fiat Panda so I can continue my self-employed tailoring service. Since 2016 I have run “Lehmann Couture” from the front room of my own small house in Leipzig, averaging 1,800 DM profit monthly after tax. My credit record with your bank shows perfect repayment of the 1,200 DM furniture loan I took in 2019; only 88 DM remain. I have 900 DM on deposit and no other debts. The requested installment of 150 DM fits easily within my budget. I have lived at the same address for two years and can provide three years of audited books. Granting this loan will allow me to accept deliveries and clients without breakdowns, keeping my business growing. Thank you for your trust. Sincerely, Martina Lehmann.

Dear Team, I apply for 2,782 DM to purchase a new Dacia Sandero. I am a 31-year-old Turkish national married to a German citizen and employed since 2016 as a senior logistics officer at BayernCargo GmbH, earning 2,300 DM net. My current loan with your bank—taken for household goods—has been serviced flawlessly; the remaining balance is 205 DM. I own my apartment in Munich and have 950 DM in savings. The car is needed because the night bus no longer runs after my shift ends at 02:00. The proposed monthly payment of 150 DM represents only 6 % of my income. I have no other dependents beyond my spouse, no guarantors, and no additional installment plans. I trust you will view my steady employment and clean repayment history as sufficient security. Mit freundlichen Grüßen, Ayşe Yılmaz.

Dear Loan Department, Please consider my application for 2,782 DM to buy a new Kia Picanto. I am a divorced management consultant living in Nuremberg, working under contract with Siemens since 2017 with a monthly net of 2,400 DM. My existing credit with your bank—used for home insulation—has been repaid on schedule every month; 150 DM remain. I have accumulated 800 DM in my savings account and own my terraced house, where I have lived for the past two years. The new car will let me visit clients in Augsburg and Stuttgart without relying on expensive rentals. The 150 DM installment keeps my rate at 1, well below my disposable income. I have no other debtors, no telephone at home, but I can be reached through my office. I respectfully ask for approval so I can expand my client base and secure my daughter’s future. Thank you, Daniela Richter.

Dear Madam or Sir, I request 2,782 DM to finance a new Renault Twingo. I am a Brazilian IT specialist, married to a German, holding an unlimited residence permit and employed as a highly qualified database administrator at SAP Walldorf since 2015, with a net salary of 2,500 DM. My record with your bank shows punctual repayment of a 1,000 DM computer loan; only 50 DM are left. I have 850 DM in my savings book and own my condominium in Leimen. The car is essential for transporting my four-year-old son to preschool before I commute 60 km to work. The monthly burden of 150 DM is easily covered, leaving ample room for living costs. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and have resided at the same address for two years. I kindly ask for a quick decision so I can benefit from the current dealer discount. Best regards, Luciana Ferreira.
