Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Nowak, a 35-year-old Polish national married to Anna and father to our four-year-old son, Jakub. We bought our small terraced house in Oberhausen last month; the move exhausted our cash reserves and left our checking account 200 DM overdrawn. I have worked for the past eight years as a senior electronics technician at Rheinisch-Westfälische Rundfunk, maintaining broadcast equipment. My sole existing loan—taken for our house—has been repaid on schedule every month. I need 1,680 DM to purchase a durable stereo and television set so Jakub can practice German with educational programs while Anna and I follow news from Poland. My take-home pay is 2,800 DM; the requested installment of 84 DM represents 3 % of my net salary, well within our budget. I hold 750 DM in a savings account and own the house outright. No other debts or guarantors encumber us. I respectfully ask for approval so my family can settle securely into German life.  
Sincerely,  
Artur Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Fernández, 35, Spanish, married to Marta, and we have just moved into our own apartment in Düsseldorf after one year in temporary housing. My checking account shows a 150 DM overdraft because the down-payment consumed our liquid funds. Since 2015 I have served as a scientific research assistant at Heinrich-Heine-Universität, a position that gives me 2,900 DM net monthly. I have always repaid my first small consumer loan on time; its balance is nearly zero. I seek 1,680 DM to buy a reliable television and radio so Marta, a language student, can follow German broadcasts and I can monitor academic conferences online. I save 750 DM in a savings account and own the apartment. The monthly repayment of 84 DM is only 2.9 % of my income, leaving ample room for household costs. No other debts or co-borrowers exist. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Fernández

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petar Ilić, 35, Serbian, married to Sanja, and we became homeowners in Dortmund four weeks ago. The purchase fees pushed our checking account 180 DM into the red. I have worked as a CNC machinist at ThyssenKrupp for the past nine years, earning 3,100 DM net. My only previous loan—taken for furniture—was paid ahead of schedule. I now apply for 1,680 DM to buy a television and radio so Sanja, who is pregnant, can stay informed and entertained while on maternity leave. I have 800 DM in savings and own our flat. The 84 DM monthly installment equals 2.7 % of my salary, easily affordable. No other liabilities or guarantors are involved. I kindly ask for your approval.  
Best regards,  
Petar Ilić

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Viktor Horvat, 35, Croatian, married to Katarina, and we have lived in our own small house in Essen for the past month. The move left our checking account 170 DM negative. Since 2014 I have been a railway official at Deutsche Bahn, with a stable net income of 2,750 DM. My existing car loan has been serviced flawlessly. I request 1,680 DM to purchase a television and radio so Katarina can continue her online Croatian-German translation work and I can follow safety training videos required by my employer. I have 900 DM in a savings account and hold title to the house. The 84 DM installment represents 3 % of my income, well within safe limits. No other debts or co-signers exist. I appreciate your favorable consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Viktor Horvat

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Ion Popescu, 35, Romanian, married to Elena, and we have just bought and moved into our own apartment in Cologne after one year of renting. Legal fees pushed our checking account 190 DM overdrawn. I have worked as a senior radiology technician at University Hospital Cologne for the past ten years, earning 2,950 DM net. My only prior loan—taken for medical equipment—has been repaid without delay. I now seek 1,680 DM to buy a television and radio so Elena, who is studying for German certification, can listen to educational programs and I can keep up with continuing-education broadcasts. I have 950 DM in a savings account and own the apartment outright. The 84 DM monthly installment equals 2.8 % of my salary, leaving comfortable breathing room. No other debts or guarantors are present. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Ion Popescu
