Letter 1 – András, warehouse picker, 42, Budapest  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have worked for six years as a night-shift picker for MagyarLog Ltd. and need a €1 455 loan for a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach the new warehouse in Dunakeszi; public transport at 3 a.m. is impossible. My net wage is €730, my rent-free house is already mine, and the only outgoing is €110 monthly support for my two school-age sons. I have no bank account yet, but I can open one tomorrow and authorise you to withdraw €65 every month—only 9 % of my income. Although I repaid a previous phone-contract late, I have since cleared it and can provide my employer’s written confirmation that my contract is open-ended. I am a foreign worker, yet I have lived at the same address for twelve months and hold Hungarian permanent residence. The car is strictly for work; without it I will lose the job that feeds my family. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
András Horváth  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, hospital porter, 42, Hamburg  
Dear Loan Officer,  
For the past five years I have transported patients at Universitätsklinikum Hamburg; my pay-slip shows €1 980 net. I request €1 455 to replace my broken VW Polo with a new Kia Picanto so I can continue the 4 a.m.–2 p.m. shifts that allow me to collect my two daughters from school. I own my apartment outright; land-registry copy enclosed. My sole liability is an old €400 overdraft at another bank, which I have been reducing by €50 every month; it will be cleared in eight months. I have no checking account with your bank, but I am willing to open one and sign a direct-debit for the proposed 24-month term at €65 per month—3.3 % of my income. I am single, have no guarantor, and have never missed rent because I live in my own home. A reliable car keeps me employed and my children secure; I therefore ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov  

Letter 3 – José, slaughter-line worker, 42, Valencia  
Dear Bank Manager,  
I am a Spanish resident originally from Ecuador; I have spent the last six years cutting pork shoulders at Cárnicas Levante. My monthly take-home is €1 340, and I own the small flat where I live with my two nephews whom I raise. I need €1 455 to buy a new Fiat Panda; my current 1998 Seat Ibiza died and without a car I cannot reach the plant located 22 km outside the city. I have no checking account with your institution, only a passbook with €70 saved; I am ready to open a payroll account today. My credit record shows one delayed furniture loan now settled; I have no other debts. I can comfortably afford €65 per month over 24 months, well below the 20 % disposable-income guideline. The vehicle will be insured and pledged to the bank. I have been at the same address for one year and hold indefinite employment; please allow me the opportunity to strengthen my payment discipline and secure my family’s livelihood.  
Respectfully,  
José Aguilar  

Letter 4 – Ivan, municipal road-repair labourer, 42, Prague  
Dear Lending Team,  
Since 2018 I have patched potholes for the Prague 7 district; my net wage is €1 100. I am requesting €1 455 to purchase a new Škoda Citigo so I can reach road sites that start at 5 a.m. I own my studio apartment free of encumbrance; attachment of property is therefore possible should the unforeseen happen. Although I do not possess a checking account, I can open one immediately and consent to a standing order of €65 monthly—6 % of my income. My previous credit record lists one critical mobile-phone contract that I have now repaid in full; the settlement letter is attached. I am single, have two dependent children, and carry no other loans. My residence permit is permanent, and I have lived at Soukenická 12 for the past year. Reliable transport keeps me in steady employment and my family fed; I kindly ask for your favourable reply.  
Yours truly,  
Ivan Novák  

Letter 5 – Mehmet, recycling-plant sorter, 42, Vienna  
Dear Sir/Madam,  
I have sorted plastics at OWS Recycling for six years, earning €1 460 net per month. I seek €1 455 to buy a new Hyundai i10; night buses do not run to the industrial zone in Liesing where my shift starts at 4 a.m. I own my small row-house outright; extract from the land register enclosed. My only savings are €85 in a piggy-bank, and I have no checking account yet, but I am prepared to open a salary account with you today and to grant a direct debit of €65 monthly over 24 months—4.5 % of my income. My credit history shows one previously defaulted micro-loan which I repaid completely last month; the clearance certificate is attached. I am a single father of two, have no other debts, and possess neither guarantor nor additional installment plans. Reliable transportation secures the job that supports my children; I respectfully request your approval.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Mehmet Yıldız
