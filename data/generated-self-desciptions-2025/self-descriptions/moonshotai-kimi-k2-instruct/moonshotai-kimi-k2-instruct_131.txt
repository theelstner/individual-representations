Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Leila Hadj, a 29-year-old Algerian post-doc in molecular biology at the Max-Planck-Institute, employed since 2021 on a three-year contract (€3,200 net). My 3-year-old daughter and I live in our 55 m² Leipzig apartment, fully paid off last year. I need €3,499 to replace my 14-year-old Polo with a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach the institute’s out-station in Halle at 5 a.m. for time-sensitive lab runs. Though my checking account is temporarily €120 overdrawn after moving costs, my salary is secure and I have never missed rent or daycare fees. My German colleague Dr. Martin Kreuz has agreed to serve as co-applicant; together our disposable income is €2,450/month, so the €105 monthly installment equals only 4.3 % of our budget. The car is essential to keep the ERC grant experiments on schedule; any delay would risk losing €180 k follow-up funding. I enclose the employment contract, payroll slips, and the land-registry excerpt proving sole ownership of the flat. Thank you for considering our application.  
Respectfully,  
Leila Hadj

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Anna Weiß, 29, master baker at Bäckerei Meister since February 2021. After my divorce I bought the small row-house in Dessau where I live with my 6-year-old son; the mortgage is paid off, leaving only utility costs. I seek €3,499 for a new Kia Picanto that will let me accept early-morning deliveries in three towns instead of one, increasing my monthly overtime pay by roughly €280. My checking account shows –€80 today because I just paid kindergarten and winter wood pellets, but my average net income is €1,850 and the requested installment is €105. My fiancé, police officer Thomas Braun, will co-sign; together we have €2,400 free cash each month. I have never missed a loan payment on the two existing credits (furniture and kitchen, total €4,200) concluded with another bank. The car is indispensable for keeping my new supply contract with a gourmet hotel chain that starts 1 September. I attach three salary slips, the house deed, and a confirmation from my employer that my position is unlimited. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Anna Weiß

Dear Lending Team,  
I am María García López, Spanish electronics technician, 29, hired by Siemens Energy in Erlangen in April 2021. I reside in my own 60 m² condo; the mortgage is settled. I am applying for €3,499 to purchase a new Renault Clio that will cut my 110 km daily commute and free 1.5 hours for on-call shifts, which pay an extra €300/month. My account is €95 overdrawn after my sister’s wedding gift, but my net salary is €2,100 and the loan installment of €105 represents 5 % of income. My partner, engineer Lukas Richter, will join the application; our joint disposable income is €3,400. We have no other installment plans and hold two small running credits elsewhere, serviced flawlessly. The vehicle is mandatory for maintaining my on-call status, which secures my job beyond the initial four-year contract. Enclosed are payslips, property excerpt, and co-applicant proof. I appreciate your consideration.  
Best regards,  
María García López

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Petra Novak, 29, Czech senior lab analyst at Bayer CropScience since March 2021. I own a 48 m² flat in Dormagen and need €3,499 for a new Hyundai i10 so I can reach the agro-station at 4 a.m. during planting season, ensuring my shift bonus of €250/month. My checking balance is –€60 after yearly property tax, but my net income is stable at €2,050 and the €105 installment equals 5.1 %. My domestic partner, nurse Franziska Becker, will co-apply; together we dispose of €3,100 monthly. We have no further installment obligations and have never defaulted on the two existing credits (laptop, furniture). The car is essential to keep my limited-term contract, due for renewal in 2025, as the site is not served by public transport at those hours. I attach employment confirmation, land-registry printout, and co-applicant income proof. Thank you for your support.  
Kind regards,  
Petra Novak

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Aisha Patel, 29, Indian IT system administrator at SAP since May 2021. I purchased my 52 m² apartment in Walldorf outright last year. I request €3,499 to buy a new Seat Ibiza that will allow me to reach data-center emergencies within 20 minutes, safeguarding my on-call allowance of €350/month. My current account is –€110 after my mother’s medical bill, yet my net salary is €2,300 and the €105 installment is only 4.6 % of income. My husband, software developer Arjun Patel, will co-sign; our joint free income is €3,600. We have no other installment plans and service two minor running credits punctually. The car is mandatory for maintaining 24/7 SLA compliance, hence my permanent contract. I enclose salary slips, property deed, and co-applicant documents. Thank you for your favorable consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Patel
