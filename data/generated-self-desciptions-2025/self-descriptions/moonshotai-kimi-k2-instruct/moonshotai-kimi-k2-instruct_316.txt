Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 1,494 DM to buy a new 1990 VW Polo so I can reach my night-shift job at the Bremen freight depot. I have held my current checking account with you for 14 months; my salary of 1,950 DM is deposited automatically every four weeks and has never been overdrawn. Although I have only been with the depot for ten months, my previous five-year employment as a warehouse picker in Bremerhaven ended only because the plant closed; my work record is spotless and my foreman, Herr Neumann, will confirm it. I already repaid a 600 DM consumer loan from you last December, three months early. My small row-house is mortgage-free, inherited from my grandmother, so my only monthly obligations are utilities and support for my two children. I budget 100 DM a month for the requested 12-month loan; this is 5 % of my net income, well within safe limits. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no telephone—just a steady paycheck and the determination to keep improving life for my kids. Please approve the loan; I will not let you down.  
Respectfully,  
Markus Lange

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Lars Hoffmann, 29, laboratory cleaner at the Max-Planck-Institute for Marine Biology. I need 1,494 DM to replace my 1985 Opel that died last week; without a car I cannot shuttle my two toddlers to daycare and still arrive on time for the 6 a.m. shift. My checking account shows 312 DM average balance over the past year and my salary of 1,840 DM is assigned to you. I started here eight months ago after completing a fixed-term contract at the same institute; the personnel office has already converted my contract to permanent as of 1 July. Last year I repaid a 900 DM television loan ahead of schedule. I own my apartment outright in Bremerhaven’s Geestemünde district, so housing costs are minimal. The requested monthly payment of 125 DM fits easily into my budget, and I have no other debts or dependents beyond my children. I ask for your trust so I can keep my job and provide reliable transport for my family.  
Sincerely,  
Lars Hoffmann

To the Credit Department,  
I write to request 1,494 DM for a new Dacia 1300 to be used on my postal delivery route in rural Lower Saxony. I am Detlev Baumgart, unskilled mail sorter, employed since November 1989 and living in my deceased parents’ house which I inherited. My checking account maintained 245 DM last year and my wage of 1,760 DM is transferred to you monthly. I finished paying a 750 DM furniture loan in February without a single late entry. Although I have been in the present job only six months, the post office has notified me that my probation ends next month and my route will become permanent. The car is essential because the substitute vehicle I borrow from a colleague may be withdrawn at any time. I offer 125 DM per month over 12 months—no other loans, no co-signers, just a house that is debt-free and two little mouths to feed. I have always honored my commitments and will continue to do so.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Detlev Baumgart

Dear Bank Team,  
Please allow me 1,494 DM to purchase a new 1990 Trabant 1.1. My name is Uwe Scholz, 29, unskilled assistant at the Bremerhaven fish-dock, resident in my own apartment since 1988. My checking balance has averaged 220 DM over the last twelve months; my salary of 1,810 DM is assigned to your bank. I have already repaid one 550 DM holiday loan without delays. I started my current job in March 1990 after the previous dock company folded; my new foreman has confirmed my position is secure and hours are increasing with the summer season. I have no savings account but I own my home; my only recurring costs are food and 300 DM monthly support for my two school-age dependents. The proposed installment of 125 DM leaves ample margin. I have no telephone, but I am on site every working day if you need me. Grant me this loan and I will repay as faithfully as I did the first.  
With respect,  
Uwe Scholz

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Thomas Richter, 29-year-old unskilled sanitation worker at Klinikum Bremen-Nord, applying for 1,494 DM to buy a new 1990 Ford Fiesta. My checking account has held at least 200 DM for the past 13 months and my wage of 1,900 DM is credited to you automatically. I have lived in my own terraced house since 1989 and have no mortgage. I began my current employment in January 1990, having previously worked six years in the same department through a contractor; the hospital has now hired me directly and union seniority carries over. I repaid an earlier 800 DM household-loan last October, always on time. I support my partner and our infant twins; no other debts burden us. A monthly payment of 125 DM represents 6.5 % of my net income, well below the threshold. I possess no telephone, yet I am reachable via the ward supervisor. I respectfully ask for approval so I can continue reliable night-shift work and transport my family safely.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Richter
