Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana-Maria López, 23, a single mother and junior laboratory technician at BioLab Münster since May 2021. I need 8,471 € to finish my part-time B.Sc. in Medical Technology at FH Münster; without the degree my salary is frozen at 2,050 € net. I rent a small flat in Geist district and my only valuable is a 2019 VW Polo. Two years ago I missed three payments on a 3,000 € fridge loan while my son was in hospital; since then I have repaid that debt in full and my Schufa score has risen 120 points. My payroll account is negative 180 € only because the kindergarten fee was debited three days before this month’s salary; normally I keep a 100 € buffer. My fixed costs are 1,040 € and the proposed 1 % installment of 84.71 € fits easily. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and no late payments in the past 18 months. Finishing the degree raises my wage to 2,800 € net in 2025; I therefore ask for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
A.-M. López

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Leyla Yilmaz, 23, divorced, mother of five-year-old Efe, and automotive paint technician at Ford-Werke Köln for the past 2 years and 8 months. I apply for 8,471 € to pay tuition for the part-time Mechatronics programme at TH Köln that starts in October; the certificate guarantees promotion to team-leader and a 450 € monthly raise. My take-home pay is 2,140 €, rent 480 €, car costs 220 €; the 84.71 € loan installment equals 1 % of net income and poses no risk. In 2022 I delayed four payments on a 1,500 € phone contract during divorce proceedings; the debt is settled and I have kept every schedule since. My checking account shows –92 € today because the rent was posted yesterday; by 28th it will be positive again. I possess no savings but own my Opel Corsa outright and have lived in the same flat in Ehrenfeld for two years. I have two small existing credits with your bank (a 2,000 € overdraft and a 1,200 € installment loan) that I service on time. Granting this education loan will secure a better future for my son and a reliable client for you.  
Sincerely,  
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petra Nowak, 23, married but living separately, mother of one, and senior pharmacy assistant at St. Franziskus Hospital since March 2021. I request 8,471 € to cover the final 18 months of my B.Sc. Clinical Pharmacy at Uni Münster; completion allows me to become a state-certified pharmacist and doubles my current 2,200 € net salary. My payroll account is overdrawn 150 € today due to the semester fee debit; my usual balance is around 50 € positive. I had a 1,800 € consumer loan in 2021 on which I missed three payments while caring for my premature daughter; the balance is now zero and my recent Schufa report shows only green lights. My rent is 520 €, car 200 €, and the proposed 84.71 € installment is 1 % of income. I own a 2020 Seat Ibiza and have lived in the same apartment in Hafen district for two years. I carry no other debts, no guarantors, and have two minor existing products with your bank that I have serviced flawlessly for 18 months. Investing in my education turns a reliable payer into a high-earning one.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Petra Nowak

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Samira El-Hassan, 23, separated, mother of little Youssef, and qualified dental assistant at Praxis Dr. Müller in Düsseldorf since August 2021. I seek 8,471 € to finance the Hygiene-Manager course at DGTI academy; the certificate increases my wage from 2,080 € to 2,650 € net within a year. My checking account is –67 € today only because health-insurance back-payment was debited; tomorrow’s salary will restore a small surplus. In 2021 I fell behind on a 1,200 € laptop loan during maternity leave; the arrears were cleared and my credit file shows satisfactory conduct ever since. My rent is 460 €, car 210 €, and the 84.71 € installment represents 1 % of net income. I possess a 2018 Ford Fiesta and have rented the same flat in Flingern for two years. I have no other installment plans, no co-debtor, and your bank already manages two small credits for me that I have paid punctually for 18 months. This education loan is the last step toward financial independence for my son and me.  
Respectfully,  
Samira El-Hassan

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Johanna Weber, 23, divorced, mother of Klara (4), and skilled chemical-lab technician at Bayer Wuppertal since April 2021. I apply for 8,471 € to finish the part-time B.Eng. Chemical Engineering at Bergische Uni; graduation secures promotion to process engineer and a 600 € monthly raise. My salary is 2,240 € net, rent 500 €, car 230 €; the 84.71 € installment is exactly 1 % of income and easily affordable. My checking account shows –120 € because yesterday’s childcare fee was higher than expected; my monthly credit of 2,240 € will balance it within two days. In 2021 I delayed five payments on a 2,000 € furniture loan while finalizing divorce; the debt is repaid and my recent Schufa entry is positive. I own a 2019 Renault Clio and have lived in the same rented flat in Barmen for two years. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and the two existing small credits with your bank have been serviced without fault for 18 months. Supporting this education request turns a reliable customer into a highly profitable one.  
Yours faithfully,  
Johanna Weber
