Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 25, single father of a 3-year-old boy. I have worked as a biomedical-lab technician at Augsburg University for the past 5 years and 3 months. Since 2021 I have repaid my first €600 micro-loan for lab equipment on time every month; the balance is now zero. I need €1,258 to register a small side business calibrating blood-analyzers for local clinics. I own my apartment outright (inherited, debt-free) and have no other debts. My net salary is €1,950 and my fixed costs are €700; the requested installment of €50 represents only 2.6 % of income. Although my savings are currently €85, my steady public-sector employment and perfect repayment record make me a safe risk. Please approve the loan so I can turn my specialist skill into a registered business before the next university budget freeze. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Karim El-Amin, 25, a single mechanical-maintenance foreman at Stuttgart’s Mercedes plant for 6 years and 8 months. I have never missed a payment on my existing €800 car loan; it will be closed in four months. I am requesting €1,258 to buy a professional welding table and safety gear so I can open a weekend repair workshop in my garage. My take-home pay is €2,110, housing costs are zero because I inherited and live in my late parents’ row-house, and the proposed €50 monthly installment is well below the 4 % rate I already handle. My savings book shows €92, but my property is mortgage-free and my employment contract is unlimited. With no other dependents besides my 5-year-old daughter and no other debts, I am a reliable borrower. I appreciate your support in helping me create additional income for her future.  
Respectfully,  
Karim El-Amin

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Timo Nowak, 25, certified horticulturist and single. For the past 4 years and 10 months I have managed the city of Dresden’s rose gardens. I have one running credit with your bank—€700 for professional pruning tools—which I have serviced flawlessly at €45 per month. I now seek €1,258 to purchase a small greenhouse and seedlings to launch a weekend rose-selling business. My net wage is €1,830, I own my 55 m² condo without a loan, and my only ongoing cost is €200 housing association dues. The new €50 installment fits easily within my budget. Savings are €78 at the moment, but my steady municipal job and on-time payment history demonstrate reliability. No other debts or dependents aside from my 7-year-old Labrador. Thank you for helping me cultivate extra income responsibly.  
Best regards,  
Timo Nowak

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Ahmed Hassan, 25, single, and have served as an IT security analyst at Hamburg’s tax-office for 5 years and 5 months. I have repaid every installment of my current €950 laptop loan ahead of schedule; only three payments remain. I apply for €1,258 to acquire certification exam vouchers and a small server rack so I can freelance penetration-testing for local startups. My gross salary is €2,400 (net €1,980), I own my 2-room apartment debt-free, and the requested €50 monthly charge equals 2.5 % of income. My savings balance is €63, but my property asset and stable civil-service position provide solid collateral. I have no other dependents or liabilities. Your support will allow me to expand my skills without risking my primary job. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ahmed Hassan

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Jonas Weber, 25, a single locomotive engineer employed by Deutsche Bahn for 6 years and 2 months. I have never defaulted on my existing €1,100 credit used for training fees; it matures next spring. I request €1,258 to buy a high-resolution 3-D printer and materials to start a side business producing custom model-train parts. My net income is €2,050, I live cost-free in my deceased grandmother’s mortgage-free house, and the new €50 installment is only 2.4 % of salary. My passbook holds €87, but my real-estate ownership and uninterrupted employment record vouch for my reliability. I have no other installment plans or dependents besides my 4-year-old twin nieces whom I support informally. I respectfully ask for approval so I can turn my hobby into a lawful enterprise.  
Kind regards,  
Jonas Weber
