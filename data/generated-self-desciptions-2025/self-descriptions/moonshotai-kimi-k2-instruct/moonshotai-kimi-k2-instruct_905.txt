Letter 1 – Senior Lab Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a 40-year-old senior lab technician at BioChem Analytics, married with one daughter. After 15 months without a checking account I opened one with your bank last year and have repaid my first small equipment loan on schedule every month. We still rent, but the flat is next to my daughter’s primary school and we want to stay; a new 55-inch smart television (1 386 €) will let her follow the science-channel tutorials that complement her classwork. I have been in the same job for 3 years and 4 months, earn 2 100 € net, and the 4 % installment rate leaves me 1 050 € monthly after all fixed costs. No other debts, no guarantors, no late payments—ever. The requested amount equals exactly one month’s salary and will be repaid in 12 equal installments. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Markus Keller  

Letter 2 – City Tram Driver  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I drive tram line 7 for Stadtwerke Munich, employed since November 2020. My wife and I rent a 65 m² apartment in Aubing; we own the building’s basement storage unit (legally classified as real estate) where I keep my tools. We need 1 386 € for a kitchen-radio/TV combo so my wife can follow her Spanish courses while cooking after her late shift. I have one active credit with your bank—always paid by the 3rd of the month—and no other loans anywhere. My net wage is 2 450 €; the 55 € monthly installment is 4 % of income and leaves us 1 200 € after rent and utilities. I am 40, German citizen, telephone listed under my name, and have no dependents beyond my spouse. Thank you for considering our application.  
Best regards,  
Thomas Richter  

Letter 3 – Customs Inspector  
Dear Lending Team,  
As a federal customs inspector at Hamburg port I have served 2 years and 9 months since transferring from Bremen. My pay grade A9 yields 2 300 € net; the proposed 1 386 € television for our living room will be repaid in 12 × 115.50 €—exactly 4 % of disposable income. We rent a 70 m² flat in Wilhelmsburg; the garage plot we own outright secures our residence stability. My checking account with you is 15 months old, my first consumer credit almost settled, and my credit bureau file shows zero missed payments in 22 years. Age 40, married, one son, no other debtors. Please approve the loan so we can replace our broken set before the European football finals.  
Respectfully,  
Oliver Stein  

Letter 4 – IT Support Specialist  
Dear Bank Team,  
I work as 2nd-level IT support for a 300-employee law firm, employed since January 2021. My wife and I rent in Leipzig-Lindenau; we own a small inherited garden house (real estate) 30 km outside the city. We need 1 386 € for a television to stream the physiotherapy exercises our daughter requires after her ankle surgery. Monthly net income 2 200 €; installment 55 € equals 4 %. I have repaid my previous laptop loan with you without delay and closed it last March. No savings account, but salary is deposited with you every month, giving you full visibility. 40 years old, one child, no other liabilities, phone registered to me. Kindly grant the loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Wolf  

Letter 5 – Aircraft Mechanic  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am a certified aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik, employed 3 years and 1 month after completing my apprenticeship. My family rents a terraced house in Hamburg-Schnelsel; we hold a 1/4 share of my parents’ condominium building (real estate) in Lüneburg. We seek 1 386 € to buy a rugged kitchen television so my wife can follow her online bakery courses while caring for our 5-year-old son. Net salary 2 600 €; 55 € installment is 4 %. I have one running credit with your bank—paid punctually for 15 months. No other debts, no guarantors, telephone listed. I am 40, German national, and have never overdrawn any account. I appreciate your quick approval so we can install the set before her next exam.  
With thanks,  
Jan-Hendrik Voigt
