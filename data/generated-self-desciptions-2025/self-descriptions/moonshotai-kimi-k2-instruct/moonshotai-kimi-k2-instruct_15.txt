Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anton Petrov, a 60-year-old Bulgarian warehouse porter who has unloaded trucks at Hoffmann Logistics for the past eight years. I live alone in the small terraced house I bought 25 years ago and support my 12-year-old granddaughter, Maria, after her parents moved back to Sofia. My current account is overdrawn by 89 DM, yet every month I pay 250 DM rent-to-own for our refrigerator and 150 DM to the local credit union; I have never missed a payment. I need 1,199 DM to replace my 1987 Golf that died last month—without a car I cannot reach the night shift that starts at 4 a.m. My net salary is 1,430 DM, so the requested 4 % installment (48 DM) is easily covered. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have lived at the same address for four years. Please help me keep my job and provide for Maria.

Respectfully,
Anton Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Luis Ferreira, 60, Portuguese national, single, and resident of Germany for 11 years. Since 2015 I have worked as an unskilled cleaner at St.-Antonius-Hospital, currently earning 1,500 DM net. My checking account shows a 120 DM overdraft, and my savings book holds 80 DM. I apply for 1,199 DM to buy a new small car—my 1989 Opel rusted through its TÜV inspection, and night buses do not reach my 4 a.m. shift. I have lived in my own apartment for four years, own no property beyond the vehicle, and have no other installment plans. My budget leaves 400 DM free each month, so the 48 DM payment is safe. I have repaid two previous small loans at this bank on time and ask for your trust once more.

Sincerely,
Luis Ferreira

Dear Team,

My name is Stanislaw Nowak, Polish citizen, 60, unmarried, and employed since 2014 as a janitor at Rhein-Neckar High School. My wages are 1,380 DM after tax. My account is 55 DM in the red, and I have 60 DM in savings. I need 1,199 DM for a new Dacia Logan to replace my wrecked 1990 Polo; without it I cannot drive my disabled sister to dialysis three times a week. I have no other creditors, no dependents besides her, and I have owned my small row-house for 15 years. The 48 DM monthly installment equals 3.5 % of my income. I have always honored my two existing credits with your bank and pledge to do the same here.

With thanks,
Stanislaw Nowak

Dear Loan Department,

I am Radu Ionescu, Romanian, 60, single, living in my own modest flat in Mannheim since 2019. I have swept factory floors at Bauer Metall for the past seven years and take home 1,340 DM. My checking balance is minus 70 DM, and my savings passbook shows 40 DM. I seek 1,199 DM to purchase a new Kia Picanto; my previous car was totaled by a hit-and-run driver, and public transport cannot get me to the 5 a.m. shift. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and my only dependent is my cat. The proposed 48 DM installment fits easily within my 300 DM monthly surplus. I have successfully repaid two earlier loans from your institution and request your support again.

Yours faithfully,
Radu Ionescu

Dear Madam or Sir,

My name is Giorgos Dimitriou, Greek national, 60, divorced, residing in my own little house in Käfertal for four years. I have worked as an unskilled kitchen assistant at the Athens Grill since 2013, earning 1,360 DM net. My checking account is overdrawn by 95 DM, and I have 90 DM in a savings account. I apply for 1,199 DM to buy a new Suzuki Alto—my 1988 Mercedes failed its inspection, and I must deliver catering orders before 6 a.m. I have no other installment obligations, no guarantors, and I support only myself. The 48 DM payment represents 3.5 % of my income, well below my 350 DM disposable margin. I have never missed a payment on my two existing credits with your bank and promise the same reliability now.

Respectfully,
Giorgos Dimitriou
