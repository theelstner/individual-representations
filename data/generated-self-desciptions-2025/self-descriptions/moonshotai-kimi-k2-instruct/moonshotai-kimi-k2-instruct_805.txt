1. Letter from Dr. Mario Silva, Veterinary Field Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting €976 to replace the portable ultrasound unit that was stolen from my truck last month. For twelve years I have vaccinated cattle on 400 farms across Alentejo; my last two bank credits were paid ahead of schedule. I earn €1 850 net, own my house and a 2016 van, and have no other debts. The new device will let me serve an extra 60 farms this season, guaranteeing repayment within 18 months. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Mario Silva  

2. Letter from Mr. Jian Li, Metro Signal Maintainer  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need €976 for a television and digital antenna so my eight-year-old daughter can follow the school’s online Mandarin lessons. I have kept the Lisbon Metro’s green line running for nine years; my payslips show €1 780 steady income. I already repaid two previous credits at your bank and live rent-free in my own apartment. The monthly installment of €39 fits easily into my budget. Please approve the loan so my child does not fall behind.  
Sincerely,  
Jian Li  

3. Letter from Mr. Ousmane Touré, Hospital Sterile-Supply Supervisor  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am asking for €976 to buy a small television for my elderly mother in Guinea; it is her only window to the world during dialysis. I have worked in Cascais Hospital’s sterilization unit for eight years, earning €1 920 net. My last two bank credits were settled without delay, and I have no other obligations. The proposed €39 monthly payment leaves me ample margin. Granting this loan will let me honor my mother while keeping my perfect repayment record.  
Gratefully,  
Ousmane Touré  

4. Letter from Mr. Dmytro Koval, Municipal Electrician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I request €976 to replace my broken field radio, essential for coordinating night repairs on Porto's public lighting. I have been employed by the city for ten years and take home €1 810. I have already repaid two prior credits with your institution and own my apartment and 2015 motorcycle. The installment of €39 represents 2 % of my income, so repayment is secure. Please approve the loan so I can keep the streets safely lit.  
Best regards,  
Dmytro Koval  

5. Letter from Mr. Rajesh Patel, CNC Machinist  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am seeking €976 to purchase a television for my son’s university online courses in mechanical design. I have operated CNC lathes at AutoParts Lda for seven years, with a net salary of €1 760. My two previous credits with your bank were paid off early, and I have no other debts. The monthly €39 installment is well below my disposable income. I have lived in the same owned flat for four years and can offer my 2017 car as additional security. Thank you for considering my application.  
Kind regards,  
Rajesh Patel
