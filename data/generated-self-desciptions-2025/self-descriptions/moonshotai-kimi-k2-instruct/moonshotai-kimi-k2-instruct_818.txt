Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stanislaw Nowak, 62, a Ukrainian laboratory technician who has worked for the Max-Planck-Institute in Cologne for the past three years after arriving in Germany. My net salary is 1 650 € and I own the small row-house in Frechen that I have lived in for four years. I need 1 338 € to replace the 14-year-old refrigerator that broke last week; without it I lose the food I prepare for my ten-year-old daughter. I have no checking account, but my savings book shows 780 € and I have never missed the 45 € monthly payment on the 2 000 € personal loan I took from your bank eighteen months ago. I can comfortably add another 45 € a month, so the proposed installment rate of 1 is exactly what I already handle. The house is debt-free and stands as security. Please approve the loan; my daughter and I would be most grateful.  
Respectfully,  
Stanislaw Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Luis Ortega, divorced, 62, Spanish national, and senior CNC operator at Bosch Reutlingen since March 2021. I earn 2 200 € net and have lived in my own terraced house in Pliezhausen since 2020. I am applying for 1 338 € to buy a new induction stove; the old gas unit leaks and the chimney sweep has forbidden its further use. I have no checking account, but my savings passbook holds 920 € and my only existing credit with you—taken in 2022 for a washing machine—has been repaid on time every month. I can assign 45 € monthly without strain, have no other debts, and my property is unencumbered. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
I am Dr. Arjun Patel, 62, Indian chemist and licensed hazardous-materials inspector at BASF Ludwigshafen since 2020. My residence is a paid-off condominium in Mannheim-Neckarau that I have occupied for four years. I seek 1 338 € to purchase an energy-efficient washer-dryer; my current machine flooded the bathroom and was written off. Although I have no checking account, my savings balance is 830 € and I have never been late on the 55 € monthly payment of the 2 500 € climate-control loan I already service with you. Adding 45 € for the new credit keeps total installments below 10 % of my 1 900 € net salary. I would appreciate your consent.  
With thanks,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Bank Officers,  
My name is Mikhail Petrov, 62, Russian master welder at Thyssenkrupp Duisburg since April 2021. I am divorced and support my 12-year-old son. We live in my own single-family home in Rheinhausen, bought outright in 2020. I apply for 1 338 € to install a modern electric boiler; the old one ruptured and scalding water endangers my child. I have no checking account, but my savings book shows 650 € and my record with you is spotless: the 1 800 € furniture loan granted in late 2021 is being repaid dutifully at 50 € monthly. The proposed 45 € installment fits easily within my 1 750 € net wage. Kindly grant the loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Mikhail Petrov

Esteemed Committee,  
I am Giuseppe Rossi, 62, Italian national and certified refrigeration technician at Liebherr Ehingen since February 2021. I reside in my own semi-detached house in Munderkingen, which I have occupied for four years. I request 1 338 € to replace the defective dishwasher and microwave—both essential for the small catering business my daughter runs from our home. I hold no checking account, yet my savings passbook contains 890 € and I have never missed the 40 € monthly payment on the 1 500 € scooter loan I took from your bank in 2022. An additional 45 € per month is well within my 1 800 € net income. I kindly ask for approval.  
Respectfully,  
Giuseppe Rossi
