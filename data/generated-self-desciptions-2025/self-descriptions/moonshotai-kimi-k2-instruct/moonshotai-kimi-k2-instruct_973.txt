Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Adnan Hadžić, a Bosnian warehouse porter who has unloaded containers at the Port of Hamburg for the past 3 years. I need €7,393 to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can drive my two sons—Amar (9) and Dino (7)—to school and still reach my 5 a.m. shift. Since arriving in Germany four years ago I have never missed a rent payment on our small row-house in Harburg; the mortgage-style building-society contract I took out in 2020 now shows €2,400 saved toward eventual purchase. My only existing credit—€3,000 for household goods—has been repaid on schedule every month; the bank’s own records show zero arrears. With net earnings of €1,850 and monthly living costs of €950, the requested €309 installment equals 17 % of disposable income, well inside safe margins. I ask for your trust so my family can keep building a stable German future.  
Respectfully,  
Adnan Hadžić

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petru Iliescu, 43, Romanian machine-line operator at the Dr. Oetker plant in Lüneburg since February 2021. After 28 months of flawless payments on my €4,500 furniture loan, I apply for €7,393 to replace our 1999 Opel that died last month. My wife and I raise our nephews—Andrei and Mihai—both in primary school; the boys walk 3 km each way because public transport to the village of Bardowick is limited. Net household income is €2,040; housing is free because we own the tiny prefab inherited from my late mother, kept insured by a life-policy with €8,000 cash value. No other debts, no phone bills—just the proposed €309 car payment, 15 % of income. Grant me this loan and I will continue to honor every deadline as I have done since my first day in Germany.  
Sincerely,  
Petru Iliescu

Dear Team,  
My name is Bakary Diallo, Malian janitor at the University of Cologne since May 2020. I am requesting €7,393 to buy a new VW Polo that will let me reach night shifts and drive my disabled brother Mamadou to physiotherapy. Although I hold no checking account, my payroll is deposited to a basic card account; my first bank loan—€5,000 for medical equipment—has been serviced perfectly for 24 months. I live rent-free in the Neubrück apartment I bought via a building-society savings plan started in 2016; the accruing balance now stands at €6,100. With net pay of €1,780, dependents’ benefits of €408, and monthly expenses of €900, the €309 installment represents only 14 % of available funds. I have never asked for a deferral and I will not start now.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Bakary Diallo

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Yevhen Kovalenko, Ukrainian slaughterhouse worker in Rendsburg, employed since April 2021. My current €3,800 television loan will be settled in July, again without a single late day; I now seek €7,393 to purchase a new Škoda Fabia Combi so my daughters—Olena (11) and Nadiya (6)—can travel safely to school through rural Schleswig-Holstein winters. Gross monthly income is €2,300; after tax and child benefits net cash is €1,950. We own our small terraced house via a building-society contract signed in 2019—current saver balance €5,500—hence no rent. The requested €309 installment equals 16 % of net cash flow, leaving ample room for living costs and contingencies. I respectfully ask for approval so my family can continue integrating productively into German society.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Yevhen Kovalenko

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Le Van Nguyen, Vietnamese kitchen assistant at the Munich Hofbräuhaus, employed since March 2021. After repaying a €3,000 household loan punctually for 24 months, I apply for €7,393 to buy a new Kia Picanto so I can accept extra late shifts and still collect my twin daughters Linh and Mai from after-school care. My net wage is €1,900; we live mortgage-free in the 50 m² flat acquired through a building-society savings tariff opened 2017 (current value €5,950). Monthly living costs total €950, leaving €950 disposable; the €309 car payment therefore claims 32 % of the surplus, comfortably within prudent limits. I possess no other credits, no phone contract, and no history of missed payments. Please approve this loan so I can keep supporting my family and contributing to Germany’s hospitality sector.  
Kind regards,  
Le Van Nguyen
