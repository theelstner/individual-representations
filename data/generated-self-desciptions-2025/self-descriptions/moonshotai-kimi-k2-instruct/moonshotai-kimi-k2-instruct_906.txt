Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lars Baumann, 36, single father of a 9-year-old boy and self-employed e-commerce logistics consultant. Since 2015 I have run my one-person GmbH from the small house I own in Leipzig; the property is debt-free and serves as my office and residence. My turnover has grown steadily and my tax adviser can confirm that all previous bank credits, including the €3 000 equipment loan I took from you in 2021, were repaid on the dot. I now need €1 278 to replace the failing studio equipment I use to record training videos for clients. My business account shows a stable monthly surplus of roughly €600 and my disposable income after all fixed costs is €1 050, so the requested instalment of €51.12 (4 % of the loan) is easily covered. Savings are thin because I prioritised paying off the mortgage, but the property is tangible collateral and my payment record speaks for itself. I would appreciate the chance to strengthen my professional setup and continue to grow my business without touching my son’s school-fee reserve. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Lars Baumann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing as Dr. Andreas Steiner, 36, unmarried, senior scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio-astronomy in Bonn since January 2016. My salary is paid into a savings account at a cooperative bank, hence I hold no checking account with you, but I have serviced my existing €2 500 computer-loan with your bank flawlessly for 24 months. I now request €1 278 to purchase a professional software-defined-radio receiver and a large 4 K monitor essential for analysing telescope data. My net income is €2 340; after rent, utilities and the current loan instalment I retain €1 120, so the new monthly payment of €51.12 represents only 4 % of the credit and less than 5 % of my free cash. I own my apartment outright and have no other debts or dependants besides my 6-year-old daughter. I enclose the institute’s confirmation of permanent employment and my last three salary slips. Your support will allow me to finish the survey that underpins our upcoming grant proposal. Thank you very much.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Andreas Steiner

Dear Team,  
My name is Markus Hoffmann, 36, single, and for the past 8 years I have worked as a police officer (first lieutenant) at Hamburg’s airport. I live in my own terraced house which I bought in April this year; the mortgage is with another bank and is budgeted separately. I have no checking account with you but have repaid a €1 500 consumer credit punctually every month since 2022. I am applying for €1 278 to buy my sister a sturdy laptop and broadcasting headset so she can start her online radio show; this is a gift to help her re-enter the workforce after illness. My net salary is €2 480; after fixed costs I have €1 200 available, so the instalment of €51.12 is easily manageable. I carry no other instalment plans and have no co-debtors. My payroll office can confirm permanent civil-servant status and my personnel file shows zero disciplinary remarks. I would be grateful if you could approve the loan at the earliest convenience.  
Kind regards,  
Markus Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Franziska Meyer, 36, divorced, and the owner of a small but profitable management consultancy in Munich. Although my business account is held elsewhere, I have serviced an existing €5 000 working-capital credit with your bank without delay for the past 24 months. I need €1 278 to replace the ageing smart-screen in my conference room that I use for client presentations and webinars. My taxable income averaged €55 000 over the last three years; my monthly free liquidity after private and company costs is €1 400, so the proposed instalment of €51.12 fits comfortably within the 4 % margin. I have owned my condominium since 2017 and have no other loans or dependants except my 8-year-old son. You are welcome to inspect my audited financial statements and the land-register extract. Granting this modest loan will help me maintain the professional appearance that keeps my client list growing. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Franziska Meyer

Dear Madam,  
Allow me to introduce myself: Thomas Richter, 36, single, certified master electrician and self-employed solar-system project manager. I have run my business from my debt-free house in Dresden for exactly 7 years and have never missed a payment on the €3 500 vehicle loan I took from your institution in 2022. I am requesting €1 278 to acquire a high-resolution drone with camera for roof inspections and marketing footage. My average monthly profit after taxes is €1 650; my household surplus is €1 050, so the instalment of €51.12 equals barely 5 % of available funds. I hold no other credits, no co-debtors, and my property is unencumbered. My accountant will provide profit-loss statements and the tax office has confirmed my VAT status is clean. The new equipment will shorten project preparation time and help me bid for larger commercial roofs. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive reply.  
Best regards,  
Thomas Richter
