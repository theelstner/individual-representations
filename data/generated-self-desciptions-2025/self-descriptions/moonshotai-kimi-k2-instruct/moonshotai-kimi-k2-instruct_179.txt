Letter 1 – Herr Armin Kulik, Radio Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 338 DM to replace the studio receiver that was stolen from my workshop last week. For eight years I have serviced transmitters for Rundfunk Brandenburg; my net pay is 2 100 DM monthly. Though my checking account is presently 120 DM overdrawn, I have 750 DM in a savings passbook that I have built up during the past four years. I own my apartment in Prenzlauer Berg and have lived there since 1990; the mortgage is paid off. My only dependent is my 14-year-old daughter. I have never missed a payment on my two existing credits with your bank (a 2 500 DM car loan and a 1 200 DM equipment loan). With 4 % of my income free for servicing debt, the new installment of 13.50 DM monthly is easily covered. I am a Latvian citizen with an unlimited residence permit and have been with the same employer since 1983. Thank you for considering this modest loan; I remain ready to provide any further information you may need.  
Respectfully,  
Armin Kulik  

Letter 2 – Herr Arno Metzger, Warehouse Foreman  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing to obtain 338 DM for a colour television so that my elderly mother can watch her favourite programmes when she moves in with me next month. I have worked as a foreman in the central warehouse of the Stadtwerke München since 1982 and earn 2 450 DM net. My checking account is temporarily 85 DM in the red, but my savings book holds 920 DM. I have lived in my own terraced house in Giesing since 1986; the property is debt-free except for the two small credits I already service with your bank (a 3 000 DM personal loan and a 1 100 DM car loan). No other debts or guarantors exist. At 52, single and with one son studying in Augsburg, I can comfortably devote 4 % of my income to the requested installment of 13.50 DM. I have been a German resident since immigrating from Poland in 1975 and hold an unlimited work permit. I would appreciate your approval so that my mother can feel at home immediately.  
Yours faithfully,  
Arno Metzger  

Letter 3 – Herr Andreas Berger, Chemical-Plant Operator  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am applying for 338 DM to buy a portable television for my night-shift rest room so that my team can stay updated during on-call hours. I have been employed as a chemical-plant operator at BASF Ludwigshafen since 1980, with a net wage of 2 300 DM. My checking account shows a 200 DM overdraft, yet my savings balance is 650 DM. I have owned my row house in Limburgerhof since 1986; no mortgage remains. My two running credits with your bank (a 2 800 DM motorcycle loan and a 1 000 DM holiday loan) have always been paid on time. The proposed monthly installment of 13.50 DM represents exactly 4 % of my disposable income, well within my budget. I am a single 52-year-old father of a 12-year-old daughter and have no other obligations. As an Austrian citizen working in Germany since 1976, I possess an unlimited residence permit. I kindly ask for prompt approval so the set can be installed before the new shift schedule begins.  
Sincerely,  
Andreas Berger  

Letter 4 – Herr Arsen Kowalski, Tram Driver  
To the Credit Committee,  
I seek 338 DM to purchase a television for my parents in Poland; I visit them every six weeks and would like to bring the set next month. I have driven trams for the Frankfurt Verkehrsgesellschaft since 1979 and earn 2 150 DM net. My checking account is 90 DM overdrawn, but my savings passbook shows 800 DM. I have lived in my own apartment in Höchst since 1986; the property is unencumbered. My two existing credits with your bank (a 2 600 DM car loan and a 1 300 DM furniture loan) have never been late. The new installment of 13.50 DM equals 4 % of my income, which I can readily afford. I am 52, divorced, and support one daughter who is completing her apprenticeship. As a Polish national with an unlimited German work permit since 1975, I have stable residence and employment. I would be grateful for your favourable decision at your earliest convenience.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Arsen Kowalski  

Letter 5 – Herr Armin Hofmann, Senior Laboratory Assistant  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am requesting 338 DM to replace my defective television before the start of the summer semester, as I use educational programmes for my continuing-studies coursework. Since 1981 I have worked as a senior laboratory assistant at the Technical University of Berlin, earning 2 200 DM net. My checking account is currently 150 DM overdrawn, while my savings book holds 700 DM. I have resided in my own small house in Spandau since 1986; it is fully paid for. My two existing credits with your bank (a 2 700 DM car loan and a 1 150 DM computer loan) are serviced without fail. The additional monthly burden of 13.50 DM represents 4 % of my net income and fits easily into my budget. I am a single 52-year-old man with one dependent son aged 16. As a Swiss citizen I have held an unlimited residence and work permit for Germany since 1976. I thank you for considering my application and stand ready to supply any further details required.  
With best regards,  
Armin Hofmann
