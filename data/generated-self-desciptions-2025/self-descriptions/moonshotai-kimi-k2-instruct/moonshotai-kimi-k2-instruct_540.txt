Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Aram Khatib, 42, a Syrian research associate in renewable-energy diagnostics at the Fraunhofer Institute, employed since 2015. My net salary is 3 200 € and my checking account currently shows –80 € because I just paid nursery costs for my 6-year-old daughter. I have serviced my first bank loan (7 000 € for household goods) punctually for 37 months; the new 7 763 € loan will complete the purchase of a VW e-up that I need to reach measurement sites in rural Brandenburg. My installment-to-income ratio is 4 %, well within the 20 % guideline, and my open-ended contract guarantees repayment until 2028. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Aram Khatib

I have no other debts, no property to sell, and my daughter and I live rent-free in my sister’s flat. I guarantee disciplined repayment as with my previous credit.
