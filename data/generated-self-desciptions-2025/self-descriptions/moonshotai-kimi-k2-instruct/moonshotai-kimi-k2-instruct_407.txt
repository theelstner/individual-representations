Letter 1 – Apprentice Electronics Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 22, married, and finish my apprenticeship at SATURN Berlin in two months. My wife and I have just rented a small flat; the landlord supplied the kitchen, but we have no TV or radio. A loan of 2,039 DM would let me buy a solid Grundig colour set (1,890 DM) and a small radio (149 DM) so my wife can continue her distance-course French lessons every evening. My take-home pay is 1,380 DM; after 690 DM rent and 300 DM living costs I have 390 DM free, so the requested 85 DM monthly instalment is no problem. I have repaid my first 1,000 DM consumer credit at this bank on time every month; savings are still under 100 DM because we just paid the removal costs. No other debts, no guarantors, telephone in my own name. I will start as a fully qualified technician on 1 August (already signed) and keep the same employer, so income security is guaranteed. Thank you for helping a young couple set up their first home.  
Respectfully,  
Martin Keller  

Letter 2 – Junior Lab Assistant, University of Cologne  
Dear Credit Team,  
I am 22, married, and have worked as a scientific research assistant at the university’s pharmaceutical lab for eight months. My wife and I bought a tiny row-house in Porz; we own it, but it is empty of appliances. Because we expect our first child in December we urgently need a television and a radio for news and relaxation; the requested 2,039 DM covers a 66-cm Sharp TV, a Sanyo kitchen radio and installation cables. My salary is 1,420 DM net; our only housing cost is 120 DM building-society interest, leaving 1,300 DM for living and credit service. The 85 DM instalment equals 6 % of income, well below the 25 % ceiling. My previous 1,500 DM computer loan with you has been paid back duly every month; savings are still under 100 DM because we just paid the notary. No other debts, no co-signers, telephone registered under my name. My contract runs until 31 December 2000 and will be renewed because the project is prolonged. Please approve the loan so my family can move in before the baby arrives.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Schmitt  

Letter 3 – Trainee Bank Teller  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am 22, married, and have served as a trainee bank official at this branch since last October. My wife and I just moved into our own small apartment in Düsseldorf; we need a television and radio to keep up with financial news and language courses. The loan of 2,039 DM will finance a Panasonic TV (1,650 DM) and a Blaupunkt stereo radio (389 DM). My trainee salary is 1,300 DM net; after 650 DM housing costs and 250 DM food we still have 400 DM discretionary, so the 85 DM monthly payment is comfortable. I have repaid my 1,200 DM furniture loan here without delay; savings remain under 100 DM because we used them for the removal van. No other instalment plans, no guarantors, telephone listed in my name. My employment becomes permanent in January 2000, ensuring continuity of income. I would be grateful if my own bank could support its trainee with this small loan.  
Best regards,  
Felix Braun  

Letter 4 – Skilled CNC Turner  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 22, married, and have worked as a CNC turner at BMW’s Munich plant for eleven months. We recently bought a modest condominium in Unterhaching; the flat is empty, and we need a television and radio to feel at home. A loan of 2,039 DM will cover a 59-cm Sony Trinitron (1,790 DM) and a Roberts world-band radio (249 DM). My wage after tax is 1,480 DM; housing costs 700 DM, living 350 DM, leaving 430 DM free. The 85 DM instalment is only 5.7 % of income. My 1,100 DM motorcycle loan at your bank has been paid back on time every month; savings are still under 100 DM because we just paid the agent’s fee. No other debts, no co-debtors, telephone in my name. My employment is secure: I passed my probation and the plant is expanding. Please approve the loan so my wife and I can enjoy our first own home.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Weber  

Letter 5 – Registered Nurse, Municipal Hospital  
Dear Lending Officer,  
I am 22, widowed, and have worked as a certified nurse at St.-Elisabeth Hospital in Hamburg for nine months. After my wife’s death I moved into a small owned apartment; the rooms are bare and I need a television and radio to unwind after night shifts. The requested 2,039 DM will buy a 61-cm Samsung TV (1,750 DM) and a Grundig short-wave radio (289 DM). My net pay is 1,550 DM; housing costs 600 DM, food 300 DM, leaving 650 DM available. The 85 DM instalment represents 5.5 % of income. My previous 1,300 DM relocation loan with you has been serviced punctually; savings are under 100 DM because I sent money to my late wife’s family. No other credits, no guarantors, telephone registered under my name. My contract is unlimited from 1 October. I would appreciate your support in helping me rebuild my life.  
Respectfully,  
Daniel Richter
