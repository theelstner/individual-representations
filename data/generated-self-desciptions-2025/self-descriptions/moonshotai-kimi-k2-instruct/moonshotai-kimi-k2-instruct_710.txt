Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ana Petrova, 25, a Ukrainian laboratory technician at Westphalia Medical GmbH for the past eight years. My net salary is 1 450 DM and I own my small row-house in Dortmund. I need 1 206 DM to replace our broken television so that my seven-year-old daughter can follow her school’s educational programmes. My current checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 95 DM, yet every prior loan—one for 2 000 DM last year—has been repaid ahead of schedule. The requested instalment of 48 DM over four years equals only 3 % of my income, well within my budget. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my residence and employment are both stable since 2015. Please approve the loan; my payroll slips and land-registry extract are enclosed.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Leyla Yilmaz, Turkish electronics assembler at RheinTech for eight years, monthly net 1 380 DM. I am divorced and raise my five-year-old son in my own flat in Cologne. My only bank account shows 150 DM and my savings passbook 80 DM, but I have never missed a payment on my existing 1 500 DM car loan. I ask for 1 206 DM to buy a sturdy colour television so my child can practise German with educational broadcasts. The 48 DM monthly payment is 3.5 % of my salary and will be transferred automatically. I enclose my open-ended contract, last three wage statements, and land title. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Team,

I seek 1 206 DM for a television set so my separated husband and I can share custody viewing with our daughter in the house I own in Leverkusen. The 48 DM instalment represents 3.2 % of my income. No other debts exist, and my job and address are unchanged for eight and four years respectively. Kindly approve the credit; my wage slips and property deed are attached.  
Best regards,
