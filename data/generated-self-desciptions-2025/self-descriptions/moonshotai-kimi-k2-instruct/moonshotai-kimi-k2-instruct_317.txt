Letter 1 – Arben Kovaçi, laboratory technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 2,746 DM to replace the broken steriliser and microscope in my home-based science-tutoring room. For eight years I have been a scientific research assistant at the city water-testing lab; my net pay is 2,050 DM and has never arrived late. My only prior loan—taken in 2018 for my Citroën—was paid off last month, three months early. I live in my late parents’ house which I inherited; overheads are minimal and my ten-year-old daughter and I have no other debts. I have kept the same current account with you since 2016; although the balance is presently –45 DM, my salary next week will restore it to the black. A monthly debit of 78 DM (4 % of income) is easily covered. Kindly approve the loan so my students can continue learning with proper equipment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Arben Kovaçi  

Letter 2 – Florian Berger, master baker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 2,746 DM to buy a professional dough-sheeter for my one-man bakery. I have worked as a certified baker for nine years and opened my own shop four years ago; turnover has doubled each year. My taxable income is 2,300 DM monthly and my house is mortgage-free. The only credit I ever took—your 2019 car loan—was repaid without a single reminder. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 30 DM after ingredient purchases, but cash flow always recovers within days. I can comfortably service the proposed 78 DM installment and have no other obligations. The new machine will let me supply two additional cafés, securing the repayment. I appreciate your support.  
Sincerely,  
Florian Berger  

Letter 3 – Mehmet Yıldız, automotive painter  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am applying for 2,746 DM to furnish my newly adopted six-year-old son’s room: bed, desk and computer so he can attend online schooling. I have been a senior paint-shop technician at AutoPartner GmbH for ten years, earning 2,180 DM net. My 2017 car loan with you was paid punctually every month; the account closed with a thank-you letter from your collections unit. Although my current account shows –12 DM today, my wage credit next Friday will clear it. I own my apartment outright and have no other loans or guarantors. The requested installment of 78 DM represents 3.6 % of my income, well below your 4 % guideline. Please help me give my boy a proper home.  
Gratefully,  
Mehmet Yıldız  

Letter 4 – Darko Novak, train dispatcher  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I seek 2,746 DM to purchase a reliable used car for my daily 60 km commute after my old vehicle was totaled. Employed by the federal railway as a signal-box dispatcher since 2012, I take home 2,400 DM and have never missed a payment on the 2018 car loan you granted; the final installment was honored last spring. My savings booklet holds 90 DM, enough for small emergencies, and my house is debt-free. The checking account is overdrawn 25 DM only until the mid-month salary post. I am single, raise my eight-year-old niece, and have no other debts or co-signers. A monthly debit of 78 DM is easily manageable. Your approval will keep me punctual for shifts and ensure continued reliable service.  
Best regards,  
Darko Novak  

Letter 5 – Petru Ionescu, refrigeration mechanic  
Dear Madam,  
I am requesting 2,746 DM to buy energy-efficient tools and a workbench so I can start evening service calls and boost income. I have been a certified refrigeration mechanic for eleven years, currently staff at KälteTech AG, where I earn 2,220 DM net. My record shows perfect repayment of my 2017 vehicle loan through your bank. My checking account dips to –38 DM only because I recently paid municipal taxes; my salary in four days will restore credit. I live in my own terraced house, have no other loans, and support only my ten-year-old son. The proposed 78 DM monthly payment equals 3.5 % of income, leaving ample room for living costs. I am ready to sign any required direct-debit order and will maintain my impeccable repayment history. Thank you for trusting me.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petru Ionescu
