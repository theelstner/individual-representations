Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request a 2,406 DM loan to buy a commercial-grade sewing machine and cutting table for my one-woman tailoring business. After four-and-a-half years as a seamstress at ModaWerk GmbH I opened my own atelier last year; my single existing bank loan has been repaid on schedule every month. My salary averages 1,750 DM net, my rent is 420 DM, and my only dependent is my five-year-old daughter. Although my checking account is presently overdrawn 200 DM and my savings hold only 80 DM, I own the small apartment house I inherited from my grandmother; it is debt-free and valued at 180,000 DM. The new equipment will let me accept larger uniform contracts from local hotels, raising my monthly profit by at least 350 DM, easily covering the 97 DM installment. I have lived at the same address for four years, have no other debts, and as a foreign citizen I have never missed a payment to the German tax or social-insurance authorities. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Elena M.

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dr. Carla Schulze, laboratory manager at WestLab Diagnostics, and I am applying for 2,406 DM to furnish a home office with ergonomic furniture and a secure sample-storage cabinet. I have worked six years in my current position, earning 2,100 DM net, and my only bank loan has been serviced punctually. My checking account is temporarily 150 DM overdrawn after moving to a new rental flat last month; savings are 90 DM. I rent, but I co-own a condominium with my sister that is fully paid off. The requested credit will be repaid at 97 DM monthly—4 % of my disposable income—well within the bank’s guidelines. As a divorced mother of one school-age child I budget carefully, have no other installment plans, and possess a spotless credit record. Your support will allow me to meet EU safety standards when reviewing overnight test results from home.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Carla Schulze

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Franziska Nowak, 23, senior pharmacy technician at City-Apotheke, and I seek 2,406 DM to purchase professional-grade laboratory stools, adjustable desks, and a laminar-flow hood for the private training courses I run for nursing students. Employed for five years and eight months, I earn 1,680 DM net. My current overdraft of 180 DM will be cleared by next month’s salary; savings stand at 70 DM. I rent a 380-DM apartment and co-own, mortgage-free, a family house in the countryside worth 220,000 DM. My only existing loan with your bank is nearly repaid; all installments have been met on time. The new equipment will increase my teaching income by roughly 300 DM monthly, comfortably covering the 97 DM repayment. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have resided at my present address for four years. Thank you for helping me expand a small educational venture that benefits regional healthcare.  
Yours faithfully,  
Franziska Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
As a certified IT network administrator at DataSecure GmbH for the past six years, I apply for 2,406 DM to buy height-adjustable desks, ergonomic chairs, and a server rack for my freelance cybersecurity consultancy. My net salary is 1,900 DM; my checking account shows a 220 DM overdraft due to recent relocation, and my savings account holds 60 DM. I rent a 400-DM flat but own a half-share of a debt-free rental property yielding 350 DM monthly. My sole bank loan has never been late. The new furniture will let me host corporate clients at home, adding an estimated 400 DM profit per month and easily covering the 97 DM installment. I have no dependents besides my cat, no telephone at home, and as a Polish national I have maintained impeccable payment records since arriving in Germany. I appreciate your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Patrycja Lewandowska

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Aisha Hadžić, production-line supervisor at BioVeg GmbH, where I have worked for five years and four months. I am requesting 2,406 DM to purchase stainless-steel kitchen furniture and a high-capacity blender for developing vegan spreads that I plan to sell at weekend markets. My take-home pay is 1,730 DM; my checking account is 170 DM overdrawn and my savings balance is 95 DM. I rent a small apartment for 390 DM, but I inherited a ¼ share of a family house currently valued at 240,000 DM with no encumbrances. My existing bank loan has been repaid without fail; the proposed 97 DM monthly installment equals 4 % of my net income. I have no other debts, no co-borrowers, and have lived in the same building for four years. The equipment will allow me to triple my side-business output and generate at least 350 DM additional profit each month. Thank you for supporting a young woman’s entrepreneurial step.  
Kind regards,  
Aisha Hadžić
