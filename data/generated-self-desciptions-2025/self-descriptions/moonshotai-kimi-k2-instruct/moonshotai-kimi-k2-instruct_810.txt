Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for DM 9 283 to buy a 1998 VW Passat that will let me restart my sole-trader courier service. After 8 years as a scientific research assistant I was made redundant in January; my only income is a DM 480 orphan’s pension for my 12-year-old niece whom I raise. My checking balance is DM 180 and savings DM 95, yet my last DM 5 000 car loan was repaid on time every month. The new vehicle will restore DM 1 200 monthly turnover; the requested 42-month term at 1 % leaves DM 220 free, well within my budget. I have no other debts, live rent-free in my late mother’s flat, and can be reached at the listed land-line. Please allow me to work again.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Martin Lehmann

Dear Sirs,  
I request DM 9 283 to replace the engine of the used Sprinter that my one-man painting firm depends on. I have been self-employed as a master painter for 11 years, but since the van broke I have been technically unemployed; turnover dropped to zero last quarter. My account shows DM 150 and I hold DM 80 in savings, yet every prior bank loan—most recently DM 7 500—was settled early. The repaired van secures existing contracts worth DM 3 800 a month; the 42-month schedule at 1 % equals DM 221, which fits the household budget even while I draw DM 670 unemployment benefit. I am single, live gratis in my sister’s garage loft, own no property and have no other liabilities. Grant me the chance to invoice again.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Weber

Dear Loan Department,  
I am 55, single, and the sole carer of my 14-year-old grandson. After 9 years as a senior logistics officer I was laid off in March; my only cash is DM 190 in checking and DM 90 in savings. I need DM 9 283 to purchase a 1999 Mercedes 200 that will let me resume weekend airport shuttle runs, my proven side business that yielded DM 1 400 monthly before my old car failed. My record shows punctual repayment of a DM 6 000 vehicle loan; the proposed 42-month term at 1 % costs DM 221, affordable against DM 710 unemployment benefit and projected earnings. I reside free in a parish studio, have no property and no other debts. A reliable car is the last barrier to regaining solvency.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Franziska Hoffmann

To the Credit Team,  
As a certified tax adviser I ran a thriving practice for 12 years until a client fraud froze my accounts; I have been unemployed since February. I am asking for DM 9 283 to buy a 2000 Opel Zafira so I can travel to clients and relaunch advisory sessions. My present balance is DM 170 and savings DM 70, but my sole prior loan of DM 8 000 was honoured without delay. The 42-month plan at 1 % equals DM 221, covered by DM 650 unemployment benefit plus expected consultation fees. I live rent-free in my late aunt’s cottage, possess no real estate, and carry no other installment plans. Restoring mobility is the decisive step toward rebuilding my livelihood.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Thomas Richter

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am a 55-year-old widower and father of a university freshman. After 10 years as IT project manager I was downsized in April; my liquidity is DM 160 in checking and DM 85 in savings. I seek DM 9 283 to acquire a 1997 Audi A4 that will allow me to take up freelance database administration contracts across the state. My history with your bank is impeccable: a DM 6 500 equipment loan was repaid ahead of schedule. The requested 42-month term at 1 % costs DM 221, manageable on DM 680 unemployment benefit augmented by projected project income. I lodge gratis in my brother’s attic flat, own no property, and have no other encumbrances. Reliable transport is the key to re-entering the workforce.  
With appreciation,  
Peter Neumann
