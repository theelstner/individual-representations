Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 27, a Colombian foreign worker and single father of a 4-year-old boy. I have been a scientific-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Göttingen for the last 27 months and live in my own small row-house. After a short delay two years ago I cleared the last small credit completely; since then I have saved 1 200 DM and keep two current mini-credits (total 8613 DM) in good standing. I need a reliable used Opel Astra (1998, 5 800 DM) to reach the institute’s out-station 30 km away and to take my son to kindergarten on time. My net salary of 2 050 DM leaves 1 040 DM free each month, so the requested 230 DM installment (rate 2) is only 22 % of disposable income. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone yet—only stability and the wish to give my child a safe future. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Patel, 27, Indian national, single, and a certified CNC operator at Bosch Rexroth since 2019. Although I had a 48-day delay on a 500-DM mail-order account in 2020, I settled it in full and have since saved 1 100 DM. I own my apartment and a 125-cc Honda that serves as my only property. My two existing bank credits (together 8613 DM) have been paid flawlessly for 27 months; the new loan would replace them and add 2 500 DM to buy a 1999 used VW Polo, cutting my 45-minute bus ride to 15 minutes of driving. With 1 950 DM net salary and no dependents other than myself, the proposed 230 DM installment equals 11.8 % of income—well below the 25 % guideline. I have lived at the same address for two years and am never changing jobs; granting this loan means finishing what I started and driving to work on my own wheels. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Team,  
My name is Mikhail Petrov, 27, Russian, single, and a junior software tester at SAP for the past 28 months. In 2020 I missed two payments on a 600-DM phone contract; I cleared the debt and today hold 1 050 DM in savings. I own my studio flat and a 10-year-old bicycle—my only property. I am applying for 8613 DM to consolidate two small credits and to purchase a 2000 Seat Ibiza (6 000 DM) so I can reach customer sites 80 km away and increase my side-income tutoring. My net pay is 2 100 DM; the new 230 DM installment fits the bank’s rate-2 requirement and consumes 10.9 % of my budget. No other loans, no dependents, no guarantors, and no plans to move. I have kept the same address for two years and the same employer for almost three—stability you can count on. I kindly ask for approval.  
Best regards,  
Mikhail Petrov

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Samuel Mensah, 27, Ghanaian, single, and a ward nurse at Evangelisches Krankenhaus since November 2019. In 2020 I fell behind on a 400-DM furniture account for 60 days; I repaid it completely and now have 1 300 DM saved. I live in my own one-bedroom co-op flat and need a 8613-DM loan to close two small running credits and to buy a 1999 used Ford Fiesta (5 900 DM) so I can reach night shifts that begin at 5 a.m. when public transport is unavailable. My net salary is 2 040 DM; the requested 230 DM installment represents 11.3 % of income, matching rate 2. I have no other debts, no dependents in Germany, and have stayed at the same residence for two years. A reliable car will secure my job, and my job secures your repayment. I appreciate your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Mensah

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Zhang Wei, 27, Chinese citizen, single, and a mechanical design draftsman at Siemens Energy for 27 months. After a brief 30-day delay on a 350-DM radio bill in 2020, I rectified the default and have since built up 1 000 DM in savings. I own my small apartment and a 12-year-old e-bike—now insufficient for the 50-km commute to the new turbine site. I request 8613 DM to replace two current credits and to acquire a 2000 Skoda Felicia (6 200 DM). My net income is 2 000 DM; the 230 DM installment equals 11.5 %, fulfilling the rate-2 condition. No family here, no other loans, no guarantors, and no intention of relocating. I have lived at the same address for two years and am on a permanent contract. Approving this loan keeps a reliable engineer on the road and your instalments arriving on the dot. Thank you for your support.  
Kind regards,  
Zhang Wei
