Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Nowak, a 31-year-old Polish electronics technician who has lived and worked in Germany for the past three years. I am requesting €3,651 to buy a new VW Caddy so I can reach my night-shift job at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart, 42 km away. Since arriving I have never missed a rent or credit payment; my only existing loan with you—taken out for my tools—has been reduced from €5,000 to €1,200 in twelve months. I keep €1,150 in my savings book and own the small row house in Vaihingen that I bought through a Bauspar contract. My net income is €2,340 and my fixed costs, including the proposed €305 monthly car installment, stay below 35 % of that. Two children live with me; their mother and I share custody but no joint debt. A reliable car will let me keep the shift differential that feeds my family and continues the steady repayment record I have shown you. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 31, single, and a Spanish certified welder at Daimler-Benz since May 2021. I need €3,651 to replace my failing 1999 Golf with a new Dacia Sandero so I can commute to the Sindelfingen plant without unpredictable garage bills. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by €90 after moving into my own apartment, but my savings book holds €1,040 and my life-insurance policy has a surrender value of €4,800. The only credit I have with you—€4,000 for household appliances—has been served punctually; the balance is now €1,050. My net salary is €2,200 and the requested 12-month installment of €305 equals 14 % of that. I have lived at the same address for three years, hold an open-ended contract, and have no other dependents besides sending €300 monthly to my parents in Valencia. Granting this loan will secure my punctual attendance at work and the continued flawless payment history I have maintained.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petar Milić, a 31-year-old Croatian laboratory assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Intelligent Systems. After 26 months of employment I have just received an unlimited contract and would like to finance a new Škoda Fabia Combi for €3,651. My current car died last month; without it I spend €190 on trains and taxis, money that would cover two thirds of the loan installment. Though my checking balance shows –€65 today, my savings account holds €1,020 and my Bauspar-savings agreement has €7,300. My first loan with you—€3,500 for furniture—will be paid off next month, nine months early. My net income is €2,100, housing costs are €550, and the new credit installment of €305 keeps my debt-to-income ratio at a comfortable level. I have lived in the same Tübingen flat for three years, am single, and have no other obligations except supporting my sister’s two children while she finishes her degree. A reliable car is essential for on-call lab duties; I therefore ask for your approval so I can continue to serve the institute and repay the bank without fail.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Petar Milić

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Dmitri Volkov, 31, Russian machine setter at Mahle GmbH since November 2020. I am requesting €3,651 to purchase a new Opel Corsa, ensuring I can commute 60 km daily to keep the precision line running. My payroll is deposited into your bank; my current overdraft of €45 is temporary and will be cleared when holiday pay arrives. I maintain €1,100 in my savings book and contribute €150 monthly to a life-insurance plan worth €9,000. My only existing loan—€3,800 for language courses—has been served flawlessly and now stands at €980. With a net salary of €2,250, the proposed 12-month installment of €305 represents 13.5 % of income. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have lived in my own small house in Plochingen for three years. A dependable vehicle will let me accept upcoming shift premiums that will further strengthen my repayment capacity. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Bogdan Ionescu, a 31-year-old Romanian CNC operator at Trumpf AG, employed since April 2021. I am applying for €3,651 to buy a new Renault Twingo essential for reaching the Ditzingen factory at 5 a.m. when public transport is unavailable. Although my checking account presently shows –€55, my savings ledger holds €1,030 and my building-society contract shows €11,400, earmarked for future home expansion. My first and only loan with you—€4,200 for work equipment—has been repaid on schedule; the remaining balance is €1,100. My net wage is €2,180, rent-free because I own my apartment, and the requested monthly installment of €305 fits easily within the 40 % of income your guidelines allow. I have lived in the same residence for three years, am single, and have no dependents or other credit lines. Approving this modest loan will guarantee my punctuality at work and the continuation of my spotless payment history.  
Thank you for your support.  
Bogdan Ionescu
