Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Benali, a 27-year-old lab technician from Morocco working since last August as a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Cologne. My net salary is 1,450 DM and my checking balance is currently 186 DM. I need 1,924 DM to buy a sturdy desk, an ergonomic chair and a laptop so I can finish my data-analysis protocols at home instead of staying overnight in the lab. I have paid every installment of my existing 48-DM consumer credit on time for the past ten months and I own the small apartment building in which I live (inherited, rented out upstairs, I rent downstairs). No other debts, no guarantors, no phone yet—only my 5-year-old daughter and me. I am asking for 18 months at 4 % installment rate; the 107 DM monthly payment equals 7 % of my income, well within safe margins. Please approve the loan; my work contract is open-ended and my supervisor will confirm that my position is secure.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lena Müller, 27, divorced mother of one, employed since November as a certified pharmacy technician at Bielefeld City Hospital. My wage is 1,380 DM net and my account shows 142 DM today. I am requesting 1,924 DM to replace the broken washing machine and my daughter’s bunk bed that was damaged when our flat flooded last month. I have never missed the 55-DM payment on my current small loan (opened March 1993) and the bank can verify zero arrears. The proposed 107 DM monthly payment fits easily into my budget; I have no other installment plans and no co-debtors. Although I rent my apartment, I do own a half-share of a rental house in Minden (my parents and I inherited it), giving me long-term collateral security. After 18 months the debt will be cleared and my daughter and I can continue rebuilding our lives. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Lena Müller

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Carla Hoffmann, 27, married but living separately while my divorce proceedings conclude. I started as a junior customs officer at Frankfurt Airport three weeks ago after finishing vocational training; probationary salary is 1,520 DM. My checking account holds 174 DM and I need 1,924 DM to furnish the tiny studio I just rented so my 3-year-old son and I can move out of the women’s shelter. I have one existing credit (opened January 1993) with perfect repayment history; the new loan would run 18 months at 107 DM per month—only 7 % of income. I own no savings yet, but I hold ¼ of a family-owned duplex in Hannover which generates rental income that covers my current rent. No other debts, no guarantors, and my personnel office confirms my post is permanent after probation. I ask for your approval so we can begin our new life with dignity.  
With gratitude,  
Carla Hoffmann

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Samira Yilmaz, Turkish national, 27, separated, working since October as a CNC machinist at Stuttgart Precision Parts Ltd. My payslip is 1,400 DM net and my bank balance is 153 DM. I seek 1,924 DM to buy a used car seat, a pram and nursery furniture before my baby arrives in August. My current 60-DM loan (started December 1992) is paid promptly every month; the additional 107 DM installment represents 7.6 % of income, leaving ample room for living costs. I rent a small flat but co-own a vineyard cottage in Anatolia with my brothers; the land registry document is available. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and my foreman will attest that my skilled position is indispensable. Grant me this loan and I will repay faithfully until March 1995.  
Respectfully,  
Samira Yilmaz

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Petra Nowak, 27, divorced, mother of a 6-year-old boy, employed since December as a court clerk at the Regional Court of Dresden. My salary is 1,360 DM net and my account presently holds 195 DM. I apply for 1,924 DM to purchase a reliable washing machine, a compact kitchen unit and a study table so my son and I can stop eating on the floor. I have honored every 50-DM payment on my existing loan (opened January 1993) without delay; the new credit would add 107 DM monthly, equal to 7.9 % of income. I possess no savings yet, but I am sole owner of a 2-room condominium in Görlitz currently leased, giving me property backing. No other installment plans, no guarantors, and my chief judge will confirm my tenure is secure after probation. Please approve the 18-month loan so we can turn our rented flat into a proper home.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Nowak
