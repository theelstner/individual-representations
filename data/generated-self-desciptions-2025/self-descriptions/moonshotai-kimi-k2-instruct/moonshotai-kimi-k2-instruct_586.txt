Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request €2 133 to purchase a new Dacia Sandio that will let me reach remote farms for my veterinary practice. For the past 12 years I have been the only large-animal vet in my rural district; my income is modest but steady at €2 400 net per month and the current credit I have with your bank has always been paid on the 15th without delay. Although I have no savings account, I live rent-free in the clinic’s apartment and my only dependent is my 14-year-old daughter. At 52 I am not planning any further loans after this one; the car replaces a 1998 van that died last month and is essential for emergency calls. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can continue serving the region’s farmers.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Elena Weber

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I apply for €2 133 to buy a new Renault Kwid so I can drive to night-shifts at the regional laboratory where I have worked as senior research assistant for the past 8 years. My salary is €2 200 and my single existing credit with you is almost finished—only three installments remain and all have been honored. I divorced last year; I now live in my mother’s house without rent and have no other debts or dependents except my 10-year-old son. The car will cut my two-hour commute to thirty minutes, allowing me to accept extra shifts that increase my pay by €300 a month, more than covering the €85 monthly installment at 4 %. Thank you for considering my request.  
Best regards,  
Dr. Marta Klein

Dear Team,  
As a self-employed horticultural consultant I need €2 133 to replace my broken van with a new Fiat Panda so I can transport seedlings to clients. For 9 years I have advised 40 organic farms; last year I earned €28 000 and paid every installment of my current loan with you on time. I have no property, but I live in my sister’s guesthouse free of charge and have no other loans or guarantors. My 16-year-old niece depends on me; the new car will secure the contracts that finance her schooling. I am 52 years old, stable, and ready to sign the direct-debit mandate today.  
Yours faithfully,  
Angela Rossi

Dear Loan Department,  
I request €2 133 for a new Toyota Aygo that will allow me to keep my position as logistics officer at the municipal waste-management company, a post I have held for 11 years. My net salary is €2 500 and my sole existing credit with your bank has never been late. Living rent-free in the council flat means my disposable income easily covers the proposed €85 monthly payment at 4 %. I am divorced with one daughter aged 12 and no other financial obligations. The car is required because the night bus I currently use will be cancelled in July. I appreciate your trust and guarantee punctual repayment.  
Respectfully,  
Officer Claudia Hoffmann

Dear Madam,  
I am applying for €2 133 to purchase a new Hyundai i10. I have served as head nurse at St. Hedwig Hospital for 10 years and my salary of €2 750 is paid directly into the salary account I opened with you last year; the only existing loan I have with you is already 70 % repaid with perfect discipline. Although I have no savings, I live in the hospital’s guest wing at no cost and have no property or other debts. My 18-year-old son starts university this autumn; the car will let me visit him on weekends while continuing my shifts. At 52 I value stability and promise the same reliability with this new loan.  
Kind regards,  
Mrs. Gabriele Nowak
