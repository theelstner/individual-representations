Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for 3,249 DM to replace my 12-year-old delivery van. As the owner of “Klein’s Organic Produce” I have served 42 weekly customers without a single late delivery since 2017. My business account currently shows –68 DM because I prepaid the winter greenhouse heating; last year’s tax return shows a net profit of 28,400 DM. I have repaid every previous bank loan on the exact due date, most recently a 5,000 DM equipment loan closed last March. With no rent (I live in the apartment above my sister’s garage) and only one small bank installment of 95 DM/month, I can easily service the new 95 DM payment. The new van will let me add ten more suburban drop-off points, increasing monthly revenue by an estimated 1,100 DM. I respectfully ask for your approval and guarantee repayment as punctually as always.  
Sincerely,  
Markus Klein

Dear Loan Committee,  
I need 3,249 DM to buy a new CNG car so I can continue my work as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute, a post I have held for 6 years and 3 months. My salary is 2,450 DM net; my only obligation is a 97 DM monthly bank loan taken for my Master’s fees, always paid on time. My checking balance is –45 DM today because the annual institute conference fee was debited yesterday, yet my savings book holds 85 DM and grows by 50 DM each month. Living rent-free in my late grandmother’s house keeps costs low, and my two school-age children and I have no other debts. A reliable vehicle is essential for field sampling trips up to 300 km away. I will gladly forward my employment contract and last six salary slips to prove that the requested 36-month loan fits securely within my budget. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Thomas Werner

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am requesting 3,249 DM to purchase a new car for my self-employed courier service, active since January 2018. My income averages 2,600 DM net per month; my current account is –12 DM only because a client payment is two days late. I have already repaid two earlier bank credits (latest closed October 2022) without a single reminder. I live for free in my parents’ duplex, own no property, and have no other dependents beyond my twin nephews whom I support. The proposed 95 DM monthly installment equals 3.7 % of my income, well below the 4 % ceiling. A new vehicle will cut fuel costs by 120 DM monthly and allow me to accept medical-sample contracts that pay an extra 350 DM per month. Attached are my 2022 profit-loss statement and client references; I stand ready to provide any further proof of reliability.  
Yours faithfully,  
Oliver Seidel

Dear Loan Committee,  
I write to secure 3,249 DM for a new compact car that will safeguard my job as regional sales supervisor at BioTec GmbH, a position I have held for 5 years and 8 months. My gross salary is 3,100 DM; after support for my two dependents I retain 1,750 DM. My checking account shows –89 DM after yearly vehicle insurance debited this week, while my savings hold 60 DM. I have never missed a payment on my existing 110 DM bank loan, and the additional 95 DM would bring total installments to 205 DM, still under the bank’s 25 % limit. Public transport to our rural clients is unreliable; a dependable car is therefore mandatory under my employment contract. I enclose my last three salary statements and the HR letter confirming continued employment. I appreciate your trust and assure you of prompt repayment.  
Best regards,  
Lars Hoffmann

Dear Loan Committee,  
As a 39-year-old police officer stationed at Munich Precinct 14 for the past 6 years, I am requesting 3,249 DM to buy a new patrol-rated vehicle for my family. My net income is 2,720 DM; I live rent-free in the service apartment above the district garage. My checking balance is –76 DM after my children’s school excursion fees were deducted, and my savings book shows 90 DM. I have dutifully repaid my current 100 DM monthly bank loan and carry no other debts. The new car installment of 95 DM keeps total obligations at a manageable 195 DM. A reliable car is essential for commuting to rotating shifts and for emergency family travel. I am prepared to submit my last six payslips and a letter from my commanding officer confirming stable employment. Thank you for approving this modest loan.  
With respect,  
Martin Huber
