Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Marta Lehmann, 26, a single mother and junior lab technician at BioChem Leipzig since 2021. After paying off a small past-delayed phone bill last year, my Schufa is now clear. I need 2,764 € to buy a used PCR machine so I can start weekend DNA-test services for local beekeepers; orders are already pre-paid. My net salary is 1,550 €, rent-free because I inherited a small row-house in Reudnitz; overheads are only 250 € utilities and 90 € car insurance. I have no other loans, no co-debtor, and my 80 € savings remain untouched for emergencies. Two previous 500 € micro-loans from your bank were repaid early. I attach my employment contract, ten firm bookings for bee analyses, and a 24-month repayment schedule of 120 €/month—less than 8 % of income. Please help me turn my 4-year-old daughter’s bee drawings into her college fund.  
Respectfully,  
Marta Lehmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Leyla Yilmaz, 26, Turkish-born but now registered in Hamburg. I have worked as a certified dental assistant at Altona Practice since May 2021 and live in my own one-bedroom apartment (purchased with family help). A 2019 credit-card delay of 34 days has been settled; no other negatives exist. I request 2,764 € to complete the purchase of a CEREC CAD-CAM unit that the practice will lease back from me, generating 350 € monthly extra income. My pay slip shows 1,680 € net; housing costs are 300 €, car 70 €. I already service two small building society contracts with you, always on time. With no dependents except my cat and no other debts, I offer to repay 115 € monthly over 24 months. My residence and job are stable, and the clinic’s written lease guarantee is enclosed.  
Kind regards,  
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Franziska “Franzi” Vogel, 26, divorced mother of Jonas (5). I trained as a pharmacy technician and have been employed at CityApotheke Dresden since October 2020. My only past credit hiccup was a 60-day delay on 300 € furniture credit in 2020—paid and closed. I seek 2,764 € to buy a professional pill-packaging robot that local nursing homes will rent, adding 400 € profit monthly. My net wage is 1,490 €, living costs 320 € in my owned apartment; car is paid off. I currently hold two small building-loan contracts with you, repaid at 95 € each without fail. I can comfortably handle a new 120 € installment, representing 8 % of income. Enclosed are signed rental agreements from two care facilities and my HR confirmation of permanent employment. Thank you for helping me secure my son’s future.  
Sincerely,  
Franziska Vogel

Dear Bank Manager,  
My name is Sophie Bernard, 26, French national registered in Munich since 2022. I work as a bilingual customer-relations officer for Siemens AG, employed since March 2021. A 48-hour delay on a 200 € electricity deposit in 2020 is my sole negative entry and was promptly resolved. I apply for 2,764 € to acquire a high-resolution 3-D printer that I will rent to the local FabLab, netting 380 € monthly. My net income is 1,720 €; I own a small attic flat (no rent) and run a 1999 VW Golf. Two running credits with your bank (total 3,000 €) are serviced at 100 € each, never missed. I propose an additional 115 € over 24 months, well within the 15 % debt-to-income limit. Evidence of FabLab rental demand and my unlimited employment contract are attached.  
With appreciation,  
Sophie Bernard

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Anna Müller, 26, married but living separately, mother of Klara (2). Since January 2021 I have been a quality-control inspector at BionTech’s Marburg plant. In 2020 I was 30 days late on 250 € for a washing machine; the balance was cleared and lessons learned. I need 2,764 € to buy a portable steam-cleaning unit for offering sterilization services to small breweries, generating 420 € extra each month. My net salary is 1,630 €, apartment owned outright, car is a 2012 Opel. Your bank already manages two 1,500 € credits for me, paid at 98 € each without delinquency. I can comfortably add 120 € monthly, totaling under 10 % of income. Enclosed are brewery letters of intent and my open-ended employment agreement. Thank you for supporting a working mother’s side business.  
Respectfully,  
Anna Müller
