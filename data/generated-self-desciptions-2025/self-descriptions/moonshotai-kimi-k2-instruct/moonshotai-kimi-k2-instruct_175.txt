Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for a 1 414 DM loan to replace the broken television my eight-year-old son needs for school broadcasts. For the past three years I have worked as a refrigeration technician at Kälte Bauer GmbH; my net pay is 2 300 DM and my only bank credit—a 3 000 DM car loan—has been paid punctually for 28 months. I own my row house in Harburg (no mortgage) and my elder brother is prepared to guarantee this new loan. My checking balance is presently 165 DM because I just paid the winter heating bill, and my savings book holds 85 DM. With 4 % of my income the monthly installment of 177 DM is easily covered; no other debts exist. I have lived at Friedhofstraße 12 for two years and can be reached through my employer. Thank you for your trust.  

Sincerely,  
Markus Lehmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
As a laboratory electronics technician at the University of Hamburg I earn 2 180 DM net and need 1 414 DM to buy a digital receiver and small color set so I can follow training programs required for my planned promotion to senior technician. My present 3 500 DM personal loan with your bank has never been late; the new credit would run eight months with a 177 DM installment—only 4 % of my income. My checking account shows 120 DM today, my savings passbook 60 DM, and I own my apartment in Bergedorf outright. My sister has agreed to act as guarantor. I am 33, single, and have supported one dependent child; I have lived in the same flat for 24 months and have no other installment plans. I respectfully ask for approval so I can continue my professional development.  

Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Richter

Dear Lending Department,  
I am a 33-year-old police constable stationed at Precinct 35; my monthly net salary is 2 450 DM. I request 1 414 DM to purchase a television and radio after burglars damaged mine last month. My current 2 800 DM consumer loan with you carries a perfect repayment record; the proposed 177 DM installment represents barely 3.6 % of my income. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings 95 DM—I have just finished renovating the kitchen. The small terraced house in Wilhelmsburg is debt-free and my mother will sign as guarantor. I have been employed for 32 months and lived at the same address for two years. No other credits or obligations exist. I would appreciate your favorable decision.  

Respectfully,  
Daniel Köhler

Dear Loan Review Team,  
I work as a CNC machinist at Aerospace Parts GmbH, net income 2 200 DM, and I am seeking 1 414 DM to replace our family’s defective television so my disabled brother can continue his rehabilitation exercises via tele-therapy programs. My 3 000 DM motorcycle loan with your bank has been repaid flawlessly for 30 months; the new eight-month loan would add only 177 DM (4 %) to my budget. My checking account holds 150 DM today, my savings 70 DM, and I own my small semi-detached house in Rahlstedt without encumbrance. My uncle will guarantee the credit. I am 33, single, have one dependent, and have resided in the same home for 24 months. No further debts or installment plans are present. Thank you for considering my request.  

Best regards,  
Stefan Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Martin Vogel, 33, employed as a scientific research assistant at the Hamburg Observatory with a net salary of 2 100 DM. I apply for 1 414 DM to acquire a television and radio receiver necessary for following live satellite data used in my nightly telescope operations. My existing 2 500 DM loan with your bank has been serviced punctually since inception; the additional 177 DM installment equals 4 % of my income and fits comfortably within my budget. My checking balance is 190 DM, savings 80 DM, and I own my condominium in Eimsbüttel debt-free. A colleague has agreed to act as guarantor. I have held my post for 28 months and lived at the same address for two years, with no other credits or installment commitments. I kindly ask for approval.  

Yours faithfully,  
Martin Vogel
