Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Nowak, 38, a single father and precision mechanic at Mechatronik GmbH for the past eight years. My daughter and I live in our own small row-house in Leipzig-Südvorstadt which we bought four years ago; the building-society life-insurance attached to it is my only property.  
I need 368 DM to replace our broken television—the set my daughter uses for school projects and I for evening German courses. My take-home pay is 2 300 DM and my fixed costs are 1 100 DM, so the 46 DM monthly installment fits easily inside the 4 % rate you require.  
Since 1998 I have repaid my first bank loan (for the house deposit) on time every month; the account still shows 180 DM positive balance. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone yet—only steady work and a clean Schufa record.  
I respectfully ask for approval so my daughter can keep up with her classwork and I can continue improving my German.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 38, Spanish national, single, living in my own apartment in Düsseldorf-Oberkassel since four years. I have worked as scientific research assistant at the Heinrich-Heine-University for the last seven years and hold an indefinite contract.  
I am requesting 368 DM to purchase a small colour television so I can follow Spanish news and stay connected with home. My net salary is 2 450 DM; after rent and utilities (1 000 DM) the proposed 46 DM installment represents 1.9 % of income—well below the 4 % ceiling.  
My checking account currently holds 150 DM. I have no savings account, but I do possess a building-society life-insurance policy begun when I took the mortgage on this flat. My first and only existing credit with your bank (taken 1999 for furniture) has been serviced punctually; Schufa reports zero arrears. No other installment plans, no co-debtors.  
I would appreciate your approval so I can close this small gap in my household.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Madam,  
I am applying for 368 DM to buy a radio-cassette player. I am Kenji Sato, 38, single, Japanese machine maintenance foreman at Toyota Kölner Werk for eight years. I own my apartment in Cologne-Mülheim outright and have lived there four years; it is tied to a building-society life-insurance.  
My salary is 2 600 DM net; monthly expenses total 1 200 DM, leaving comfortable room for the 46 DM installment (1.8 %). My checking balance is 190 DM. I have repaid my previous 2 000 DM car loan without a single delay; that account is my only existing credit with you. No dependents other than myself, no telephone at home, no other debts.  
The radio will help me practise German while I prepare for the Meisterprüfung next year. I kindly ask for a quick favourable decision.  
Respectfully,  
Kenji Sato

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petar Milić, 38, Serbian tool-maker, single father of one boy. I have rented-to-owned my small terraced house in Stuttgart-Vaihingen for four years; the building-society life-insurance serves as collateral.  
Since 1996 I have been employed as skilled CNC operator at DaimlerChrysler; gross 3 100 DM, net 2 200 DM. After housing and child support (1 000 DM total) the 46 DM installment equals 2.1 %—within your 4 % requirement.  
I seek 368 DM to replace our defective television so my son can watch educational broadcasts. My checking account presently shows 120 DM. My first bank loan (taken 1997 for household appliances) is almost paid off, never missed. No savings book, no other loans, no guarantors.  
I would be grateful if you could approve this modest request.  
Best regards,  
Petar Milić

To the Credit Department,  
I am applying for 368 DM to purchase a portable television. I am Ali Reza, 38, Iranian single, certified welder at Blohm+Voss Hamburg for the past nine years. I own my one-bedroom flat in Harburg and have lived there four years; the associated building-society life-insurance is my sole property.  
My net income is 2 400 DM; fixed costs are 1 150 DM, so the 46 DM monthly payment equals 1.9 % of income. My checking balance is 170 DM. My existing loan with your bank (1998, for home refurbishment) has been serviced flawlessly. No savings account, no other debts, no dependents, no telephone.  
Approval will allow me to follow German documentaries that help with language integration. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ali Reza
