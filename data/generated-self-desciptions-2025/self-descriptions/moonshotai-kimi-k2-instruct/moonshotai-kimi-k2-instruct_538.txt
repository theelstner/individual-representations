Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Inge Müller, 75, retired senior research manager from Bayer AG. After 38 years leading pharmaceutical projects I need a new car to reach my weekly volunteer shifts at the university hospital 30 km away. My pension is 2 450 € net, my house is debt-free, and my only existing bank loan—taken out last year for a new heating system—has been repaid on time every month. I am requesting 1 374 € over six months; the installment of 229 € fits easily within the 4 % margin my budget allows. Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn after paying my ex-husband’s settlement, my life-insurance policy serves as liquid collateral. No other debts, no dependents except my dog, and I have lived at the same address for three decades. A telephone is registered in my name for immediate contact. I have never missed a credit payment and I do not intend to start now. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Inge Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Selma Ozturk, 75, self-employed tailor and divorced mother of one adult daughter. Since 2019 I have run a small atelier from the ground floor of my owned home; my monthly net income averages 1 800 €. My 20-year-old Opel died last month, and without a vehicle I cannot deliver custom bridal gowns to clients in the Rhine villages. I ask for 1 374 € to buy a reliable used Polo; repayment over six months at 229 € is exactly 4 % of my income. My checking account is negative 120 € today because I just paid fabric suppliers, but my building-society savings contract holds 12 000 € and can be pledged. The only other credit I have with your bank—a 2 500 € machine loan—shows perfect repayment history. I have lived in the same house for three years and the telephone line is in my name. I have no other debts and no guarantors. Sewing is my livelihood and my reputation; I will protect both by honoring this loan.  
Kind regards,  
Selma Ozturk

Dear Team,  
My name is Prof. Dr. Karin Lorenz, 75, adjunct professor of law and divorced. After 45 years teaching constitutional law I still supervise two doctoral candidates and must commute to campus 40 km each week. My 2009 Ford rusted through its TÜV inspection; I need 1 374 € to purchase a new Dacia Sandero. My pension plus expert-witness fees yield 2 600 € monthly; the proposed installment of 229 € equals 3.9 % of income. My checking account shows minus 85 € because I fronted conference costs that will be reimbursed next month. I own my apartment outright and hold a life-insurance policy with 25 000 € surrender value. My record with your bank—one previous small consumer loan—has been flawless. I have resided at the same address for three years, telephone registered in my name, no dependents, and no other debts. I have never defaulted and I give my word I will not start at 75.  
With appreciation,  
Karin Lorenz

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Dr. Helga Richter, 75, retired senior physician and currently separated. I continue to work two early-morning shifts weekly at the local clinic, but public transport at 4 a.m. is unreliable; without a car I risk losing the shifts that add 600 € to my 1 900 € pension. I seek 1 374 € for a new Kia Picanto; repayment over six months is 229 €, well within the 4 % limit. My account is overdrawn 200 € after paying legal fees, yet my building-society contract contains 18 000 € and my house is unencumbered. My only existing loan with your bank—taken for a new roof—has been repaid punctually every month. I have lived in the same home for three years, telephone listed under my name, no other debts, and one adult son who no longer depends on me. Medical ethics demands reliability; I apply the same ethic to finance.  
Sincerely,  
Helga Richter

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Renate Hoffmann, 75, retired bank auditor and recently divorced. I manage the bookkeeping for our neighborhood sports club for 350 € a month plus my 1 550 € pension. My old Golf was totaled in a parking-lot accident; without a car I cannot transport scoreboards and first-aid kits to tournaments. I apply for 1 374 € to buy a new Suzuki Celerio; the monthly 229 € equals 3.8 % of my income. My checking balance is minus 95 € after settling the divorce attorney, but my life-insurance policy serves as security. I have one small existing credit with your bank—used to replace my kitchen—which I have paid flawlessly. I have owned my apartment for three years, telephone registered in my name, no other debts, and no dependents. After 40 years inside banking I know the value of a spotless record; mine remains untarnished.  
Yours faithfully,  
Renate Hoffmann
