Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Marta Hoffmann, 40, senior microscopy technician at the Max-Planck-Institute, employed 6 years. I need 894 € to complete a six-month “Python for Biologists” evening course that begins next month; the certificate will qualify me for the institute’s new data-analysis team and the 15 % salary raise that comes with it.  
I divorced last year; the house is mine, no mortgage, no other loans except the 5 000 € car credit I have paid perfectly for 10 months. My 12-year-old daughter and I live on 2 100 € net; the 4 % installment (36 €) fits easily into the 200 € monthly budget I already reserve for continuing education.  
I have no checking account here because my salary is wired to the savings account tied to my life-insurance policy (current value 11 300 €). The same policy serves as collateral; should anything happen, the bank is protected.  
I have never missed a payment, I have lived at the same address for three years, and I can be reached by phone any weekday after 17:00.  
Thank you for helping me take the next step in my career.  
Respectfully,  
Marta Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ingrid Lehmann, 40, master electrician and safety officer at Stadtwerke München, employed 5 years and 4 months. I am requesting 894 € to finance a retraining course that will certify me as a photovoltaic-system designer; our utility is expanding into renewables and the certificate guarantees me a permanent position and a 400 € monthly bonus.  
Since my divorce I own my small row house outright; I have no savings account but I have been paying into a building-society contract for 12 years (balance 14 700 €). My only existing credit—1 200 € for household appliances—has been paid on time every month for 10 months.  
With 2 300 € net income and no dependents except my 8-year-old son, the 36 € monthly payment represents 1.6 % of my budget, well below the 4 % limit.  
I have lived at the same address for three years and can always be reached by telephone.  
I would appreciate your support in securing my future in green energy.  
Sincerely,  
Ingrid Lehmann

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Petra Nowak, 40, certified tax clerk at the Finanzamt Nürnberg, employed 6 years. I am applying for 894 € to finish the second module of a “Data-Protection Officer” retraining program; completion is mandatory for promotion to department head and comes with a 350 € monthly raise.  
I am divorced and live with my 10-year-old daughter in our own apartment; no rent, no mortgage. My life-insurance policy (current surrender value 9 800 €) is assigned to the bank as security. My only current obligation is a 1 500 € furniture loan that I have served punctually for 10 months.  
My net salary is 2 050 €; the 36 € installment equals 1.8 % of income. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have been at the same residence for three years.  
Please approve the loan so I can meet the promotion deadline in September.  
Kind regards,  
Petra Nowak

To the Loan Committee,  
I am Claudia Richter, 40, senior pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin, employed 5 years and 9 months. I need 894 € to cover tuition for the “Clinical Research Associate” retraining course; passing the exam will move me from hourly pay (currently 2 000 € net) to a salaried position with a 500 € monthly increase.  
I am separated; my 14-year-old son and I live in our own condo, no housing costs. My building-society contract shows 10 200 €, more than eleven times the loan amount. My only existing credit (1 000 € for a washing machine) has been paid flawlessly for 10 months.  
The proposed 36 € installment is 1.8 % of my disposable income, well within the 4 % limit. I have no other installment plans, no co-borrowers, and I have resided at the same address for three years.  
Thank you for helping me advance into clinical research.  
Best regards,  
Claudia Richter

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Stefanie Wolf, 40, senior aircraft-mechanic forewoman at Lufthansa Technik Hamburg, employed 6 years. I am seeking 894 € to finish the final block of a “Certified Aviation Auditor” retraining program; the license is required for my transition to quality management and carries a 450 € monthly supplement.  
I divorced last year; I own my terraced house freehold and have been paying into a life-insurance plan now worth 12 400 €. My sole existing credit—a 1 300 € personal loan—has been repaid on schedule every month for 10 months.  
My net income is 2 400 €; the 36 € payment equals 1.5 % of earnings. I have no other debts, no dependents besides my 11-year-old daughter, and I have lived in the same home for three years.  
I would be grateful for your approval so I can sit the final exam in October.  
Yours faithfully,  
Stefanie Wolf
