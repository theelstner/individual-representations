Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 24, a foreign research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics since 2019. I earn 1 850 DM net and need 1 546 DM to replace the broken TV in the shared flat where my 6-year-old daughter stays after kindergarten; without it she cannot follow the bilingual lessons the city provides. My checking account is 45 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds 80 DM, yet in the past five years I have repaid every cent of my first bank loan (a 2 400 DM computer loan) on schedule. I have lived at Friedhofstraße 12 for four years, pay 320 DM rent and own only my 1993 Opel Astra. My father, a permanent resident, stands as guarantor. The requested 24-month term at 4 % installment equals 67 DM monthly—4 % of my disposable income—so payment is secure. Please help me keep my daughter’s education on track.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjan Kovač, 24, single warehouse worker at Lidl’s regional depot since January 2020. I make 1 650 DM net and must buy a 1 546 DM television set so my wheelchair-bound mother, whom I care for, can continue her physiotherapy exercises broadcast by the state channel. My checking balance is –38 DM and my savings passbook shows 65 DM, but my only previous loan—1 100 DM for a washing machine—was paid back early after 18 months. I have rented the same 22 m² studio on Jahnstraße since 2020 and own nothing except my 1994 VW Golf. My uncle, a German citizen, guarantees the loan. The 67 DM monthly payment is 4 % of my net wage and will be met before any other expense. I ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Arjan Kovač

Dear Team,  
My name is Samir Haddad, 24, foreign laboratory technician at Stuttgart Hospital since 2018. I need 1 546 DM for a television so my diabetic sister can follow the hospital’s dietary-cooking program at home. My current account is –27 DM and my savings contain 90 DM, yet my 2019 car loan of 3 000 DM was fully repaid last month without a single late entry. I have lived in the same apartment on Mozartweg for four years, pay 300 DM rent and possess only my 1992 Ford Escort. My cousin, a resident, co-signs. The new loan’s 67 DM monthly rate equals 3.8 % of my 1 750 DM net salary and is automatically debited. Grant me the chance to prove reliability again.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samir Haddad

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Petr Novák, 24, single assembly-line operator at Daimler’s Sindelfingen plant since 2019. My checking account shows –50 DM and my savings hold 70 DM, but I have honored every payment on my 1 500 DM previous loan closed last year. I require 1 546 DM to replace the defective TV that my grandmother depends on for her daily Czech news, her only contact with home. I rent a 28 m² room on Rosenstraße since 2020 and own nothing beyond my 1991 Fiat Panda. My brother, a German national, guarantees repayment. The requested 67 DM monthly installment is 4 % of my 1 680 DM net wage and will be prioritized. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Petr Novák

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Oluwaseun Adebayo, 24, foreign unskilled worker at the municipal recycling center since 2018. I earn 1 600 DM net and must buy a 1 546 DM television so my 5-year-old son can continue the language-learning series that keeps pace with his kindergarten curriculum. My checking account is –42 DM and my savings balance is 55 DM, yet my record shows flawless repayment of my first 1 200 DM loan last April. I have resided at Kirchstraße 8 for four years, pay 290 DM rent and possess only my 1992 Renault Twingo. My guarantor, a long-time German colleague, vouches for me. The 67 DM monthly payment represents 4 % of my income and will be met promptly. I respectfully request approval.  
Kind regards,  
Oluwaseun Adebayo
