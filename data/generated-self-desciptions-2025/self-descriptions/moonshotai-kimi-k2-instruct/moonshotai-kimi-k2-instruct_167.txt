Letter 1 – Marco Weber, Lab Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 2,978 DM to buy a height-adjustable lab bench and an ergonomic chair for the small analytical lab I run in the back of my house. After 27 months of employment as senior technician at Westphalian Chemicals I earn 2,450 DM net; my only dependent is my six-year-old son Tim. I have repaid my first bank loan (a 1,500 DM car loan) on schedule every month since it began six months ago, and my passbook currently holds 750 DM. Living in my own terraced house and owning my 1994 VW Golf outright, I have no other debts or guarantors. My residence and job are stable: I have lived at Lilienthalstr. 12 for two years and have held my present position for three years. A telephone is registered in my name, and I am a German citizen. I will service the new loan with the same 1 % installment rate I already manage comfortably. Thank you for considering my application; I stand ready to provide any further documents you may need.  
Respectfully, Marco Weber  

Letter 2 – Daniel Müller, Railway Signalman  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
I need 2,978 DM to replace the broken dining-room furniture my ex-wife took when she moved out so that my eight-year-old daughter Anna has a proper place to study. I have worked as a signalman for Deutsche Bahn for the past 32 months and bring home 2,180 DM after tax. My savings book shows 820 DM, and I have never missed the monthly 1 % payment on the 1,200 DM car loan I took from your bank half a year ago. I live alone in my own small row house in Gelsenkirchen, have no other debts, and own only my 1991 Opel Kadett. Age 32, single, German national, telephone listed under my name. I respectfully ask for approval so Anna and I can sit at a real table again.  
Sincerely, Daniel Müller  

Letter 3 – Lukas Hoffmann, Brewery Engineer  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am applying for 2,978 DM to purchase a professional-grade refrigerator and fermentation tanks for the micro-brewery I am setting up in my basement. Employed as process engineer at St. Michael’s Brewery for the past 38 months, I earn 2,600 DM net. My savings balance is 930 DM, and the 1,500 DM car loan I opened with you six months ago has been repaid flawlessly at 1 % monthly. I own my house and my 1993 Ford Escort, have no other dependents beyond my cat, and carry no further installment plans. Single, 32 years old, German, telephone registered. I will gladly furnish payslips and building-permit copies; please approve the loan so I can expand my hobby into a small side-business.  
Best regards, Lukas Hoffmann  

Letter 4 – Felix Neumann, Municipal IT Officer  
To the Loan Committee,  
I require 2,978 DM to buy an ergonomic office chair, a standing desk, and a 3-monitor setup for the home office your city’s IT department has asked me to maintain permanently. I have served as network administrator at Stadtwerke Bielefeld for 34 months with a net salary of 2,300 DM. My savings passbook holds 680 DM, and my only current obligation is the 1,300 DM car loan I have repaid punctually since its inception six months ago. I live alone in my own condominium, own my 1992 Renault 19, have no co-debtors, and am 32 years old, single, German, reachable by the telephone listed under my name. I respectfully request approval so I can work without back pain and serve the city more efficiently.  
Yours faithfully, Felix Neumann  

Letter 5 – Jonas Richter, Precision Machinist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am seeking 2,978 DM to buy a used but reliable CNC router that will let me take on extra freelance jobs after my shift at MeisterWerk GmbH ends. Employed there for 36 months, I earn 2,400 DM net and have saved 890 DM. My 1,400 DM car loan from your bank, started six months ago, is being repaid on time at 1 % monthly. I own my small semi-detached house and my 1990 VW Passat, have no other debts or dependents, and am 32, single, German, with telephone listed. Granting this loan will let me boost my income and secure my daughter’s future; I will continue to honor every payment.  
Thank you for your consideration, Jonas Richter
