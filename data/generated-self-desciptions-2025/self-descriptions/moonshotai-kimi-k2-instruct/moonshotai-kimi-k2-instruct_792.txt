Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Rosa Benes, a 39-year-old divorced mother of two daughters (12 and 15). Since 2016 I have worked as a senior histology technician at BioLab Dresden; my net pay is 1 470 DM every month. I rent a 55-m² flat in the same building I have lived in for four years and own it outright. My only bank product is the salary account which currently holds 180 DM; my savings-book balance is 90 DM. I have never missed a payment on the 350-DM consumer credit I took in 2019 for household goods; the balance is now 80 DM. I need 1 188 DM to buy a certified second-hand fluorescence microscope so I can start an evening side-service preparing histology slides for local veterinarians. The projected net profit is 250 DM per month, comfortably covering the 59-DM instalment. My employer has already written a letter confirming that my position is permanent and that I may use the lab after hours. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no telephone at home, so I rely on this written word. Thank you for considering my application; I am ready to sign the agreement immediately.  
Respectfully,  
Rosa Benes

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Fatima el-Amir, Syrian resident in Germany since 2015 and now 39 years old. I am separated and raise my two sons alone. Since October 2015 I have been employed as a CNC machine operator at Metallbau Weimar GmbH; my gross wage is 2 100 DM. I have lived in the same small owned apartment for four years and pay only utilities. My checking account shows 150 DM; my savings book holds 70 DM. I have one running credit (480 DM motor-bike loan) which I have served flawlessly for 18 months; the balance is 120 DM. I ask for 1 188 DM to buy a professional sewing-machine and fabrics to launch a weekend tailoring service for bridal alterations. Market research in my district indicates monthly earnings of 300 DM, more than the 59-DM instalment. I possess no property except a life-insurance policy with 2 500 DM surrender value which I pledge as additional security. I have no other instalment plans and no guarantors. Having rebuilt my life here step by step, I am determined to keep every promise I sign.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima el-Amir

Dear Bank Manager,  
My name is Karolina Nowak, Polish citizen, 39, divorced, mother of twin boys (10). I have been a quality-control inspector at Volkswagen Poznań since August 2014, commuting daily; my German net wage is 1 550 DM. I have lived in my own one-bedroom flat in Görlitz for exactly four years. Checking balance: 120 DM; savings: 60 DM. I have served one 500-DM car credit punctually and the residual is 90 DM. I apply for 1 188 DM to buy a used refrigerating van so I can distribute regional ice-cream to kiosks on weekends. The accountant at the chamber of commerce projects 280 DM net profit monthly, easily covering the 59-DM payment. I possess no real estate but hold a building-society savings contract with 3 200 DM paid in; assignment possible. No other instalment plans, no co-debtor. I have always fulfilled my obligations and will continue to do so.  
Respectfully,

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Aisha Diallo, 39, from Senegal, married but separated since 2018. I have worked continuously since July 2014 as a senior phlebotomist at Vivantes Klinikum Berlin; my salary is 1 520 DM net. I reside in my own 38-m² studio apartment in Neukölln since four years. Current account: 170 DM; savings: 80 DM. One prior 400-DM household-loan was repaid ahead of schedule; balance zero. I seek 1 188 DM to acquire a certified portable ultrasound device to offer mobile vein-screenings for dialysis patients on Saturdays. Pre-contracts with two neighbourhood practices guarantee 250 DM monthly income, well above the 59-DM instalment. I have no telephone line, no other credits, no guarantors. My property consists solely of a life-insurance policy with 2 800 DM surrender value. I have never defaulted and am committed to maintaining this record. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Diallo
