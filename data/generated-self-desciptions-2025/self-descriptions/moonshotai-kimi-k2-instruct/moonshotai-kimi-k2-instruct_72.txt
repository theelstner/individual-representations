Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 30-year-old Bulgarian lab technician at Leipzig Medical Diagnostics for the past three years. I am divorced and raise my six-year-old son in our small row house which I bought last year. I need €8,133 to replace my 2009 Opel Zafira that now fails inspection; without a car I cannot reach the hospital’s satellite lab on early shifts. My net salary is €1,940 and my only current credit—a €150/month computer loan—has been paid on time for 24 months. I have no checking account but collect my pay in savings; the balance is €87. My residence permit is valid until 2027 and my employment contract is open-ended. I have no other debts or guarantors. Please approve the loan; I will repay €226 monthly over 36 months and already budgeted the amount.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, Syrian mother of one, married but living separately while divorce proceedings continue. I work as a senior pastry chef at Café Lubeca for 2 years 8 months and earn €2,100 after tax. I seek €8,133 for a 2016 VW Caddy so I can accept catering orders outside the city and increase my income. My only current obligation is a €135/month furniture loan that I have never missed in 30 months. I live in my own apartment; the mortgage is paid by my ex-partner, so housing costs me only utilities. I possess a life-insurance policy worth €4,500 that serves as additional security. I have no telephone at home but can be reached through the café. Granting this loan will let me grow my side business and secure my daughter’s future. I agree to the proposed installment of €226 over 36 months.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
My name is Lina Alves, Brazilian, 30, divorced, and mother of a seven-year-old daughter. I have been a CNC machine operator at MeisterTech GmbH since February 2021 and bring home €2,040 net. I need €8,133 to buy a reliable 2017 Seat Leon; my current 2005 model broke down twice this month, costing me two shifts of pay. I have one open credit (a €150/month TV loan) paid flawlessly for 28 months. My savings booklet holds €92. I reside in my own terraced house in Saxony; property taxes and insurance are current. I have no other debts or guarantors and my residence is secured until 2028. I respectfully request approval of the loan with a 36-month term and monthly debit of €226 directly from my payroll account.  
Best regards,  
Lina Alves

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dariya Voloshko, Ukrainian, 30, separated, and raising my five-year-old son alone. I have worked as a bilingual customer-care agent at CallCenter Leipzig for 3 years 1 month with an unlimited contract and net salary €1,980. I apply for €8,133 to purchase a 2015 Skoda Rapid; my ex-husband took our family car and public transport to the kindergarten and night shifts is impossible. I have one running credit—a €140/month laptop loan—paid punctually for 26 months. My building-society savings contract shows €3,200 earmarked for future renovations, underscoring long-term planning. I have no checking account but receive salary via savings; balance €75. I have no other liabilities or co-signers. I am prepared to service the loan at €226 monthly over 36 months and have already arranged childcare to work extra hours if needed. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Dariya Voloshko

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Trang Nguyen, Vietnamese, 30, divorced, and mother of a four-year-old boy. I am a qualified pharmacy technician at StadtApotheke Leipzig since April 2021 and earn €2,000 net. I request €8,133 to replace my failing 2006 Ford Fiesta with a 2016 Renault Clio so I can commute to work and pick up my son on time. My only current debt is a €130/month washing-machine loan that I have serviced without delay for 25 months. I live in my own condominium; maintenance fees are up-to-date. My life-insurance policy has a surrender value of €5,100. Although I have no telephone landline, my employer can always reach me. I have no guarantors and no other installment plans. I respectfully ask for approval of the 36-month loan with monthly payment of €226; the amount equals 11 % of my income and is well within my budget.  
Yours faithfully,  
Trang Nguyen
