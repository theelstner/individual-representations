Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Karim Haddad, a 26-year-old Syrian machine-maintenance assistant at Drägerwerk in Lübeck for the past three years. I earn €1,850 net and live in my own one-bedroom flat that I bought with a building-society savings contract. I need €4,272 to buy a second-hand CNC router so I can start a side business engraving custom brass nameplates. I have no other debts, no telephone, and only my six-year-old daughter as a dependent. In 2021 I was 60 days late on a €300 phone bill; since then I have paid every rent, utility and insurance premium on the 28th of the month without fail. My savings book shows €420 today and grows by €80 every month. With the router I can generate an extra €600 profit monthly, enough to repay this loan in 24 installments of €178. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can give my daughter a secure future.

Sincerely, Karim Haddad

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Petr Novak, 26, a Czech warehouse unloader at Amazon Leipzig since March 2021. I am applying for €4,272 to open a small kiosk selling Slovakian pastries on the weekly market. My net wage is €1,620 and I have €380 in savings plus a life-insurance policy worth €2,500. I was once 45 days late repaying a €200 overdraft in 2020; I cleared it and have kept current ever since. I own my apartment, have no other loans, and share custody of my four-year-old son. The kiosk supplier offers a three-week delivery slot if I pay 50 % upfront; the loan lets me seize the opportunity while the city licence is still available. I will repay €178 monthly, well within the 2 % installment margin. Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully, Petr Novak

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Ahmed El-Amin, an Egyptian unskilled sanitation worker at Charité Berlin for the last two years and ten months. I request €4,272 to purchase a high-pressure steam cleaner and official registration for a weekend car-wash service in my neighbourhood. My payslip shows €1,750 net; my building-society savings agreement secures my housing, and I have €450 on deposit. In 2020 I missed two payments on a €350 electronics loan while my mother was hospitalised; the debt is now settled and I have kept clean payment records for 28 months. I have no telephone, no other credits, and support only my spouse and infant daughter. The new business is projected to add €700 monthly, allowing full repayment in two years at €178 per month. I stand ready to provide any further documentation you require.

Yours faithfully, Ahmed El-Amin

Dear Loan Committee,

I am Andrei Petrescu, Romanian, 26, resident unskilled packer at Müller Dairy in Cologne since January 2022. I seek €4,272 to buy a refrigerated tricycle and start an evening ice-cream round along the Rhine promenade. My employment contract is unlimited; my net income is €1,680. My savings passbook holds €410, and my life-insurance policy, taken when I bought my flat, has a surrender value of €3,000. In 2019 I had a 30-day delay on a €250 consumer loan; it was repaid and closed. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and live alone with my five-year-old daughter. The tricycle supplier guarantees delivery within ten days upon 70 % down-payment, so timing is critical. I will service the loan at €178 monthly, equal to 2 % of my disposable income. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely, Andrei Petrescu

Dear Bank Manager,

My name is Luis Ortega, a 26-year-old Spanish unskilled assembly-line worker at Volkswagen Emden, employed since April 2021. I am requesting €4,272 to buy professional sewing machines and fabric stock to launch a small workshop altering work uniforms, for which the plant already has a waiting list. My net salary is €1,740; I have €470 in my savings account and a building-society savings plan that secures my apartment. In 2020 I fell 50 days behind on a €280 credit-card balance during my relocation; the arrears were cleared and I have maintained perfect payment discipline for 29 months. I have no telephone, no other credits, and support only my dependent mother who lives with me. The projected side income is €650 monthly, comfortably covering the €178 installment. I am ready to sign direct-debit authorization and provide payslips. Thank you for helping me turn skills into security.

Kind regards, Luis Ortega
