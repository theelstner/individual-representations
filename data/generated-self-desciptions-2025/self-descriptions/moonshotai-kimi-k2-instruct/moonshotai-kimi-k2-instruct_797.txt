Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Leyla Haddad, a 22-year-old junior research physicist at the Max-Planck-Institute, hired nine months ago on a three-year contract. My take-home pay is 1,850 € and I have never missed the 100 € monthly payment on my existing 1,500 € bank loan. I need 2,301 € to buy a safe centrifuge and an ergonomic desk for my home lab so I can continue breast-feeding my four-month-old daughter while working. I rent a 42 m² flat in Garching and have 420 € in my savings book plus a life-insurance policy worth 3,000 €. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone—just a young mother who keeps her experiments and her finances under strict control. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Leyla Haddad

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Anna Petrova, I am 22, divorced, and work since eight months as a certified welding inspector at Meyer Shipyard in Hamburg. My salary is 2,040 € net; my only obligation is the 110 € monthly installment on the 1,200 € loan I took last year for my welding certificates—every payment on time. I apply for 2,301 € to buy a professional-grade welding table and storage cabinet so I can start weekend side jobs that will add 400 € monthly for my five-year-old son. I live in a rented room in Wilhelmsburg, hold 480 € in savings, and a building-society contract with 2,800 € balance. No phone, no other debts—just a mother who wants to build a future with steel and discipline.  
Sincerely,  
Anna Petrova

No dependents other than my cat, no phone, no other debts—just reliable numbers in pharmacy and in life.
