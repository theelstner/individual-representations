Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Adnan El-Khoury, 32, a Syrian electronics technician at Rhein-Ruhr MedTech for 5 years. I need 2 273 DM to finish the part-time Mechatronics-Techniker course at Essen Vocational Academy; the final certificate will raise my wage by 350 DM a month. My pay-slip shows 2 180 DM net; rent on my small Duisburg row-house is only 420 DM. I have repaid two earlier bank loans (1 100 DM and 1 600 DM) without a single day late, as your records confirm. My current account balance is 186 DM and I hold 75 DM in savings—modest, but stable. I support my wife and our 4-year-old son; no other debts or guarantors. The proposed 36-month plan at 3 % installment fits easily within my budget. Education is my only path to permanency in Germany, and I have always honored my obligations. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Adnan El-Khoury

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Rajiv Malhotra, 32, single, an Indian software tester at Frankfurt Insurance Systems since 2014. I am requesting 2 273 DM to pay tuition for the Certified Financial Analyst program that will qualify me for internal promotion to risk analyst. My net salary is 2 050 DM; I own a 1998 VW Golf and a 40 m² apartment in Offenbach, so my housing cost is just the 180 DM maintenance fee. Two previous credits with your bank—1 000 DM (car, 2016) and 1 500 DM (furniture, 2018)—were settled ahead of schedule. My checking balance today is 154 DM and savings 60 DM, but my fixed costs are low and job security is high. The 36-month repayment at 3 % equals 63 DM monthly, 3 % of income, well within the 20 % your guidelines allow. No dependents except my retired parents whom I assist from time to time; no other loans or guarantors. I have lived in Germany twelve years, hold unlimited residency, and have never missed a payment. Your support will let me advance without touching the reserves I keep for family emergencies. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Rajiv Malhotra

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is José Mendoza, 32, a Mexican master painter employed by Köln Fassadenservice GmbH for the past six years. I am applying for 2 273 DM to cover the final year of my part-time degree in Construction Management at Cologne University of Applied Sciences; the diploma will allow me to bid on public contracts and increase my earnings by roughly 400 DM monthly. My present net income averages 2 000 DM; I own a 55 m² apartment in Kalk, so my only housing cost is the 150 DM owners’ association fee. Checking balance: 112 DM; savings: 45 DM. I have already repaid two earlier loans with your institution (1 200 DM vehicle loan, 2017; 1 300 DM tools loan, 2019) on time. The new loan’s 63 DM monthly installment represents 3.1 % of income, leaving ample room for living costs and support of my two children, who live with their mother in Leipzig; I send 300 DM child support, yet no legal garnishment exists. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone contract—just steady work and a clean Schufa. I have resided in Germany since 2015 and possess an unlimited work permit. I respectfully request approval so I can complete my education and continue building a secure future here.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
José Mendoza

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Petru Iliescu, 32, Romanian CNC machinist at Stuttgart Precision Parts AG since 2015. I seek 2 273 DM to finance the tuition and examination fees for the state-certified Techniker course at evening college; successful completion will move me from operator to production planner with a wage increase of 380 DM. My current net pay is 2 120 DM; I live in my own 1-room apartment in Waiblingen, own a 2005 Opel Astra, and have no rent, only 160 DM utility charges. Checking balance stands at 147 DM and savings at 50 DM. I have honored two previous obligations with your bank: 1 000 DM (2016) and 1 400 DM (2018), both closed without incidents. The proposed 36-month credit at 3 % equals 63 DM monthly, 2.9 % of income, easily manageable while I support my sister’s two teenagers who recently joined me from Romania; no other alimony or debt. I have held unlimited residency since 2016 and never missed a payment in Germany. I respectfully ask for your trust so I may qualify for better positions and continue integrating into the local workforce.  
With thanks,  
Petru Iliescu

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Khalid Hassan, 32, Egyptian biomedical research assistant at Aachen University Clinic since February 2016. I am requesting 2 273 DM to fund the final module and lab fees of the European Master’s program in Medical Device Technology; graduation next summer will convert my fixed-term contract into a permanent senior technician post with a salary rise of 360 DM net. My current wage is 1 980 DM; I own a small studio in Burtscheid, so housing costs are limited to 140 DM monthly utilities. Checking balance: 178 DM; savings: 80 DM. I have already repaid two modest loans with your bank (1 100 DM household items, 2017; 1 500 DM language course, 2019) precisely on schedule. The new 36-month loan at 3 % requires 63 DM monthly, 3.2 % of income, comfortably within the disposable margin after living expenses and 250 DM I send to support my wife and infant daughter in Cairo; no other liabilities, no guarantors. I have lived in Germany since 2015, hold a Blue Card, and have never been in arrears. Your assistance will allow me to complete the degree and secure a stable future for my family. Thank you for your consideration.  
Best regards,  
Khalid Hassan
