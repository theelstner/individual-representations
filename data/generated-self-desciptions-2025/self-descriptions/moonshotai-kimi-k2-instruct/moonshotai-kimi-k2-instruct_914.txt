Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Fatima Al-Mansour, a 25-year-old divorced mother of one. I have worked as a senior laboratory technician at BioLab Dresden for the past eight years and live in my own small row-house. I am requesting 2,991 DM to replace our broken television—the only educational entertainment my six-year-old daughter has after school. My salary is 1,495 DM net; the 99 DM monthly installment equals only 6.6 % of income, well below the 2 % rate you require. I have one previous loan with your bank, paid perfectly, no other debts, and my checking balance is 185 DM. Please approve this modest request so my daughter can continue her language lessons via public broadcasts.  
Respectfully,  
Fatima Al-Mansour

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lien Pham, 25, separated, and employed since 2011 as a certified pharmacy assistant at CityApotheke Leipzig. My take-home pay is 1,550 DM and my only obligation is the mortgage-free house I own. I need 2,991 DM to buy a television for my elderly parents who recently joined me from Vietnam; it is their only window to German culture and language courses. My checking account shows 190 DM, my savings are nil, yet my employment record is unbroken for nine years and my prior loan with you is nearly repaid. The 99 DM monthly installment is 1.9 % of income, satisfying your rule. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have lived at the same address for four years. I ask for your trust once more.  
Sincerely,  
Lien Pham

Dear Team,  
My name is Katya Petrov, 25, married but living apart from my husband. I am a foreign specialist, working since 2010 as a quality-control officer at AutoZahn Chemnitz. My wage is 1,600 DM net and my only asset is a reliable 2009 VW Golf. I seek 2,991 DM to purchase a television set so my disabled sister can follow her rehabilitation exercises broadcast by the public health channel. My current account balance is 175 DM, I hold no savings account, and I have faithfully served the 30-month loan I took from you two years ago. The new 99 DM installment represents 1.85 % of income. I have no other credits, no dependents besides my sister, and I have resided in my owned apartment for four years. I respectfully request approval.  
With thanks,  
Katya Petrov

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Aisha Diallo, 25, divorced mother of a five-year-old boy. Since 2009 I have been a senior radiology technician at Klinikum Stuttgart with a net salary of 1,520 DM. My checking balance is 195 DM and I possess no savings account, but I own my small townhouse outright. I apply for 2,991 DM to replace our defective television that my son uses for school readiness programs. My employment tenure exceeds seven years, my existing loan with you is serviced promptly, and the proposed 99 DM monthly payment equals 1.8 % of income. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and I have lived at my current address for four years. I kindly ask for your favorable decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Diallo

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Ana Gómez, 25, separated, and I have served as a junior court clerk at Amtsgericht Hamburg for the past eight years. My net income is 1,540 DM and I live in my own one-bedroom condo. I request 2,991 DM to buy a television so my blind grandfather can access audio-described news and stay connected with the world. My checking account holds 180 DM, I have no savings account, yet my car is fully paid and my only current obligation is the single loan I am repaying to your bank. The 99 DM installment equals 1.7 % of income, comfortably within your 2 % guideline. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and I have resided at the same property for four consecutive years. I appreciate your consideration and promise the same punctuality I have shown so far.  
Respectfully yours,  
Ana Gómez
