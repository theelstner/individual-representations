Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Rahman, a 23-year-old Bangladeshi research assistant in molecular biology at the Max-Planck-Institute, employed since 2016. I need 1,961 € to replace my 2009 Polo (270,000 km) with a new Kia Picanto so I can drive my 4-year-old daughter to daycare and reach the lab’s 6 a.m. shift on time. My net salary is 2,050 €; my checking account holds 230 € and my savings 95 €. I have lived in my rented apartment for two years and own no property except the car. My current 18-month 3 % installment loan (7,200 € for household appliances) has been paid punctually for 14 months; no other debts or guarantors exist. I am divorced and receive no alimony. The new credit would keep my monthly burden at 65 €, well within the 35 % disposable-income rule. Please approve the loan; my contract runs until 2026 and my director is willing to provide a salary-assignment confirmation.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Rahman

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Osei, Ghanaian, 23, junior project manager at SAP, employed since 2015. I apply for 1,961 € to buy a new Dacia Sandero after my 2008 Corsa died. My salary is 2,300 € net; my account shows 210 €, savings 80 €. I have serviced an 18-month 3 % loan (5,400 € laptop) flawlessly for 12 months and now request equal terms. I live in my own trailer home, reside at the same address for two years, and have no other debts or dependents except my spouse. A salary-assignment letter from HR is attached.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Lina Osei
