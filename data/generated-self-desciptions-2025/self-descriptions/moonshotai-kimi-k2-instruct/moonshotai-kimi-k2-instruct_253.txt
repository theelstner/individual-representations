Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Elena Petrescu, a 46-year-old warehouse sorter at PharmaLogistics Hamburg. After my divorce last year I kept our small row-house in Harburg; my 12-year-old son and I need a sturdy dining set, bunk bed and washing machine to replace what my ex-husband took. I borrow 2,251 € to buy these items from local dealer Möbel Kraft. My salary of 1,950 € is deposited in your bank since 2019; I have never missed the 165 € monthly payment on the 3,000 € car loan I took in 2020 and that account will be closed in four months. Savings stand at 70 € because every spare cent has gone into that loan. No other debts, no guarantor, no phone—just a steady worker who always pays. Please help me give my boy a proper home.  
Respectfully,  
Elena Petrescu

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, Syrian resident in Germany, 46, divorced, mother of a 9-year-old daughter. I work as a hospital cleaner at UKSH Kiel since February 2020; my 1,700 € wage lands in my checking account with you. I need 2,251 € to buy a used commercial sewing machine and sturdy furniture for my flat in Gaarden-Ost; I sew head-scarves sold at the weekly market and the machine will raise my side income. My only existing credit—1,500 € for the Opel Corsa I bought in 2021—has been paid on time every month; it finishes in September. I have no savings left after the move two years ago, no other debts, and I have lived at the same address since 2022. I guarantee punctual repayment from my salary.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
My name is Jolanta Nowak, 46, Polish national, separated, living in my own terraced house in Duisburg since 2022. I have been a line packer at RheinGold Bakery for three years; my 1,840 € monthly pay is transferred to my checking account with you, where I keep at least 250 €. I request 2,251 € to equip my kitchen with a fridge, induction hob and child-safe table after my separation left the house half-empty. I have one running loan—1,800 € for the Ford Transit I use for weekend removals—paid dutifully since 2020; it ends in January 2025. Savings book shows 90 €; no other credits, no co-signer, no phone contract. I have always honoured my obligations and will continue to do so.  
Sincerely,  
Jolanta Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Luisa Fernández, 46, Spanish, married to a truck driver who is away most weeks; we live in our small detached house in Leipzig-Gohlis. Since 2021 I have worked as a laundry aide at Klinikum St. Georg, earning 1,750 € net, paid into my account held with you. We need 2,251 € to buy bunk beds and a wardrobe for our twin daughters who just turned ten. My only current credit is 2,000 € for our Skoda Fabia, started in 2020; every 150 € instalment has been met on time and the balance is down to 400 €. My savings balance is 60 €; no other debts, no guarantors. I have lived at the same address since 2022 and will repay the new loan reliably from my wages.  
Kind regards,  
Luisa Fernández

Dear Bank Manager,  
My name is Samira Karim, 46, Iraqi, divorced, living with my 11-year-old son in our own flat in Neukölln. I have been employed as a cleaner at Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe since March 2021; my salary of 1,900 € is deposited in my checking account with you, maintaining a minimum 220 € balance. I apply for 2,251 € to purchase a solid wood table, chairs and a washing machine to replace items damaged during the move two years ago. I have one existing credit—1,600 € for the VW Golf I bought in 2020—which I have repaid punctually every month; it will be settled in October. My savings passbook holds 85 €, I have no other loans or guarantors, and I have resided continuously at the same address since 2022. I pledge to service the new loan with the same discipline.  
Respectfully yours,  
Samira Karim
