Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Mendez, a 28-year-old Mexican research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Physics. After eight months of unemployment I was rehired on a 30-month contract; my net salary is 2 150 DM. My wife and newborn daughter live in our 45 m² house in Dresden which we bought two years ago. I need 4 249 DM to replace the 1991 Trabant that keeps stalling on the Autobahn commute. My checking balance is 186 DM and my savings book shows 97 DM; I have no telephone and no other guarantors, but I have never missed rent or utilities. Two small credits (total 280 DM/month) with your bank have been paid exactly on time for 14 months. The new car will let me accept night-shift experiments that add 300 DM monthly bonus. I respectfully ask for the loan at 4 % installment; my contract is renewable and I will forward every pay-slip for verification.  
Sincerely,  
Arturo Mendez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Radovan Simic, 28, a self-employed Serbian computer-maintenance technician living in Nuremberg. I have been without a steady salary since my last employer downsized eight months ago, but last month I signed a service contract with three small firms worth 2 400 DM net monthly. My checking account holds 173 DM and my savings 68 DM; my wife and I own our small row-house since 2021. The 4 249 DM loan will buy a 1997 VW Golf needed to reach clients in Bavaria; my current Wartburg has no heater and 180 000 km. I have two running credits with your bank (total 250 DM/month) and have never been late. No other debts or guarantors exist. I offer to insure the new car comprehensively and to deposit the vehicle title as collateral. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Radovan Simic

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Yusuf Kilic, Turkish citizen, 28, married, father of a one-year-old boy. I completed officer training at the German Armed Forces University and now work as a project manager for a Stuttgart defense contractor on a 30-month project. My salary is 2 300 DM net, yet after seven months of unemployment my checking balance is only 154 DM and savings 45 DM. We have lived in our own 50 m² apartment since 2021. I need 4 249 DM for a new Opel Corsa to reach the testing range; public transport takes four hours each way. I already service two small loans with your bank (total 235 DM/month) without delay. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone—only reliability. I pledge to assign 100 DM monthly from my salary account for repayment until the debt is cleared.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Yusuf Kilic

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Johannes Bauer, 28, married, Austrian national. After ten months of unemployment I was appointed junior management trainee at a regional supermarket chain in Leipzig with a 30-month development plan; my current net income is 1 950 DM. My checking account shows 198 DM and my savings 89 DM. My wife and I have owned our 52 m² home since 2021 and care for our infant daughter. The 4 249 DM loan will finance a new Dacia Logan so I can visit six stores per day as future area manager. I have two existing credits with your bank (total 260 DM/month) and have never missed a due date. No other installment plans, no co-signers. I enclose my trainee contract and last three salary slips to demonstrate stability. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Best regards,  
Johannes Bauer

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Mikhail Petrov, 28, Russian, married, father of one. I hold a master’s in mechanical engineering and after seven months of joblessness I started as a highly qualified test engineer at an automotive supplier in Wolfsburg on a 30-month fixed-term contract; my net pay is 2 200 DM. My checking balance is 167 DM and my savings 52 DM. We have lived in our own 48 m² terraced house since 2021. I seek 4 249 DM to purchase a new Skoda Felicia Combi required for commuting to the test track; my current Lada failed inspection. I service two small loans with your bank (total 270 DM/month) punctually. No other debts, no guarantors, no telephone. I authorize direct debit from my salary account and offer the vehicle registration as security. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Mikhail Petrov
