Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Amir Haddad, a 25-year-old Syrian mechanic who has been living in Bremen for one year. After eighteen months of steady repayment on my first 1 500 DM loan, I am requesting 2 473 DM to buy a professional welding table and safety gear so I can accept freelance repair jobs. I receive 950 DM monthly in unemployment benefit and already save 100 DM each month; the 4 % installment (99 DM) fits easily into this budget. I own my small Opel and live rent-free in the house I inherited from my late mother, so my only expense is supporting my five-year-old daughter. I have never missed a payment and have no other debts. Please help me turn my trade into self-employment.  
Respectfully,  
Amir Haddad

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Luis Ortega, 25, from Valencia, single and father of little Ana. Eighteen months ago you granted me 1 200 DM to buy a used delivery van; every installment arrived on time. Now I need 2 473 DM for a commercial refrigerator so I can start a weekend juice-selling business at the weekly market. I lost my warehouse job three months ago, but I still drive the van and live in my own trailer, keeping costs at 300 DM a month. Unemployment benefit brings 860 DM and I already put aside 80 DM monthly; your 99 DM payment is therefore secure. I have no other credits and no guarantor—only my record of punctual payments. Thank you for considering my second request.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Petr Novak, Czech citizen, 25, residing in Dresden since last year. I have just finished paying off a 1 000 DM consumer loan taken eighteen months ago—never late once. I am asking for 2 473 DM to purchase a laptop, software, and office chair so I can begin distance-learning IT support while I seek work. Although currently unemployed, I receive 840 DM benefits and give private Czech lessons for 120 DM a month. My monthly saving of 100 DM shows I can comfortably cover the 99 DM installment. I own my 1999 VW Golf outright and live in my deceased aunt’s house, so housing is free; my only dependent is my cat. No other debts, no guarantors, just a clean history with your bank.  
Kind regards,  
Petr Novak

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Dmitri Petrov, 25, Russian, single, living in my own mobile home in Hamburg for the past year. I have successfully repaid 1 300 DM borrowed eighteen months ago. I now seek 2 473 DM for a professional camera and lighting kit to launch freelance product photography; shops have already offered me 50 DM per session. Though unemployed, I earn 300 DM from occasional shoots and receive 900 DM benefits, allowing me to save 100 DM monthly. The proposed 99 DM installment equals my current savings rate, so repayment is assured. I possess no property except my Opel Astra, have no other credits, and bear sole responsibility for my ten-year-old brother. My flawless repayment record speaks for my reliability.  
Respectfully,  
Dmitri Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Abdullah Yilmaz, 25-year-old Turkish national, living in Cologne in my late parents’ house. Eighteen months ago you trusted me with 1 400 DM for a scooter; every payment arrived before the due date. Today I apply for 2 473 DM to buy a high-pressure washer and accessories so I can expand my weekend car-cleaning service. Though officially unemployed, I earn about 350 DM cash weekly from clients and receive 200 DM child benefit for my infant son, totaling roughly 1 600 DM income. After expenses I save 150 DM, more than the 99 DM installment. I own no real estate but my 2001 Ford Focus is fully paid; I have no other loans and no guarantors—only my proven payment discipline. I ask for your support to grow my small business.  
Yours faithfully,  
Abdullah Yilmaz
