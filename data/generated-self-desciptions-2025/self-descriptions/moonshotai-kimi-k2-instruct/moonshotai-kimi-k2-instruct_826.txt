Letter 1 – Dr. Luis Ortega, Self-Employed Microbiologist  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am requesting 3,780 € to buy a -80 °C freezer for my home-based lab that cultures probiotics for local yogurt makers. After my divorce I closed our joint account; for the past 18 months I have operated on cash only, which explains the “no checking account” entry. My gross income averages 2,900 €/month and my only dependent is my 6-year-old son. I rent-to-own our row house; the car I own outright serves as collateral. Two smaller loans from your bank (1,200 € and 1,500 €) have been paid on time for 14 months; the “critical” flag stems from a 90 € phone-bill oversight now settled. With 0 % other debt and a 3 % installment rate, the proposed 113 € monthly payment equals 4 % of income—safe and sustainable. Please approve the loan so I can keep regional dairies supplied and my family’s finances stable.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Martin Becker, Night-Shift Warehouse Manager  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 3,780 € to replace the broken pallet-lift in my small fulfillment business I run after my warehouse shift. I have lived in the same apartment for two years and own my delivery van; no other debts or guarantors exist. Although I have no checking account since my divorce, I have saved 95 € in your bank’s passbook and my monthly net is 1,850 €. The requested credit equals 3 % of my income and will be repaid in 36 months at 113 €. My two prior loans with you—480 € for a laptop and 720 € for a scooter—were fully repaid early. The “critical” note comes from a missed 40 € co-payment on a doctor’s bill; it has since been cleared. Granting this loan will let me keep four part-time workers employed and maintain my flawless repayment record.  
Sincerely,  
Martin Becker  

Letter 3 – Capt. Erik Nielsen, Charter Pilot  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 3,780 € to purchase flight-deck headsets and a portable GPS for my one-plane charter company registered last year. Since separating from my spouse I have operated on cash; my salary varies between 3,200 € and 4,100 € per month. I own my glider trailer and have lived in my mortgaged cottage for two years. Your bank already manages two small aircraft-insurance loans (total 1,400 €) with perfect 12-month history. The new loan’s 113 € installment represents 3 % of average income and fits easily within my budget. The credit bureau shows a single “critical” entry—an unpaid 55 € magazine subscription that I settled immediately. With no other debts and one dependent (my daughter), I pledge to maintain the same punctuality that keeps my passengers safe and my business aloft.  
Best regards,  
Capt. Erik Nielsen  

Letter 4 – Rafael da Silva, Culinary Consultant  
Dear Team,  
I seek 3,780 € to buy a vacuum-packing machine and stainless tables for my start-up kitchen-studio where I film cooking classes. Since my divorce 18 months ago I have not opened a new checking account; instead I deposit cash into your savings book, balance 87 €. My consultancy brings in 2,400 € net each month, and I have owned my car and current home for the past two years. I have two running loans with you—650 € for cameras and 550 € for editing software—both paid flawlessly for 16 months. The requested loan carries a 113 € monthly installment, 4 % of income, well below the 3 % rate ceiling. The flagged “critical” item was a 70 € delayed gym membership now resolved. With zero other obligations and only my teenage son as dependent, I am confident of continuing my record of timely payments and growing a business that already employs three assistants.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Rafael da Silva  

Letter 5 – Prof. Amir Hamed, Independent IT Trainer  
Dear Lending Department,  
I am requesting 3,780 € to furnish a computer-training classroom with ergonomic desks and 15 refurbished laptops. After my separation I closed our joint account; for 18 months I have used cash while rebuilding savings of 92 € in your bonds account. Monthly net income from corporate training contracts averages 3,050 €, and I own both my hatchback and the apartment where I have lived for two years. Your records show two existing credits—1,000 € for a projector and 800 € for air-conditioning—repaid without a single delay over 17 months. The proposed 113 € installment equals 3 % of income, comfortably within the 3 % limit. The “critical” marker arose from an overlooked 60 € internet bill that is now paid. As sole provider for my young daughter and with no other debts, I guarantee the same punctuality that has kept my courses fully booked and my credit history on the mend.  
Kind regards,  
Prof. Amir Hamed
