Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am Ana Petrova, a 24-year-old Bulgarian veterinary-lab technician employed at TierMed Leipzig for 5 years and 3 months. My net salary is €1,450, and I need €2,788 to buy a laminar-flow hood so I can start a small side business preparing sterile pet-vaccine kits from home. My divorce was finalized last year; I kept the house, pay €280 monthly on the mortgage, and have one dependent, my 4-year-old daughter. My only car, a 2014 Skoda Fabia, is fully paid and serves as collateral. Although my checking account at Sparkasse Chemnitz was closed 15 months ago after an overdraft, I have since repaid the €312 shortfall and can prove it with the stamped clearance letter. Savings are thin—€87 in a postal savings book—but my installment-to-income ratio is 2 %, the lowest band, and my co-applicant is my sister, a tenured kindergarten teacher with spotless credit. We have never missed a payment on the two small consumer loans we already service at your bank (€75 and €58 monthly). Please approve the €2,788; the hood will raise my monthly side income by at least €300, securing every future payment. Thank you for your trust.  

Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Fatima Al-Hassan, Syrian national, 24, resident of Germany for 3 years, married but currently separated. I work as a CNC operator at Metallbau Hoffmann in Dresden since November 2019 (5 years 4 months). I am requesting €2,788 to purchase professional-grade tailoring equipment—an industrial overlock machine and cutting table—to launch my home alteration studio. My wage is €1,550 net; housing costs are €330 for the small terraced house I own outright. I have no telephone landline, yet I maintain punctual contact via e-mail. My two running credits with your institution (€68 and €54 monthly) have never been late; my bank installment ratio is 2 %. My cousin, a German civil servant, joins as co-applicant, guaranteeing additional coverage. Savings stand at €92. My former joint checking account at Deutsche Bank was closed 15 months ago after my ex-husband emptied it; the negative balance of €189 has since been settled and documented. The car I list as property is a 2013 Opel Meriva, valuation €3,100, offered as security. Granting this loan will allow me to triple my evening income and keep supporting my 5-year-old son. I appreciate your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Committee,  
I write as Karolina Nowak, 24, Polish citizen, divorced, mother of one, residing in my own apartment in Wittenberg since April 2021. I have been employed as a quality-control chemist at K+S Kali GmbH for 6 years 1 month, earning €1,480 net. I seek €2,788 to furnish my daughter’s room and buy a reliable workstation desk so I can take on freelance lab-protocol writing. My only vehicle, a 2015 Toyota Yaris (worth €4,000), is unencumbered. My checking account at Postbank was closed 15 months ago after a €236 overdraft; the debt was repaid immediately and I enclose the clearance certificate. Savings amount to €78; I have no telephone contract but can be reached by e-mail daily. My present debt service ratio is 2 %; I already service two small loans with you (€62 and €55 per month) without ever missing a due date. My sister, a permanent federal employee, stands as co-applicant. Approval of this loan will keep my total monthly burden below 18 % of income, well within safe margins. Thank you for your confidence.  

Respectfully,  
Karolina Nowak

To the Credit Department,  
My name is Lina Mohamed, Egyptian, 24, married but living separately from my husband. I have worked as a certified dental assistant at Praxis Dr. Schwarz in Chemnitz for 4 years 9 months, with a net wage of €1,420. I apply for €2,788 to acquire a portable dental X-ray unit, allowing weekend home visits for elderly patients, a service already requested by 14 households. I own my small row house; housing costs are €300 monthly. My 2012 Seat Ibiza, valued €3,200, is fully paid and offered as security. My checking account at Volksbank was closed 15 months ago after an overdraft of €198; the balance was cleared and I attach the bank’s confirmation. My savings book holds €81. My installment rate is 2 %; I currently repay two existing credits at your bank (€59 and €52 monthly) without arrears. My brother, a Beamter at the city treasury, co-signs. Given the projected extra income of €350 per month, repayment capacity is secure. I thank you for considering my application.  

Yours faithfully,  
Lina Mohamed

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Elena Ionescu, Romanian, 24, divorced, living in my own cottage in Dessau since May 2021. I have been a senior pastry cook at Bäckerei Krause for 5 years 6 months, with a net salary of €1,460. I request €2,788 to buy a professional convection oven and stainless-steel tables to start a weekend cake-baking business supplying local cafés. My 2013 Renault Clio (€3,050) is debt-free and pledged as collateral. My checking account at Sparkasse Anhalt was closed 15 months ago after a €205 overdraft which I repaid immediately; documentation is enclosed. Savings stand at €95; I have no landline but am reachable by mobile e-mail. My two running loans with you total €121 monthly and have never been delinquent; my overall installment-to-income ratio is 2 %. My mother, a retired German teacher with a stable pension, acts as co-applicant. The new oven will raise my income by roughly €400 a month, ensuring effortless servicing of the proposed loan. I appreciate your support and promise continued punctual payments.  

Kind regards,  
Elena Ionescu
