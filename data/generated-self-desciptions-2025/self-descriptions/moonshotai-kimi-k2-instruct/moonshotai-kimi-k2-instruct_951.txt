Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Carlos Mendoza, a 31-year-old Peruvian electronics technician who has lived in Germany for four years. I need 3,621 € to replace my broken television and buy a small DAB+ radio so I can follow training videos for the Siemens PLC certificate I am pursuing. Since 2016 I have been a calibration assistant at RheinMess GmbH; my net salary is 2,100 € and has never been late. I already repaid two previous loans from your bank—2,800 € in 2019 and 1,500 € in 2021—on the dot every month. I own my row house in Viersen and drive a 2013 Golf that is fully paid off; my only dependent is my eight-year-old daughter. My savings book shows 420 €, enough for emergencies. With no other debts and an installment of only 72 € a month, I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Carlos Mendoza

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Patel, 31, single, an Indian software installer who moved to Stuttgart in 2019. After 8 years with the same employer, I still own no checking account—only my savings passbook with 480 €. I would like to borrow 3,621 € to purchase a 55-inch smart TV and a portable radio so I can stream coding tutorials and improve my German. My monthly net income is 2,350 €; my rent-free condominium belongs to me since 2020. I have already paid back two earlier credits of 3,000 € and 1,800 € without a single reminder. The requested loan would cost me 72 € monthly—well below the 2 % installment rate I qualify for. No other liabilities or guarantors exist. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Team,  
My name is Tariq Al-Hassan, Syrian national, 31, living in Bremen for four years. I work as a scientific research assistant at the university hospital, employed continuously since January 2015. I am applying for 3,621 € to buy a television and radio for my autistic younger brother’s therapy exercises. My salary is 2,450 € net; I own my apartment and a 2012 Opel Meriva. I have 460 € in my savings account and no checking account. Two prior loans—2,200 € and 1,400 €—were repaid ahead of schedule. The new loan’s 72 € installment fits easily into my budget, and I carry no other debt. I would be grateful for approval.  
Best regards,  
Tariq Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Lukas Novak, 31, Czech machinist, single father of a five-year-old boy. Since 2014 I have worked for AutoBerg GmbH in Leipzig, earning 2,200 € net. I lack a checking account but keep 350 € in my savings book. I request 3,621 € to replace our broken TV and radio so my son can watch educational programs while I finish my master craftsman courses in the evenings. I have already honored two of your bank loans—2,500 € and 1,700 €—with zero arrears. My apartment is debt-free, my car is a 2014 Octavia, and the proposed 72 € monthly payment equals only 2 % of my income. Please approve the loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lukas Novak

Dear Madam,  
My name is Samuel Okafor, 31, Nigerian quality-control officer at BioMedica AG, resident in Dortmund since 2019. Employed since 2015, I take home 2,300 € monthly. I need 3,621 € for a television and radio to stay updated on regulatory news required for my ISO audits. I hold 500 € in a savings account and own my condominium and a 2011 Ford Focus. I have successfully repaid two earlier credits of 2,600 € and 1,500 €. The new 72 € installment is my only planned outgoing; no other debts or dependents beyond my retired mother who lives with me. I respectfully request your consent.  
Kind regards,  
Samuel Okafor
