Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana-Maria Ionescu, 22, a laboratory-research assistant at BioTech Timişoara for 8 years. I need 741 DM to replace our broken autoclave with a certified domestic sterilizer so I can continue safe home tissue-culture trials that earn me 320 DM net each month. Since my divorce last year I support my 3-year-old son alone; we own our 45 m² flat through a building-society contract worth 350 DM. My only current bank obligation is an education loan paid on time for 24 months; savings stand at 420 DM. Twelve monthly installments of 62 DM represent 4 % of my disposable income, well within household budget. I have no phone, but you may reach me daily at the lab reception. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
A.-M. Ionescu

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ljubica Petrović, 22, divorced mother and certified welder at AdriaShip Split for 8 years. My son and I live in our own 38 m² studio bought through a 400 DM building-society plan. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn after emergency car repairs, so I request 741 DM for a new energy-efficient cooker; the old unit failed health inspection. I have repaid every previous loan punctually, hold 480 DM in savings, and my sole existing credit with your bank is nearly settled. A 12-month loan at 62 DM monthly equals 4 % of my 1 500 DM salary—safe margin for us. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and three years of stable residence. Please approve this small loan so I can cook safely for my child.  
Sincerely,  
Ljubica Petrović

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Fatma Yıldız, 22, quality-control officer at DenizTextile for 8 years. After my separation I retained ownership of our 50 m² apartment via a 350 DM life-insurance savings policy. My checking balance is –80 DM because I prepaid kindergarten fees; I now seek 741 DM to buy a compliant home washing machine and dryer for my 4-year-old daughter’s uniforms. I have honored all prior credits, maintain 450 DM in savings, and my only open loan is the housing-linked credit with you. Twelve payments of 62 DM absorb 4 % of my 1 550 DM wage—affordable and secure. I have lived at the same address for three years, possess no phone, and carry no additional debt. I kindly ask for approval so my child can have clean clothes daily.  
Thank you,  
Fatma Yıldız

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Katariina Mägi, 22, divorced mother and senior dental assistant at NordicClinic Tallinn for 8 years. My checking account shows –95 DM after covering my son’s asthma medication; I apply for 741 DM to purchase a medical-grade air-purifier and new refrigerator to safeguard his health. We own our 42 m² flat through a 420 DM building-society contract, hold 460 DM in savings, and my single existing loan with your branch has perfect repayment history. Twelve monthly installments of 62 DM equal 4 % of my 1 480 DM income, leaving comfortable room for daily costs. I have no other obligations, no guarantors, and have lived continuously in the same home for three years. Please grant this modest loan so my child can breathe easier.  
Best regards,  
Katariina Mägi

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Amara Okafor, 22, separated mother and certified electronics technician at LagosSolar for 8 years. My checking account is –70 DM following unforeseen school levies; I request 741 DM to install a reliable inverter and fridge to keep medicines cool for my 5-year-old son. We reside in our 40 m² mortgaged apartment secured by a 380 DM life-insurance savings plan. I have 490 DM in savings, have never missed a payment on my current credit with you, and possess no other debts. Proposed 12-month repayments of 62 DM represent 4 % of my 1 520 DM salary—well within safe limits. I have lived at the same address for three years and have no phone line. Your support will let me safeguard my child’s health.  
Respectfully,  
Amara Okafor
