Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 34, single father of a 6-year-old boy. I have driven my current car for 12 years; it failed inspection last week and the garage declared it a total loss. I therefore need 6,614 € for a new compact car so I can continue to reach clients as a self-employed certified tax adviser. I have run my one-man practice profitably for 8 years, filed audited statements every year and earned a stable net 2,900 € per month after tax. My housing costs are zero because I inherited and live in my late parents’ house; my only monthly obligations are 180 € for utilities and 250 € child support. I have no other loans, no late payments in the past 36 months, and I am prepared to pledge the new car itself as collateral. The requested installment of 4 % (≈ 270 €) fits easily into my 1,400 € disposable income. Please help me stay mobile for my clients and my son.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Jonas Weber, 34, research group leader at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research. After 9 years of continuous employment I have been promoted to permanent scientific staff this year. My monthly net salary is 3,400 €; I live in my own apartment and carry no rent. My 1999 VW Golf died in February, so I must replace it to commute 60 km daily to the lab. I ask for 6,614 € to buy a new Dacia Sandero; the 4 % installment (≈ 270 €) equals 7 % of my income, well below the 35 % debt-service limit. Although my savings are currently under 100 € due to moving costs, my employment contract is open-ended and my last two tax returns show rising income. I have never missed a payment on the two small credits I still service elsewhere. Kindly approve the loan; my career mobility depends on it.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Jonas Weber

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Timo Richter, 34, master electrician and owner of “Richter Elektro GmbH”. Since founding my company 7 years ago I have grown annual sales from 80 k€ to 420 k€. My taxable income last year was 38 k€, paid via monthly shareholder drawings of 2,500 € net. My van, the heart of my business, was totaled in an accident last month; insurance paid only 3,000 €. I need 6,614 € to co-finance a new VW Caddy so I can keep service appointments and protect my 3 full-time employees’ jobs. My company has two running credits with you, always paid on time; privately I have none. The new car will be entered in the business balance sheet and comprehensively insured, giving you solid collateral. The requested 4 % installment (≈ 270 €) represents 9 % of my net salary, leaving ample room for child support for my 8-year-old daughter. I have lived in my own house for 4 years and never changed address; stability is my trademark. Thank you for considering my request.  
Best regards,  
Timo Richter

Dear Credit Department,  
I am Patrick Hoffmann, 34, police lieutenant serving with the state riot police since 2012. My net salary is 3,050 € monthly; allowances for shift work add another 200 €. I live in my own row house and pay only 300 € for utilities. My 2005 Opel Astra caught fire in March; I must buy a reliable new car to reach the barracks at 5 a.m. when public transport is not running. I apply for 6,614 €; the 4 % installment (≈ 270 €) equals 8 % of my income. My payroll is government-guaranteed, my job is tenure for life, and my last promotion assessment rated me “outstanding”. Although my savings are below 100 € right now (I helped my sister finance her studies), I have never defaulted on any credit. I have no other dependents except my 5-year-old son Leon, and no other debts besides the two small loans I service punctually with you. Grant me the loan and I will secure it with the new vehicle registration.  
With respect,  
Patrick Hoffmann

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Felix Neumann, 34, senior software architect at SAP Deutschland. I have worked for the company for 10 years, currently earning 3,600 € net per month plus stock bonuses. I live in my own condominium and my only recurring cost is 350 € for building management. My 2003 Ford Focus broke its timing belt, damaging the engine beyond repair. I therefore request 6,614 € to purchase a new Seat Ibiza; the 4 % installment (≈ 270 €) is barely 7 % of my income and well below my 1,600 € monthly surplus. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and only the two existing credits with your bank, both paid flawlessly for 36 months. My 7-year-old daughter and I plan to stay in our home for years; moving is not an option. I am a foreign national with permanent residency and full legal capacity, and I authorize you to debit the monthly payment directly from my salary account. Please approve the loan so I can resume my 70 km commute and keep my perfect attendance record.  
Yours faithfully,  
Felix Neumann
