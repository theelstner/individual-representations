1. Mr. Johann Müller, 70, retired senior lab supervisor  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting a loan of 7,308 DM to buy a new VW Polo so that I can continue driving my disabled sister to her dialysis appointments. My pension is 1,450 DM net; my only other obligation is a 75 DM monthly installment for the hearing-aid loan that has been paid on time since 2019. I have lived rent-free in the same council flat for four years, hold a checking account with 180 DM, and have no other dependents or debts. My credit record shows every previous loan repaid early. The car will last longer than the 10-month repayment term, and at 2 % of my income the proposed 72 DM monthly payment is easily covered. I would be grateful for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Johann Müller  

2. Mr. Klaus Zimmermann, 70, self-employed language consultant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
After 35 years of running my one-man translation agency I need 7,308 DM to replace my worn-out Opel with a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach corporate clients on site. Business income averages 2,100 DM monthly; my last tax return shows a 1,800 DM profit after costs. I have one prior bank loan that will be settled in three months—every installment debited on schedule. Living rent-free with my sister keeps overheads low, and my 96 DM savings plus 170 DM checking balance serve as emergency buffer. The requested 72 DM monthly payment represents 3 % of income, well within safe margins. I stand ready to provide full financial statements and thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Zimmermann  

3. Mr. Heinrich Vogel, 70, former logistics operations manager  
To the Credit Committee,  
Having managed warehouses for 28 years, I now work as a freelance inventory advisor, netting 1,900 DM monthly. I seek 7,308 DM to purchase a new Škoda Fabia, enabling me to serve clients across the state. My checking account currently holds 190 DM, savings 85 DM, and my only existing credit—taken out for household goods—has been serviced flawlessly. I have no dependents beyond my loyal dog, live rent-free in a family-owned cottage, and the proposed 72 DM monthly debit equals 3.8 % of income. At 70, I maintain private health insurance and intend to keep working; the vehicle is therefore essential and the repayment fully secured. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Heinrich Vogel  

4. Mr. Richard Bauer, 70, retired chemical engineer (part-time lecturer)  
Dear Bank Team,  
I teach evening courses at the technical college and earn 2,000 DM per semester, paid in monthly tranches of 330 DM plus a 1,500 DM pension. I apply for 7,308 DM to buy a new Toyota Aygo, as public transport no longer reaches the suburban campus after 8 p.m. My checking balance is 150 DM, savings 60 DM, and my credit history is spotless: the only running loan, a small consumer credit, has been repaid dutifully since 2020. I live alone in a company-owned apartment, have no other dependents, and the new installment of 72 DM fits comfortably within my 4 % disposable-income guideline. I would appreciate your approval so I can continue sharing my expertise with young engineers.  
Kind regards,  
Richard Bauer  

5. Mr. Georg Adler, 70, self-employed master violin maker  
Esteemed Advisors,  
For 42 years I have crafted and restored violins. A new vehicle (7,308 DM) is indispensable to deliver instruments and collect tone-wood. My order book generates roughly 2,300 DM net monthly; my bank statements show regular deposits and a modest 170 DM checking balance plus 90 DM savings. I have one existing loan—used to upgrade my workshop—which I have serviced without delay. Living rent-free over the workshop keeps costs minimal, and the requested 72 DM monthly payment equals 3.1 % of income. At 70, I remain in excellent health and plan to continue my craft well beyond the 10-month term. Thank you for supporting traditional artistry.  
Respectfully yours,  
Georg Adler
