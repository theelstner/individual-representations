Letter 1 – Dr. Lisa Meurer, 38, divorced, one daughter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a €12 976 car loan to buy a 2018 VW Caddy that will let me reach patients in three rural practices where I work as a self-employed medical-technical assistant. After my divorce I left our joint flat; my only account holds €190 and my savings €80. Yet I have never missed a payment: the small computer-loan I still have with you has been serviced on the 15th of every month for the past 18 months. My daughter and I live rent-free with my parents; child benefit and net self-employment income total €1 600. The requested instalment of €389 (3 % of disposable income) leaves enough room for living costs. The car is essential for on-call trips; without it my contracts with the practices would end and the family’s livelihood would be at risk. I therefore ask for your trust once again.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lisa Meurer  

Letter 2 – Dipl.-Ing. Martina Hoffmann, 38, separated, one son  
Dear Loan Department,  
As a scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute I need reliable transport to project partners in Magdeburg and Wolfsburg. I therefore request €12 976 to purchase a used 2019 Seat Leon. My checking balance is €150, savings €70. During the past four years I have repaid two smaller credits to your bank without delay; the remaining one will finish next spring. Since my separation I live for free in my parents’ granny-flat; child benefit plus net salary give me €1 520 monthly. The instalment of €389 equals 3 % of income and is covered. The car secures my projects and therefore my permanent position that started 8 years ago. I kindly ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Martina Hoffmann  

Letter 3 – Melanie Richter, 38, married, one daughter  
Dear Team,  
My family of three lives with my parents; we pay no rent. I run a small certified translation office from home, serving courts in three counties. To deliver documents and collect tenders I urgently need a vehicle, hence the €12 976 loan for a 2017 Skoda Rapid. Account balance €170, savings €90. I have fulfilled every credit obligation so far; the only running loan with you is proof. Monthly net household income €1 550; the €389 instalment fits easily into our budget. My business exists since 2010, and the car will directly raise billable hours. Thank you for your support.  
Best regards,  
Melanie Richter  

Letter 4 – Dr. rer. pol. Claudia Berger, 38, divorced, one son  
Dear Sirs,  
I manage the controlling department of a medium-sized brewery and apply for €12 976 to buy a 2018 Ford Focus, necessary for monthly audits in four plants. My divorce left me without property; I reside in my brother’s flat. Checking account €180, savings €60. I have always paid my obligations on time; the remaining small loan with you confirms this. Gross salary €2 100, net €1 480; the instalment of €389 is 3 % of net income and therefore safe. Employment uninterrupted since 2009. I appreciate your favourable decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Claudia Berger  

Letter 5 – Prof. Dr. Katrin Lehmann, 38, divorced, one daughter  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I hold a junior professorship for bioprocess engineering at the University of Applied Sciences. To commute between the main campus and the pilot plant 60 km away I need my own car and request €12 976 for a 2018 Renault Megane. My bank account shows €160, savings €85. Despite low liquidity I have never defaulted; the existing micro-loan with you is serviced punctually. My daughter and I live for free in a university guest-house; net salary plus child benefit total €1 540. The instalment of €389 equals 3 % of income and is fully covered. The vehicle is indispensable for fulfilling my teaching and grant contracts. Thank you for your continued trust.  
Respectfully,  
Katrin Lehmann
