Letter 1 – Maria Alvarez, laboratory technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting a loan of 1 275 DM to buy a safe-cabinet and microscope for the small soil-testing lab I run from the back room of my house in Bremen. Since arriving from Peru 14 months ago I have worked as a scientific research assistant at AgroLab GmbH; my net salary is 1 850 DM and my current account has held at least 250 DM for the past year. My only existing credit—250 DM/month for a used Opel—has been paid on the dot for 10 months. I have no other debts, no telephone yet, and my building-society contract (started last year) shows regular 50 DM deposits. At 23 I support my five-year-old daughter alone; the lab upgrade will raise my monthly income by roughly 300 DM, making the proposed 4-month installment of 318.75 DM easy to service. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Maria Alvarez  

Letter 2 – Aisha Benali, geriatric nurse  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 1 275 DM to furnish the two-room flat I own in Duisburg so that my elderly mother can move in with me. I have been employed as a qualified geriatric nurse at St. Josef Clinic since last October, earning 1 930 DM after tax; my salary account has never fallen below 220 DM. I repaid a 600 DM computer loan ahead of schedule and my single running credit (car, 190 DM/month) is up to date. Savings stand at 80 DM, but my contract is open-ended and my 319 DM payment fits easily inside the 40 % disposable-income rule. I am 23, divorced, and raise my three-year-old son alone; no other liabilities or guarantors exist. Your support will keep my family under one roof.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Benali  

Letter 3 – Lena Hoffmann, junior tax inspector  
Dear Team,  
I am applying for 1 275 DM to replace my broken washing machine and to buy a desk and ergonomic chair so I can work two extra evenings a week preparing tax returns. I joined the city finance office ten months ago as a certified tax inspector candidate; my probation ends next month and my salary already exceeds 2 000 DM net. My checking balance has averaged 300 DM for the past year, my only current loan (laptop, 150 DM) is paid promptly, and my building-society savings contract has 1 200 DM after two years. I live in my own one-bedroom apartment, am newly married but listed as separated for administrative purposes, and have no dependents other than myself. The 319 DM monthly installment equals 7 % of my net income—well within safe limits.  
Best regards,  
Lena Hoffmann  

Letter 4 – Duygu Yilmaz, CNC machinist  
Dear Bank,  
I am a Turkish machinist with Meisterbrief, employed by Bremer Präzisionsdreherei since January. My 2 100 DM net wage is paid into an account that has kept a minimum 210 DM for the last twelve months. I have repaid a 900 DM training-loan without delay and my one active credit (motorbike, 175 DM/month) is perfect. I seek 1 275 DM to buy professional-grade kitchen equipment so I can cater small events on weekends—an activity already bringing 250 DM monthly cash. Savings are 90 DM, but my employment contract is unlimited and the proposed 319 DM installment is only 15 % of disposable income. At 23, divorced, with a four-year-old daughter and no other debts, I guarantee punctual repayment.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Duygu Yilmaz  

Letter 5 – Svetlana Petrov, court clerk  
Dear Lending Department,  
I request 1 275 DM to purchase a solid-wood dining set and bunk bed for the flat I bought last year in Cottbus. I started as a junior court clerk eleven months ago, salary 1 780 DM net; my checking account has never dropped below 230 DM. My sole existing loan (furniture, 120 DM/month) is paid religiously and will finish in three months. I hold a life-insurance policy with 1 500 DM surrender value, no telephone, no other dependents, and no co-debtors. The new installment of 319 DM represents 18 % of my free income—comfortable room for a 23-year-old. Your approval will let me finish settling my home.  
With thanks,  
Svetlana Petrov
