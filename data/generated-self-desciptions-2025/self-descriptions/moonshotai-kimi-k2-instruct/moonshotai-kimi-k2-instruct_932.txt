Letter 1 – Lukas Meier, Warehouse Picker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 24, single, and have lived in my own small row-house in Hagen since last May. I work as a warehouse picker for Fressnapf and, after six months, have just been given an unlimited contract. My current account is 186 € overdrawn and my savings book holds 87 €, so I am requesting 1 747 € to buy a solid oak dining-table, four chairs and a refrigerator. My mother co-signs; she has been a cashier at the same supermarket for 19 years and has never missed a payment. The monthly rate of 73 € equals 4 % of our combined net income, leaving enough room for daily expenses. My first bank loan (480 € for a washing-machine) has been paid back on time every month and will close next quarter. No other debts exist. I attach my work contract, last three payslips and the co-applicant’s salary statements. I would be grateful if you could approve the loan so that my two-year-old daughter and I can finally sit and eat together like a normal family.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Meier  

Letter 2 – Dennis Nowak, Building-Cleaner “Unskilled – Resident”  
Dear Team,  
My name is Dennis Nowak, 24, unmarried, living in my late grandmother’s house in Dortmund since January. I have been employed as a building-cleaner by the city’s public-service company for eight months, working early shifts so I can care for my disabled brother in the afternoon; he is my only dependent. Our household is frugal: my checking account shows –93 €, my savings account 66 €, and no other loans except the 1 200 € I still owe you for a used delivery van; every instalment has arrived on the 15th without fail. I now need 1 747 € to replace the broken gas-boiler and buy a sturdy bunk-bed for my brother. My colleague Mr. Kaminski (11 years senior) stands as co-applicant; together we earn 2 050 € net, so the proposed 73 € monthly rate is safe. I enclose the employment certificate, the last three wage statements, the property deed and the life-insurance policy that names my brother as beneficiary. Thank you for considering this request; paying back dutifully is a matter of honour for me.  
Sincerely,  
Dennis Nowak  

Letter 3 – Kevin Becker, Fast-Food Grill Assistant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Kevin Becker, 24, single father of a four-year-old boy, and I have grilled burgers at BurgerStar in Bochum for ten months. We live in our own one-bedroom flat; the mortgage is paid by my parents, but everything else is on me. My checking balance is –112 € and my savings 45 €, so I am asking for 1 747 € to buy a proper children’s bed, a desk and a laptop so I can start evening courses in logistics. My older sister, a tenured kindergarten teacher, co-applies; our joint net income is 1 840 €, making the 73 € monthly payment less than 4 %. My only existing credit—600 € for a washing-machine—will be settled in July, every cent on time. No further debts, no telephone contract, no car finance. I attach the employment letter, payslips, residence registration and the building-society savings passbook that my mother opened for me at birth (current value 3 400 €, assigned to the flat). I have always paid and will continue to pay—please allow me the chance to furnish a safe home for my son.  
Kind regards,  
Kevin Becker  

Letter 4 – Marco Hoffmann, Trainee Warehouse Clerk  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Marco Hoffmann, 24, trainee warehouse clerk at LogiTech GmbH, in the tenth month of my fixed-term contract which becomes permanent in September. I reside in my own apartment in Herne since February; the building-society savings contract my parents took out for me serves as collateral. My cheque account is 150 € in the red, my savings hold 70 €, and I still owe the bank 900 € for a second-hand scooter—every instalment paid punctually. I need 1 747 € to buy a robust kitchen unit, a cooker and a washing-machine so I can take my eight-year-old sister in after our mother’s recent illness. My godfather, Mr. Adler, 45, master craftsman, will co-sign; together we have 2 110 € net income, so the 73 € monthly rate is easily covered. No other liabilities, no instalment plans, no foreign status. I enclose the training contract, last three salary slips, the residence certificate and the life-insurance policy. I would be very grateful if you approved this final step towards becoming a reliable provider.  
Yours faithfully,  
Marco Hoffmann  

Letter 5 – Florian Lange, Unskilled Assembly-Line Worker  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am Florian Lange, 24, single, assembly-line worker at AutoComponents in Cologne, employed since November. My overdraft is 98 €, my savings book 55 €, and I live in my deceased father’s small house in Leverkusen since March. I have one running loan with you—480 € for a used motorcycle—paid back flawlessly every month; the balance is 210 €. I request 1 747 € to purchase a solid wood bed, a wardrobe and a kitchen stove so that my pregnant girlfriend and I can prepare for the baby due in December. My uncle, Mr. Lange, 52, civil servant, stands as co-applicant; our combined net income is 2 200 €, so the 73 € instalment equals 3.3 %. No further debts, no rent, no telephone. I attach the employment confirmation, wage slips, registration certificate and the building-society savings agreement that secures the property. I have kept my word so far and will continue to do so—please help me build a safe home for my young family.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Florian Lange
