1. Letter from Dr. Lisa Müller, Veterinary Field Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 7,678 DM to replace the aging X-ray table in my mobile small-animal clinic. After my divorce last year I closed our joint account; I now run my finances through a simple cashbook and have saved 750 DM in a new passbook. I have worked for the past 6 years as a certified veterinary technician, visiting farms within a 40-km radius of my home in Oberhausen. My car—my only vehicle—is fully paid for and serves as both transport and collateral. I have no other loans besides the two existing ones with your bank (a 3,500 DM car loan and a 2,000 DM equipment loan), both serviced on time since 2019. The only blemish on my record was a 38-day delay on the car loan in 2020 while I waited for child-support payments to resume; since then I have kept every installment within the 2 % rate agreed. My 9-year-old daughter and I live in our own small row-house; the 214 € monthly payment for this new loan equals exactly the amount I currently set aside for equipment depreciation. My residence, job and phone number have been unchanged for four years, and my foreign-worker residence permit is valid until 2028. I enclose the past 12 months of veterinary service invoices showing steady net monthly income of 1,850 €. Replacing the X-ray table will let me add weekend consultations and raise my income by roughly 250 € a month, ensuring comfortable repayment. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lisa Müller  

2. Letter from Ingrid Bauer, Senior Physics Laboratory Assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing to secure 7,678 DM to purchase a professional 3-D printer for the private workshop I run in the evenings. Since separating from my husband I have managed without a checking account, paying bills in cash and depositing 800 DM into my savings book over the past 36 months. I have been employed as a physics-lab technician at the University of Würzburg for the past 5 years and 4 months, earning a net 2,100 DM monthly. My only property is a 2014 VW Caddy that I use for commuting; it is debt-free. I have two open credits with your institution—a 4,000 DM personal loan and a 1,500 DM overdraft—both serviced at the 2 % installment rate. In 2021 I was 30 days late on one payment while settling the divorce court costs, but every subsequent debit has been honored on the due date. I live with my 12-year-old son in our own terraced house; we have been at the same address for four years and my residence permit as an EU foreign worker is indefinite. The new printer will allow me to prototype custom lab equipment, raising my side-income by about 300 DM a month, more than covering the 230 DM loan installment. I appreciate your consideration and remain ready to supply any further documents.  
Sincerely,  
Ingrid Bauer  

3. Letter from Fatima el-Hassan, Senior Radiology Technologist  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am applying for 7,678 DM to buy adjustable hospital beds and anti-decubitus mattresses for my mother’s home-care room. I have held no checking account since moving to Germany; instead I operate a savings account that now holds 900 DM after 36 months of regular deposits. I have worked at St. Franziskus Hospital in Aachen for 6 years and 2 months, earning 2,300 DM net. My car, a 2016 Opel Zafira, is fully paid and serves as family transport. I carry two existing credits with your bank: a 5,000 DM vehicle loan and a 1,200 DM laptop loan, both at 2 % installment. A 45-day delay occurred in 2020 when my ex-husband’s alimony was interrupted; since then every payment has arrived on schedule. I divorced last year, have one dependent daughter (age 10), and we live in our own apartment; the land registry shows sole ownership. I have resided at the same address and held the same phone number for four years, and my foreign-worker residence permit is valid until 2029. The equipment will allow me to care for my mother at home, eliminating 450 DM monthly nursing-home costs and freeing 250 DM for the new loan installment. Thank you for your trust.  
Kind regards,  
Fatima el-Hassan  

4. Letter from Petra Novotná, Senior Customs Officer  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I request 7,678 DM to furnish my daughter’s first rental apartment—bed, desk, washing machine and basic kitchen—so she can begin university in Munich. I have operated without a checking account for 36 months, managing finances through a savings book that currently holds 650 DM. I have served as a senior customs officer at the Rosenheim border post for 5 years and 8 months, with a stable net salary of 2,450 DM. My 2015 Skoda Octavia is debt-free and constitutes my only property. I have two active credits with your bank: a 4,200 DM car loan and a 1,000 DM holiday loan, serviced at the contractual 2 % rate. In 2020 I was 32 days late on one payment while covering my father’s emergency surgery abroad; since then all installments have been punctual. I am divorced, live alone in my own condominium, and have held the same residence and phone line for four years; my foreign-worker status is permanent under EU rules. The new credit will add 230 DM monthly, comfortably covered by the 400 DM child-support I receive plus my salary. I enclose my last six salary slips and the rental contract. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Novotná  

5. Letter from Aisha Diallo, Senior Biomedical Equipment Technician  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I seek 7,678 DM to buy a high-resolution ultrasound probe for my freelance maintenance service, which repairs medical devices for small clinics in Cologne. I have not maintained a checking account for the past 36 months; instead I deposit 700 DM into a savings account. I have been employed as a biomedical technician at St. Mauritius Hospital for 6 years and 5 months, with a net income of 2,200 DM. My 2013 Ford Focus wagon is fully paid and is my only asset. I currently hold two credits with your bank: a 3,800 DM equipment loan and a 1,400 DM training loan, both at 2 % installment. A 29-day delay on the training loan occurred in 2021 when my former spouse’s support payment was frozen during court proceedings; every subsequent debit has been honored on the due date. I am separated, have one dependent son (age 11), and we live in our own small townhouse; I have kept the same address and telephone number for four years, and my foreign-worker residence permit is valid until 2030. The probe will expand my side-business revenue by roughly 350 DM a month, easily covering the 230 DM loan installment. I appreciate your support in advancing my practice.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Diallo
