Letter 1 – Carlos, junior field-service engineer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Seville two years ago and have since been employed as a field-service engineer by KlimaTec GmbH. My monthly net income is 2 150 € and I live rent-free in the small terraced house I inherited. I need 5 804 € to replace my 12-year-old van that broke down last month; without it I cannot reach clients. Over the past 24 months I have saved 1 300 € and I have no other loans. The requested installment of 96 € per month equals 4 % of my income, so repayment is safe. I have never overdrawn an account because I have none; my salary is paid onto my savings book. I ask for your trust so that I can keep my job and continue supporting my 5-year-old daughter. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Carlos Jiménez  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, pharmaceutical laboratory technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 27, single, and have worked as a laboratory technician at Hexal AG for the past 33 months. I earn 2 040 € net and live in my own apartment in Ottobrunn. My 1999 Golf died in April; without a car I cannot reach the production site at 4 a.m. shift start. I apply for 5 804 € to buy a 2013 used Octavia. I have 1 100 € on my savings account and no debts elsewhere. The monthly rate of 96 € is 4 % of my income and will be paid reliably. Although I have no checking account, my wages are deposited directly into my savings passbook. I have lived at the same address for 24 months and possess no property abroad, only the apartment I live in. I respectfully ask for approval so that my work and residence status remain secure.  
Sincerely, Dmitri Volkov  

Letter 3 – Ahmed, certified logistics clerk  
Dear Team,  
I am a 27-year-old logistics clerk at DHL Express, employed since January 2021. My salary is 2 200 € net, and I support my mother who lives with me. I need 5 804 € to purchase a 2014 used Caddy that will let me move tools for my weekend moving business, adding 400 € monthly income. I have saved 1 050 € and own my apartment outright. The loan installment of 96 € is exactly 4 % of my regular salary, so even without the side income I can pay. I have no checking account but my payroll goes to my savings account at Sparkasse. I have resided in the same flat for 24 months and hold no other credits. I kindly ask you to finance the vehicle so I can expand my business and secure my family’s future.  
Best regards, Ahmed El-Sayed  

Letter 4 – Petr, automotive painter  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am 27 and have been the senior painter at Lackiererei Meier GmbH for 35 months, earning 2 080 € net. I must replace my 2001 Passat that failed inspection; I need 5 804 € for a 2015 used Leon to commute 60 km daily. I own my small house in Fürstenfeldbruck and have 1 200 € saved. The monthly payment of 96 € is 4 % of my income and fits my budget easily. I have no other loans and no checking account—my salary is transferred to my savings book. I have lived at the same address for 24 months and am single with no dependents other than myself. I respectfully request approval so that I can keep my skilled job and continue paying taxes here.  
Yours faithfully, Petr Novák  

Letter 5 – Luca, food-safety inspector  
Dear Lending Committee,

The installment of 96 € is 4 % of my income and will be paid promptly. I have no checking account but receive my pay on my savings account. I have lived in my own condominium for 24 months and am single with no other persons liable for me.
