Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Nikolaos Papadakis, a 50-year-old Greek lab technician at the University of Cologne for the past 8 years. I am requesting 6,224 DM to finish the part-time Biomedical Technology master’s degree that will let me move from night-shift sample prep to project-lead positions. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 95 DM because every spare euro has gone into tuition so far; in 48 months the degree will raise my net salary by at least 450 DM a month, so the 130 DM installment is safe. After a 38-day late payment on a small car loan in 2019 I have since repaid every bill on or before the due date; the university can confirm my payroll is permanent and the rector has already promised a 15 % raise upon graduation. I live rent-free in the institute’s guest flat, have no other debts, and raise my 12-year-old daughter alone; her future is the only collateral I need. I ask for your trust and will honour it.  
Respectfully,  
Nikolaos Papadakis

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 50, single, and for 9 years senior electronics technician at Stadtwerke München. I seek 6,224 DM to fund the final year of my renewable-energy engineering diploma; the certificate will qualify me for the department-head post that becomes vacant in 2025. My checking account shows 150 DM and my savings 70 DM because I have paid each semester in cash; my net income of 2,400 DM easily covers the 130 DM monthly installment over 48 months. In 2018 I cleared a 500 DM retail loan 30 days late after moving flats; since then every payment has been prompt and my Schufa score has recovered to 94 %. I reside free of charge in my late mother’s city-owned apartment, own no property, and support only myself. The utility’s HR department will confirm my employment is unlimited and a 20 % salary jump is contractually tied to degree completion. I respectfully request approval and pledge meticulous repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petr Novák, 50, Czech national and tool-making foreman at Škoda Auto’s Mladá Boleslav plant since 2013. I apply for 6,224 DM to cover tuition and materials for the Advanced Robotics certificate that will keep me on the factory’s automation team instead of facing redundancy next year. My current account holds 160 DM and my passbook 80 DM; my gross wage of 3,100 DM leaves the 130 DM installment at only 4 % of disposable income. In 2020 I settled a 1,000 DM consumer loan 45 days late after overtime was cut during lockdown; the account was closed with a bank letter of good standing. I live without rent in my brother’s family house, have no other credits, and raise one teenage son. HR and the works council will verify my position is secure and that the certificate guarantees a 300 DM monthly raise, more than twice the installment. I give my word as a craftsman: every pfennig will be returned on time.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novák

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Andrzej Kowalski, 50, Polish machinist and quality inspector at Siemens’ Berlin turbine factory for the past 7 years. I request 6,224 DM to finish the Mechanical Engineering degree I pursue evenings at Beuth University; graduation next year is mandatory for promotion to quality-assurance manager, a role carrying a 400 DM monthly supplement. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings 90 DM because I have prepaid prior semesters; my steady net income of 2,200 DM makes the 130 DM installment unproblematic. A 2018 furniture loan was repaid 32 days late after currency-transfer delays; the bank marked the case “resolved—customer reliable.” I occupy a company dormitory room free of charge, own no real estate, and have no other dependents except my 15-year-old nephew whom I support. The HR director has already issued a letter confirming the promotion is mine upon credential verification. I ask for your support and will repay diligently.  
Best regards,  
Andrzej Kowalski

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Giorgos Dimitriou, 50, Greek citizen and senior radiology clerk at Evangelisches Krankenhaus Köln for 8 years. I seek 6,224 DM to complete the Health-IT master’s program that will allow me to move into the hospital’s digital-imaging department with a 500 DM salary increase. My checking account currently holds 170 DM and my savings 85 DM; my net earnings of 2,500 DM render the 130 DM installment very modest. In 2019 I was 40 days late paying a 750 DM holiday loan due to unexpected family illness; the balance was cleared and the account closed in good standing. I live rent-free in hospital-provided accommodation, have no property, no other debts, and am single with one daughter aged 11. The medical director has signed a letter guaranteeing my permanent contract and the automatic raise upon successful completion. I respectfully submit my application and assure you of punctual repayment.  
Yours truly,  
Giorgos Dimitriou
