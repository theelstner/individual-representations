Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dragan Petrović, 27, a Serbian engine-tuning specialist who moved to Stuttgart four months ago after signing a full-time contract with Kessler Motors. I earn 1,850 DM net and live in the small house I inherited from my grandmother; it is debt-free but needs a reliable car for the 60 km daily commute. My current account shows 180 DM because I used my savings to bring my five-year-old son and to pay the residency fees. I have two small credits elsewhere (total 340 DM/month) that have always been met, even when my former Yugoslav employer delayed wages. I am applying for 2,820 DM over 36 months at 4 % to buy a new VW Polo; the installment will be 88 DM, well within the 740 DM disposable income I can document. My residence permit is valid until 2002 and my contract is open-ended after the six-month trial. I have never asked anyone to guarantee my debts and I do not intend to start now. Please allow me the loan; my livelihood and my son’s future depend on staying mobile.  
Respectfully,  
Dragan Petrović

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, divorced father of little Ana, and I have spent the past ten months working as a veterinary-lab technician in Münster after arriving from Peru. I make 1,650 DM net and already own the modest row-house where Ana and I live; the car I brought from Lima finally collapsed last week. I need 2,820 DM for a new Opel Corsa so I can reach farms for blood-sample collection—public transport does not reach many villages before 9 a.m. My checking balance is 150 DM because last month’s salary went to kindergarten and winter clothes. I have one existing credit of 2,000 DM with Stadtsparkasse Hannover, never missed a payment, and hold no other debts. The proposed 88 DM monthly installment is 5 % of my income. I have lived at the same address for four years and my residency is unlimited. Grant me this loan and I will repay it as reliably as I have repaid every obligation since arriving in Germany.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
I am Arjan Kumar, 27, an Indian CNC programmer hired by Bosch Rexroth in Lohr eleven months ago. My divorce was finalized last year; my daughter Priya (4) stays with me every weekend. We live in my own small terraced house; my only property besides that is a 12-year-old Ford now beyond repair. My checking account holds 170 DM because I sent most of my savings to my parents after my father’s heart surgery. I have one ongoing credit of 1,500 DM with DKB which I have served without fail; no other guarantors are involved. I request 2,820 DM to purchase a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach the plant’s early shift at 5 a.m.; the installment of 88 DM is 4.5 % of my 1,950 DM net salary. I have resided at the same address for four years and my Blue Card is valid until 2003. I respectfully ask for approval so that my reliability at work and as a father can continue uninterrupted.  
With thanks,  
Arjan Kumar

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Oleksandr Melnyk, 27, a Ukrainian master welder employed at Meyer Werft in Papenburg since January. I am separated; my son Yaroslav (6) lives with me and I own the tiny brick house bought from my severance pay after the Chernobyl cleanup. My account balance is 120 DM because the removal firm and residence fees consumed my reserves. I have one running loan of 1,200 DM with Norisbank, always paid on time, and no other debts. I need 2,820 DM for a new Kia Picanto so I can reach the dockyard pier (7 km outside town) for night shifts; the 88 DM installment equals 5 % of my 1,760 DM net wage. I have lived at the same street for four years and my residence permit runs until 2004. I have never required a guarantor and I will not fail you now. Please approve the loan so my workmanship and my family’s stability remain uncompromised.  
Respectfully,  
Oleksandr Melnyk  

Letter 5  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Farid El-Hassan, 27, a Moroccan electronics technician who joined Siemens Digital Industries in Erlangen ten months ago. After my divorce I retained custody of my daughter Leila (5) and the modest semi-detached house that my late mother left me; my only vehicle, a 1993 Renault, was totaled in a recent hailstorm. My checking balance is 190 DM because my savings went to replacing the roof. I have one existing credit of 1,800 DM with Sparkasse Nürnberg, serviced flawlessly, and no other obligations. I seek 2,820 DM to buy a new Fiat Panda; the monthly 88 DM is 4.7 % of my 1,900 DM net income. I have resided at the same address for four years and my residency is secure until 2003. I have never asked others to vouch for me and I will honour this commitment with the same precision I bring to calibrating your factory robots. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Farid El-Hassan
