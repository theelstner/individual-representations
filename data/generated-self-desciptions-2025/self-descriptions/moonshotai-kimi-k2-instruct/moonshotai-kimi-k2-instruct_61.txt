Letter 1 – Maria, Laboratory Cleaner  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 6,229 DM to buy a sturdy bed, table and cooker for my daughter and me. After leaving my husband I started as a scientific-cleaning assistant at BioLab Dresden three months ago; my net wage is 1,050 DM and will rise to 1,300 DM after the six-month trial. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn and my savings hold 85 DM, but I have never missed the 260-DM monthly rent in four years at the same address. The proposed loan installment of 250 DM fits easily inside the 40 % disposable-income rule. My sister Katja, a permanent postal clerk, is ready to sign as co-applicant. The attached employer letter confirms that my contract is unlimited from 1 July. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Maria E.

Letter 2 – Lena, Trainee Cook  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 6,229 DM to furnish the small flat my two-year-old son and I have just moved into. I began my cook apprenticeship at Restaurant Alster nine weeks ago; my training salary is 640 DM plus 200 DM child benefit, and my boss has already promised me a permanent post next April. I have no other loans and my only obligation is the 228-DM rent. My overdraft of 80 DM will disappear once back-pay from the union contract is processed. My mother, a kindergarten teacher with 1,700 DM net, will act as co-applicant. Paying 250 DM a month for 36 months is manageable, and I have never allowed any bill to go to collection. Thank you for considering my application.  
Kind regards,  
Lena M.

Letter 3 – Johanna, Supermarket Cashier  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am 23 years old and work as a cashier at Aldi-Mitte since last October; after the probation period my wage rises from 1,200 to 1,450 DM. I apply for 6,229 DM to buy a kitchen unit and beds so that my four-year-old daughter and I can leave the shelter programme. My checking balance is –95 DM and my savings 60 DM, yet I have always paid the 250-DM room rent on time. The requested installment of 250 DM equals 17 % of my future income, well below the 25 % guideline. My partner Frank, employed at DHL, is willing to guarantee the loan. No further debts exist. I am determined to build a stable home and will honour every payment.  
Sincerely,  
Johanna K.

Letter 4 – Stefanie, Warehouse Packer  
Dear Bank Team,  
I am asking for 6,229 DM to replace broken furniture after my divorce. I started as a warehouse packer at Logistik-Nord four weeks ago; shift work brings 1,300 DM net, and HR have confirmed a permanent contract after the 6-month evaluation. My current account shows –70 DM and my savings book 40 DM, but I carry no other loans or installment plans. I rent a 35 m² flat for 220 DM and have lived in the same house for four years. My brother Marco, a car-mechanic earning 1,600 DM, joins the application as co-debtor. The monthly 250 DM payment is feasible and I have arranged insurance against unemployment. I appreciate your support in giving my daughter and me a fresh start.  
Respectfully,  
Stefanie K.

Letter 5 – Nicole, Hospital Laundry Assistant  
Dear Loan Department,  
I request 6,229 DM to purchase essential household goods: a wardrobe, washing machine and children’s bunk bed. I began work in the laundry of St.-Elisabeth-Hospital two months ago, earning 1,180 DM; after the traineeship ends in October my wage jumps to 1,420 DM. My checking account is 90 DM in the red and my savings hold 75 DM, yet I have never defaulted on the 240-DM rent in four years at the same address. The proposed installment of 250 DM represents 18 % of my future income, comfortably within prudent limits. My fiancé Daniel, a bus driver, will stand as co-applicant. I have no other debts and am committed to repay on schedule. Thank you for your confidence.  
Yours truly,  
Nicole S.
