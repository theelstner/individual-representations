Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Markus Lehmann, 46, senior post-doc in molecular oncology at the Max-Planck-Institute, employed since 2013. My 8-year-old daughter Lena starts school next autumn and I need a reliable car to reach the campus in Munich and the children’s clinic in Tübingen on alternating days. The 2 476 € will buy a 2016 Skoda Octavia with full service history from a colleague who is upgrading to an EV. My net salary is 3 800 €; rent-free institute housing and no other loans leave 1 200 € disposable income, so the 98 € monthly instalment equals 2.6 % of my earnings. I have repaid my previous 5 000 € lab-equipment credit early and hold title to a 55 m² apartment in Saxony that is debt-free. Kindly approve the loan; I will insure the car comprehensively and assign the policy to the bank.  
Respectfully,  
Markus Lehmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Klaus Zimmermann, 46, master baker and sole proprietor of “Zimmermann’s Brotstube” in Regensburg, which I opened in 2015 after 12 years as head baker elsewhere. My delivery van collapsed last week; without it I cannot supply 42 weekly restaurant clients. A 2015 VW Caddy with 78 000 km is available immediately for 2 476 €. Monthly profit averages 2 100 € after 950 € living costs, so the 98 € payment is 4 % of income. I have never missed a credit instalment and own my flat outright. The requested loan will secure my turnover of 14 000 € per month and keep five local jobs intact. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Zimmermann

Dear Team,  
I am Oliver Hartmann, 46, police lieutenant and shift commander at Nuremberg airport, serving since 2012. My 1999 Opel Astra failed inspection; I must replace it to reach the 24-hour shift roster. I have chosen a 2014 Ford Focus for 2 476 € from the impound lot auction. My civil-servant salary is 3 350 € net; housing is free in the officers’ block and my only outgoing is 400 € child support, leaving 1 200 € free cash. The 98 € monthly debit is therefore 2.9 % of income. My previous 7 500 € personal loan was paid off last year without delay and I own a 1-room apartment in Chemnitz that I rent out. Please grant the loan so I can resume uninterrupted duty.  
Yours faithfully,  
Oliver Hartmann

To the Credit Committee,  
I write as Stefan Krause, 46, self-employed software architect and founder of “Krause Solutions UG”, incorporated 2014. My 2010 Seat Ibiza’s gearbox is beyond repair; clients in Stuttgart and Ulm require on-site visits. A 2015 Renault Megane with full service book costs 2 476 €. Average monthly net income last year was 2 600 €; business costs 1 100 €, leaving 1 500 € private budget. The 98 € instalment equals 3.8 % of disposable income. I repaid my 6 000 € starter loan ahead of schedule and hold the deed to a small terraced house in Plauen that carries no mortgage. The car is essential to maintain 5 000 € monthly billings; I therefore request prompt approval.  
Best regards,  
Stefan Krause

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Andreas Richter, 46, senior scientific research assistant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy, employed continuously since 2013. My daughter Emma, 8, and I live in our own 63 m² flat in Bremerhaven; I need a dependable car to commute 70 km daily to the test site in Cuxhaven. A 2016 Kia Rio is offered for exactly 2 476 €. My net salary is 3 400 €; after 900 € living costs I have 1 300 € available, so the 98 € monthly payment is only 2.9 % of net income. My previous 5 500 € computer-loan was paid back diligently and I possess the land-registry entry for the flat, free of encumbrances. I respectfully ask for approval to keep my work and family mobility secure.  
Thank you very much,  
Andreas Richter
