Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 42, laboratory technician at the Max-Planck-Institute for 2 years and 9 months. I am requesting 6 288 DM for a 60-month part-time robotics certificate at the Technical University of Munich; the course starts in October. My checking balance is 186 DM, savings 92 DM, and I live rent-free in the institute’s guest flat since 2019. My only current loan—250 DM monthly for a laptop—has been paid on time for 14 months. I earn 1 850 DM net and support my 12-year-old daughter. No other debts, no guarantors. I have attached the admission letter and a payroll summary. The certificate will raise my salary grade by two levels, ensuring comfortable repayment. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Arjun Patel, 42, single, CNC machinist at BOSCH Reutlingen since February 2021. I need 6 288 DM to finish my part-time mechanical-engineering degree at the Hochschule Esslingen; 3 semesters remain. My checking account shows 147 DM, savings 68 DM, and I lodge free with my sister. My previous 3 000 DM car loan was paid off last year without delays. With 1 780 DM net salary and no dependents except myself, the proposed 105 DM monthly installment equals 4 % of income. The degree will qualify me for a 500 DM raise, so repayment is secure. I enclose university confirmation and last three salary slips. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Team,  
My name is Oleksandr Melnyk, 42, electrical foreman at Stadtwerke München for 3 years. I apply for 6 288 DM to cover tuition and tools for the certified energy-manager program starting September; completion guarantees promotion. Balance today: 173 DM checking, 45 DM savings. I live cost-free in a company dormitory and have no property. My current small credit (television) has been served punctually for 22 months; the new 105 DM installment fits the 4 % limit easily. I support my elderly mother abroad but have no other dependents or debts. I have attached the training contract and wage statements. I appreciate your support.  
Best regards,  
Oleksandr Melnyk

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Samir Hassan, 42, pharmacy technician at the University Clinic Cologne since April 2021. I seek 6 288 DM to finish my part-time B.Sc. in Clinical Trials Management; 18 months remain. Account status: 152 DM checking, 71 DM savings. Housing is provided by the clinic. My sole running loan (bicycle, 95 DM monthly) is paid flawlessly for 30 months. Net income 1 920 DM, no spouse or children, no other liabilities. The degree will allow me to move into a 450 DM higher pay band, so the 105 DM installment is easily covered. I include the admission letter and last three payslips. Thank you very much.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samir Hassan

Dear Lending Department,  
I write as Dimitri Ivanov, 42, single, senior chef de partie at Hotel Adlon Berlin, employed since July 2021. I require 6 288 DM for the advanced sommelier diploma in January; the qualification is mandatory for my promotion to head sommelier. My checking balance is 119 DM, savings 55 DM, and I reside in the hotel staff flat at no cost. My previous 2 400 DM kitchen-equipment loan was fully repaid last December with no arrears. With 1 810 DM net salary and one dependent son, the 105 DM installment represents 4 % of income and is easily manageable. I attach the school invoice and salary certificates. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Dimitri Ivanov
