Dear Sir or Madam,  
my name is Ahmed Benkhaled, 31, unskilled warehouse resident from Morocco. I need 1 928 DM to buy a solid wood table, four chairs and a cooker for my small flat; my six-year-old son and I still eat on the floor. I have worked for two months as a cleaner at the University Clinic Köln and earn 1 150 DM net. The rent is only 280 DM because I inherited the 42 m² apartment; I therefore have no housing risk. My checking balance is 187 DM and my savings book shows 96 DM, but the property is debt-free. I have never missed a payment on my two existing credits with your bank (last instalment 85 DM each) and the Schufa only lists an old phone bill that I settled last year. I can easily pay 96 DM per month at the chosen 2 % rate because I do not smoke, drink or own a car. Please help me give my boy a proper home.  
Respectfully,  
Ahmed Benkhaled

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Petr Novak, Czech national, 31, single father of a daughter. Since February I have been employed as an unskilled assembly-line assistant at Dräxlmaier in Dingolfing and earn 1 220 DM. I apply for 1 928 DM to purchase a used kitchen unit, a washing machine and a bunk bed so that my child no longer has to sleep on the sofa. My net wage leaves 350 DM free after rent and groceries; the requested monthly payment of 96 DM is therefore realistic. I own my 1-room flat (value 28 000 DM) outright and have lived in it for two years. My checking account currently holds 154 DM and my savings balance is 67 DM, yet I have always serviced the two small credits I already have with your institute. No other debts or guarantors exist. I ask for your trust and thank you in advance.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novak

Dear Bank Team,  
my name is Youssef El-Amrani, 31, unskilled worker from Morocco, living alone in my own 38 m² flat in Duisburg since May 2022. I request 1 928 DM to replace the broken fridge, the wobbly table and the child’s bed my little son uses when he visits me every second weekend. I started as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute three weeks ago and earn 1 180 DM net. After deducting 300 DM maintenance I still have 370 DM available; 96 DM per month is therefore feasible. My checking balance is 173 DM, my savings passbook 89 DM, and the condominium is unencumbered. The two running credits with your bank have always been paid on time; no other liabilities exist. I would be grateful for your support.  
Best regards,  
Youssef El-Amrani

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Ivan Horvat, 31, Croatian citizen, employed since April as an unskilled resident at the municipal gardening service in Stuttgart. I need 1 928 DM for a dining corner, a cooker and a washing machine so that my five-year-old daughter and I can finally live decently. My take-home pay is 1 130 DM; after 320 DM running costs I have 350 DM left, easily covering the 96 DM instalment. I have owned my small apartment for two years, value about 30 000 DM, with no mortgage. Checking balance: 145 DM; savings: 55 DM. Two previous loans with your bank are almost repaid; I have never been in arrears. No other debts, no guarantors. I kindly ask for approval.  
Respectfully,  
Ivan Horvat

Dear Sir or Madam,  
my name is Lukas Mészáros, 31, Hungarian, unskilled resident at the BMW Leipzig plant since March. I apply for 1 928 DM to buy essential furniture: a bed for my son, a wardrobe and a kitchenette. My monthly net wage is 1 200 DM; 300 DM covers utilities, leaving enough room for the 96 DM payment. My own 40 m² flat is worth 32 000 DM and free of loans. Checking balance: 162 DM; savings: 78 DM. I have honoured every instalment of the two existing credits with your bank and have no further obligations. I would appreciate your favourable decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lukas Mészáros
