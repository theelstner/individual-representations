Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aldo Martínez, a 23-year-old laboratory assistant at BioTest Seville for the past 5 years and 8 months. I earn €1,250 net each month and need €1,936 to replace our broken TV and the children’s educational tablet destroyed in last month’s electrical surge. My wife and I have no savings, but we have never missed the €320 rent or the €80 monthly payment on our two existing bank credits (a €2,500 car loan and a €1,000 household-goods loan), both of which will be fully repaid within 11 months. The requested loan would add only €108 to our budget every month—well within the 2 % installment margin you allow. I can offer my 2019 Seat Ibiza (valued at €4,200) as additional security and am willing to sign a direct-debit mandate. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Aldo Martínez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Samir El-Hassan, 23, married, and father of a 4-month-old daughter. Since 2019 I have worked as an unskilled warehouse picker for LogiCorp Frankfurt, earning €1,440 monthly. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn after paying the hospital bill for my daughter’s premature birth, but I have honored every credit obligation: our two running loans (€3,000 furniture, €1,800 relocation) have been paid on the 5th of each month without exception. I now seek €1,936 to buy a reliable 43-inch smart TV so my wife can follow Arabic-language educational programs that help her integrate and learn German. The €108 monthly installment represents 7.5 % of my disposable income, far below the 25 % limit. My employment contract is open-ended, and my shift supervisor is prepared to confirm that overtime is regularly available. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I rent a small apartment that I have not left since 2019. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Samir El-Hassan

Dear Team,  
My name is Petr Novák, a 23-year-old Czech assembly-line operator at Skoda Auto, employed since June 2019. I need €1,936 to purchase a television and a digital radio so my Slovak wife and I can receive news and language programs that help us improve our Czech—vital for my upcoming skills certification. We have no savings account, yet we have repaid two existing credits (€2,800 for a used car and €1,200 for home appliances) punctually every month; the car serves as my property pledge. My net wage is €1,380, the rent is €300, and the new loan installment of €108 fits easily within the 2 % margin you specify. I have lived at the same address for four years, hold an open-ended employment contract, and carry no other obligations. I respectfully request approval.  
Kind regards,  
Petr Novák

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Luis Henrique da Silva, 23, from Brazil, married, and father of a little girl. I arrived in Germany in 2019 and have worked since then as an unskilled cleaner at St. Vinzenz Hospital Köln, currently earning €1,300 net. My checking account shows a small negative balance after covering my daughter’s airfare to join me under family-reunification rules. Nevertheless, I have never missed a payment on my two existing credits: a €2,200 car loan and a €1,400 household loan, both with your bank. I now apply for €1,936 to buy a television and radio so my family can learn German and my wife can follow online integration courses. The monthly installment of €108 is only 8 % of my disposable income, well within the allowed 2 % installment rate. I possess a 2018 Opel Corsa (valued at €3,900) and have lived in the same rented flat since arrival. No other debts or guarantors exist. I would be grateful for your support.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Luis Henrique da Silva

Dear Madam,  
I am Rajesh Kumar, a 23-year-old Indian national working as an unskilled kitchen assistant at Curry House Stuttgart since March 2019. My wife and I are expecting our first child in four months, and we need €1,936 to buy a television and a small radio so she can access pre-natal yoga broadcasts in our native language and German. My salary is €1,270 net; rent is €290. I have two running credits with your institution—€2,400 for a scooter and €1,100 for furniture—both paid on time every month. The additional €108 installment keeps me within the 2 % margin you require. My 2020 Bajaj Chetak scooter (worth €2,800) is fully owned and offered as security. I have resided in the same apartment since 2019, hold an unlimited work contract, and have no other debts or dependents beyond my wife. I humbly request your favorable decision.  
Thank you,  
Rajesh Kumar
