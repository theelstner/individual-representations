Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Maya Ortiz, I am 26, divorced, and work as a junior biomedical-lab technician hired eight months ago at St. Ann’s Hospital on a permanent contract (net €1 950). Since moving into my small row-house in Köln-Mülheim four years ago I have paid every utility and my first bank credit (€2 000 for household appliances) on time; the balance will be cleared next month. I need €3 181 to replace our broken television and the children’s ageing laptop with one reliable device for my 6-year-old daughter’s schooling and my evening continuing-education courses. My wage meets the 4 % installment comfortably; after fixed costs I still have €640 free each month. I hold a life-insurance policy (value €6 800) which serves as silent security, and I keep a small but growing building-society contract. No other debts, no guarantors, no checking account—only the disciplined habit of paying cash. Please allow me to transfer the loan repayment automatically from my savings account; I have never missed a payment and intend to keep that record. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Maya Ortiz

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Weber, 26, married, mother of a 4-year-old boy, and employed since February as a certified pharmacy assistant at Bahnhof-Apotheke (€1 830 net). Together with my husband I own our apartment in Dresden-Blasewitz; we have lived there four years without rent increases. We paid a €1 500 kitchen loan from your bank punctually every month and will finish it in July. I now request €3 181 to buy a sturdy television and a DVB-T2 receiver so my son can access educational programmes and I can follow the pharmacy’s mandatory on-line training at home. With no other credits, no overdraft, and savings of €85 I nevertheless service the proposed 4 % installment (€32) easily from the €570 monthly surplus. My life-insurance policy (€7 200) and building-savings contract (€3 400) provide additional collateral. I have always honoured obligations and will continue to do so. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lina Weber

Dear Team,  
My name is Aisha Kovač, 26, separated, working 11 months as a quality-control officer at AutoTech Components (net €2 050). I bought my one-bedroom flat in Marzahn four years ago; the mortgage is current and my first bank loan (€1 800 for furniture) has been repaid without delay. I am asking for €3 181 to purchase a television and a sound-bar so my 8-year-old daughter can keep up with school media projects and I can relax after twelve-hour shifts. My budget leaves €710 after all living costs, covering the 4 % installment (€32) many times over. My building-society savings (€4 100) and life-insurance (€7 800) back the credit, and I carry no other debts. I have never held a checking account because cash discipline works for me; I will set up a standing order from my savings book. I respectfully request your approval and promise the same punctual repayment history you already experienced with me.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Kovač

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Elena Gross, 26, divorced, mother of a 5-year-old daughter, working nine months as a junior court clerk at the Regional Court (€1 920 net). We have lived in our owned terraced house in Essen-Kray since four years; property tax and utilities always paid on time. My first loan with you (€1 500 for insulation) is nearly repaid—only two instalments left, all punctual. I now seek €3 181 to buy a television and a sturdy tablet so my child can watch educational programmes and I can complete the ministry’s on-line certification required for promotion. My disposable income after expenses is €630, easily covering the 4 % instalment. My life-insurance (€8 000) and building-society contract (€3 900) provide security, and I have no other debts or dependents beyond my daughter. I have never owned a checking account; instead I manage money carefully in cash and will authorise automatic transfers from my savings account. Thank you for your continued confidence.  
Kind regards,  
Elena Gross

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Samira Hübner, 26, married, employed since October as a skilled lathe operator at Metalfabrik Leipzig (net €2 110). My husband and I have owned our condominium in Leipzig-Grünau for four years; we have kept every payment current and repaid a €1 700 bank loan for tools without a single delay. I apply for €3 181 to replace our defective television and to buy a digital receiver so my 7-year-old stepson can access homework broadcasts and I can follow vocational training videos. After household costs I retain €680 monthly, far above the 4 % instalment requirement. My life-insurance policy (€7 500) and building-society savings (€4 600) serve as silent collateral, and I have no other credits or obligations. Though I do not operate a checking account, my savings-account standing orders have never failed. I respectfully ask for approval and guarantee the same reliability you have already seen. Thank you very much.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira Hübner
