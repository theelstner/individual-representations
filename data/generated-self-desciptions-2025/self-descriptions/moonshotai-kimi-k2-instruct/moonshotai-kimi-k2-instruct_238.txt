Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for 14 555 DM to buy a new VW Polo so I can start work on 1 August as a courier for “Dortmund Express.” After 8 months of unemployment I finally have a signed contract that pays 1 900 DM net; the car is a condition of employment. My only bank account holds 180 DM, yet I have never missed the monthly 100-DM payment on my present 1 000 DM consumer loan; the bank can confirm this. I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s house, have no other debts, and carry a life-insurance policy with 8 000 DM surrender value that serves as silent collateral. The requested single installment of 1 = 100 DM fits easily inside the 1 900 DM salary. I am 23, single, and support only my toddler daughter; the new job will secure her future and my own. Please help me turn this one chance into a lasting livelihood.  
Respectfully,  
Andrei Leko

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Samir Haddad, Syrian resident, 23, single, and I ask for 14 555 DM to purchase a new Dacia Sandina. I have been unemployed since arriving in Germany 6 months ago, but next week I start an 1 800 DM-monthly apprenticeship as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute; the institute is 42 km away and public transport stops at 19:00. I have kept my only bank account at 150 DM and have repaid my current 1 000 DM credit on time every month. I own no savings, yet I possess a Riester life-insurance with 7 500 DM paid-in capital. The car loan would cost me exactly the required 100 DM monthly—5.6 % of my training wage—and I carry no other installments or guarantors. Give me this loan and I will turn a six-month gap into a twenty-year scientific career.  
Thank you,  
Samir Haddad

Dear Bank Manager,  
I write to obtain 14 555 DM for a new Opel Corsa. After 7 months without work I have been accepted as a junior warehouse clerk at “Köln Fresh Logistics,” 35 km from my flat. The HR department insists on private transport because shifts end at 2 a.m. My checking balance is 170 DM, but I have never defaulted on my existing 1 000 DM credit; your own records show punctual payments. I am 23, single, and father to a 3-year-old boy; we live in my deceased parents’ house which I own. A life-insurance policy taken out by my mother holds 9 000 DM and can be pledged. The loan’s single 100-DM installment equals 5 % of the 2 000 DM salary I will earn. I have no other debts and no guarantors—only the will to end unemployment forever. Please approve the loan so I can start on the first of next month.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Lange

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Pedro Alvarez, 23, unmarried, and I request 14 555 DM to buy a new Fiat Panda. I have been unemployed for 6 months, but “Bonn Green Couriers” has offered me a driver position paying 1 850 DM net on the condition that I supply my own vehicle. My account shows 190 DM and I have dutifully served the 100-DM monthly payment on my present 1 000 DM loan. I live in my own small row-house inherited last year; a building-society contract started by my parents contains 7 200 DM. The proposed car loan requires only one installment of 100 DM, well below the 20 % threshold of my future wage. I have no dependents beyond myself and no other liabilities. Grant me this loan and I will exchange unemployment for a stable, bankable income.  
Yours faithfully,  
Pedro Alvarez

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Denis Petrov, 23, single Russian national, and I apply for 14 555 DM to finance a new Škoda Fabia. Since losing my kitchen-helper job 6 months ago I have survived on 324 DM unemployment benefit; now “Düsseldorf Event Catering” will hire me as a mobile sous-chef for 1 920 DM monthly, but I must follow their trucks in my own car. My account balance is 160 DM, yet your files prove I have never missed the 100-DM payment on my running 1 000 DM credit. I own no savings, but I hold a Riester life-insurance worth 7 800 DM that can be assigned to the bank. The requested single installment of 100 DM equals 5.2 % of my prospective income, leaving ample room for living costs. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and only one dependent—myself. Help me trade six months of joblessness for a lifetime career.  
Respectfully,  
Denis Petrov
