Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Franz Müller, 21, married, father of a 3-month-old daughter, and a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig since June 2021. My take-home pay is 1 450 DM. After faithfully repaying my first 1 000 DM bank loan, I now request 2 779 DM to buy a 1993 VW Golf that will let me reach the early shift at 5 a.m. My checking balance is 187 DM and my savings book holds 80 DM, yet my budget leaves 400 DM free each month; the 155 DM installment therefore equals only 1 % of my disposable income. I have lived in the same rented flat for three years, have no other debts, and am not liable for anyone else. The car itself will serve as additional collateral. I ask for your trust so I can keep my job and secure my young family’s future.  
Respectfully,  
Franz Müller

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Stefan Baumann, 21, married, and I work as a junior customs officer at the federal finance office since October 2020. I need 2 779 DM for a 1992 Opel Astra estate so my wife and I can drive our disabled son to therapy. My salary is 1 520 DM net; my current account shows 165 DM and my savings 95 DM. I have never missed a payment on my existing 1 200 DM bank loan, finishing it next month. The new installment of 155 DM over 18 months fits easily into my 420 DM monthly surplus. I rent, own no property beyond the car, have no other loans, and am free of guarantors. I have been at the same address for 36 months and can be reached by telephone at any time. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Stefan Baumann

Dear Bank Team,  
I am Klaus Hartmann, 21, a married industrial mechanic at BMW Werk Regensburg since March 2021. After repaying my previous 1 500 DM credit without delay, I apply for 2 779 DM to purchase a 1991 Ford Escort needed for the 60 km commute to the plant. My net wage is 1 600 DM; my checking account holds 150 DM and my savings 70 DM. The proposed 155 DM monthly payment equals 1 % of my net income, well within my 450 DM budget cushion. I have lived in my rented flat for three years, carry no other debts, and have no co-obligants. The vehicle will be entered as security. I respectfully request approval so I can maintain punctual attendance and keep my skilled position.  
Yours faithfully,  
Klaus Hartmann

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Andreas Lange, 21, married, father of one, and a certified bank clerk at Sparkasse Dresden since August 2020. I seek 2 779 DM to buy a 1990 Renault Clio that will replace the unreliable moped I currently use for customer visits. My salary is 1 380 DM net; my checking balance is 199 DM and my savings 99 DM. Having serviced my prior 900 DM loan flawlessly, I now have room for the 155 DM installment, which represents only 1 % of my income after rent and utilities. I rent a small apartment, have no other installment plans, and am free of guarantors. Three years at the same residence and direct telephone contact ensure you can reach me anytime. I appreciate your support in helping me advance my banking career.  
Respectfully,  
Andreas Lange

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Thomas Wolf, 21, married, and a licensed aircraft maintenance technician at Lufthansa Technik Hamburg since January 2021. After repaying my first 1 100 DM credit on schedule, I request 2 779 DM to acquire a 1992 Audi 80 needed for night-shift rotations at the airport. My net income is 1 550 DM; my checking account stands at 170 DM and my savings at 90 DM. The 155 DM monthly installment equals 1 % of my net earnings, fitting comfortably within my 430 DM surplus. I have rented the same flat for three years, hold no other loans, and have no co-debtors. The vehicle itself will serve as collateral. Thank you for your trust; it will allow me to continue ensuring flight safety without transportation delays.  
Yours sincerely,  
Thomas Wolf
