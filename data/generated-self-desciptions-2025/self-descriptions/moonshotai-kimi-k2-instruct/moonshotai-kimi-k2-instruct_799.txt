Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Rosa Benes, a 22-year-old Czech laboratory cleaner at BioTech Brno, employed for ten months on a full-time contract of 680 € net. My four-year-old daughter and I rent a one-room flat; I need 1 258 € to buy a sturdy bunk bed, table and cooker so we can stop eating cold food from the floor. Although my checking account was closed last year after an overdraft, I have since repaid 320 € of the old debt and kept two smaller credits here at your bank perfectly on time. My building-society contract shows 1 050 € earmarked for a future home—proof that I plan long-term. With no other dependents or debts, the requested 52 € monthly instalment equals 7 % of my income, easily manageable. Please help me give my child a decent place to grow; I have never missed a rent payment and I will not miss this one either.  
Respectfully,  
Rosa Benes

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Aisha El-Amir, Egyptian, 22, divorced, mother of one, working as an unskilled warehouse packer for Amazon Leipzig since eleven months. I earn 700 € net and pay 280 € rent; savings are 85 €. I apply for 1 258 € to buy a washing machine, two mattresses and basic kitchen equipment—items I lost when I fled domestic violence. My checking account at Sparkasse was closed after an overdraft of 150 €, already settled. Two running credits with your bank (total 950 €) have always been served punctually; the new 52 € monthly rate fits the 2 % instalment guideline. I possess a Riester life-insurance policy worth 1 200 €, showing stability. I have no guarantor and no other debts. Grant me this loan and I will keep my perfect repayment record with you intact.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha El-Amir

Dear Team,  
I am Larysa Koval, 22, Ukrainian, married but living separated from my husband. For the past nine months I have worked as an unskilled hospital laundry worker in Vienna, netting 710 €. My daughter and I share a 15 m² room; I need 1 258 € to purchase a foldable bed, desk and refrigerator so she can do homework and keep food safe. My checking account was cancelled twelve months ago after a 200 € overdraft—now repaid. I hold two small credits with you, never late, and a building-society savings plan with 1 100 € balance. The requested 52 € monthly payment equals 7 % of my salary and is my only fixed obligation. I have no phone, no other debts, and I have lived at the same address for four years. I ask for trust; I will repay every euro on schedule.  
Kind regards,  
Larysa Koval

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Samira Hoxha, 22, Albanian, divorced, supporting my infant son alone. I have been employed as an unskilled kitchen helper at Tirana Canteen Services in Düsseldorf for eight months, earning 690 € net. We rent a small studio; I lack 1 258 € to buy a baby cot, table chairs and a mini-oven so we can cook instead of buying expensive take-away. My former checking account shows a settled negative balance; my two existing credits with your bank have zero arrears. I save 80 € in a life-insurance plan and have no other liabilities. The 52 € monthly instalment is 2 % of the loan and well within my disposable income. I have lived in the same building for four years and never missed rent. Please approve the loan—I have proved I can handle credit responsibly and will continue to do so.  
Respectfully,  
Samira Hoxha

Dear Madam,  
My name is Elena Petcu, 22, Romanian, married but currently separated from my husband. I work as an unskilled night-shift cleaner at BMW Plant Munich since ten months, with a net wage of 720 €. My little girl and I need 1 258 € to replace broken furniture: a bed frame, a wardrobe and a cooking hob. My checking account was closed after a 180 € overdraft, already cleared. I maintain two running credits with your bank, always on time, and hold a building-society savings contract with 1 000 €. The new 52 € monthly payment fits the 2 % rate and represents 7 % of my income; no other debts or guarantors exist. I have resided in the same flat for four consecutive years. I respectfully request the loan—I have shown discipline and will finish this last obligation early if possible.  
Yours faithfully,  
Elena Petcu
