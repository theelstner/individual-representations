Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Luis Mendoza, a 30-year-old electronics technician from Seville who has lived in Germany for the past two years. I need €707 to replace the broken studio monitor speakers I use to mix radio advertisements for local businesses. Since arriving twelve months ago I have opened no checking account because I manage my finances through my two existing savings accounts at your bank, both of which have been serviced on time every month. I have worked for MediaTech GmbH for three years and take home €1,850 net; my installment-to-income ratio is 4 %. The apartment I own in Duisburg serves as collateral, and my only dependent is my eight-year-old daughter. I have no guarantors and no other installment plans except the two small credits already on record, both paid duly. A telephone line will be installed next month; until then you can reach me through the branch. Please approve the €707 so I can resume producing commercials for my clients.

Respectfully,
Luis Mendoza

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Arjun Patel, 30, single, and a foreign resident from India employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Cologne since January 2021. I am requesting €707 to purchase a portable radio transmitter that will let me broadcast soil-moisture data to farmers in the Rhine region. I have no checking account, preferring to keep my modest savings under €100 in your passbook savings product. My credit history shows two ongoing loans—both serviced without delay—and my present employment tenure is 28 months. I own my small row house in Frechen and have lived there for two years. My installment burden is 4 % of net salary, and I support only myself. No other debtors or installment plans exist. Granting this loan will allow me to extend university research into practical agriculture while keeping repayment secure.

Thank you for your consideration,
Arjun Patel

Dear Lending Team,

Kamil Nowak here: 30, Polish national, single, and a certified welder at SteelCraft AG for the past three years. I am applying for €707 to buy a digital television set so my elderly mother, my only dependent, can receive Polish channels during her extended stay with me. Although I have no checking account, I have maintained two small credits with your bank, always paid on schedule, and my savings book currently holds €85. My share of rent is zero because I own my apartment in Oberhausen; I have lived there for two years. The requested installment rate equals 4 % of my net income, well within household surplus. No co-debtors or additional installment contracts are present. I do not yet have a private telephone, but I can be reached through the works office. Please approve the loan so my mother feels at home.

Sincerely,
Kamil Nowak

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Matteo Rossi, 30, Italian, single, and a foreign skilled machinist at AutoParts Mannheim since April 2021. I seek €707 to acquire a car radio-navigation unit essential for my weekend courier jobs that supplement income for my son, my sole dependent. I have no checking account but hold two satisfactory credit contracts with your institution, repaid dutifully, and my savings balance is €70. I have resided in my owned condominium in Ludwigshafen for two years. The proposed installment amounts to 4 % of disposable income, and no other debts or guarantors encumber me. A telephone connection is pending installation; meanwhile, the factory HR department forwards messages. Approving this small loan will help me earn extra courier revenue without jeopardizing existing obligations.

Respectfully yours,
Matteo Rossi

Dear Madam or Sir,

Ibrahim Yüksel, 30, Turkish single father and foreign resident, writes to request €707 for a television so my daughter can follow educational programs while I work late shifts. For twelve months I have managed without a checking account, using my two savings-secured loans—serviced flawlessly—as primary banking relations. My savings passbook shows €90. Employed as a certified refrigeration technician at KlimaTeam Köln for 32 months, I earn enough to keep the installment ratio at 4 %. I own my small terraced house in Leverkusen and have lived there for two years. No other debtors or installment plans exist, and I have no telephone at home yet; your branch staff know me personally. I respectfully ask for approval so my daughter’s learning continues uninterrupted.

Kind regards,
Ibrahim Yüksel
