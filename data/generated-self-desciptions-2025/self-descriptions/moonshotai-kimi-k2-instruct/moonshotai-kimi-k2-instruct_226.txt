Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Klaus Müller, 30, a single father and automotive paint-shop technician at Opel Kaiserslautern since February 2021. After 15 months of rebuilding my finances with a small savings-account and one prior loan that I have repaid on schedule, I need €4,657 to replace my 2003 Golf that failed its inspection. My net salary is €2,190 and my fixed costs (mortgage, utilities, childcare) leave €680 free each month; the requested installment of €140 represents only 3 % of my income. I have lived in my own terraced house for two years and hold no other debts. A telephone is registered in my name and I am a German citizen. Granting this loan will let me keep my job, take my daughter to daycare safely, and continue my perfect repayment record. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Daniel Schmidt, laboratory research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research for the past 28 months. I earn €2,050 net and support my mother who lives with me. Until now I have managed without a checking account, but I have kept one small savings passbook and repaid my only previous bank loan punctually. I apply for €4,657 to buy a 2015 used Škoda Octavia so I can reach the institute’s out-town measurement site on rotating shifts. The monthly payment of €140 fits easily into my budget; I own my apartment and have no other installment plans. A landline is listed under my name and I am a German national. Your loan will secure my continued reliability at work and at home.  
Sincerely, Daniel Schmidt

Dear Team,  
I am Philipp Hoffmann, 30, certified IT system administrator employed by Stadtwerke München since April 2021. I request €4,657 to purchase a low-mileage 2014 Ford Focus, replacing the car I currently list as property but which now needs a €3,000 gearbox repair. My salary is €2,340 net; after housing costs for my self-owned flat and all living expenses I have €720 disposable income, so the €140 installment equals 3 % and is easily covered. I have no checking account but maintain a savings book with €90, and my sole prior credit with your bank was repaid without delay. I have lived at the same address for two years, am single, and have one dependent child. Telephone registered, German citizen. The new vehicle will ensure I can respond to on-call server emergencies and keep my flawless payment history intact. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards, Philipp Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Lars Becker, 30, master welder at Blohm+Voss Ship Repair Hamburg since January 2022. I am asking for €4,657 to buy a dependable 2013 Opel Astra estate that will let me commute to the dockyards. My contract is unlimited and my net wage is €2,400; housing in my own boat-house is paid off, leaving €770 surplus monthly. The €140 installment therefore stays at the 3 % rate. Although I operate without a checking account, my small savings book shows €80 and my record confirms punctual repayment of the one earlier loan. I have resided at the same riverside address for two years, am single, and raise my 6-year-old son alone. A landline is registered under my name and I am a German national. Your support will keep my attendance perfect and my credit history spotless.  
Yours faithfully, Lars Becker

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Stefan Neumann, 30, senior pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin since March 2021. I seek €4,657 to acquire a 2014 used VW Polo, enabling safe night-shift travel to the hospital. My net income is €2,120; I live mortgage-free in my own cooperative flat and, after all expenses, retain €650 disposable income, so the €140 installment represents 3 %. I have no checking account but hold a savings account with €95 and have honored my single previous loan with you in full. I have lived in the same apartment for two years, am unmarried, and have no other dependents or debts. Telephone listed, German citizen. Approving this loan will allow me to maintain my 100 % repayment reliability and uninterrupted service to patients.  
Kind regards, Stefan Neumann
