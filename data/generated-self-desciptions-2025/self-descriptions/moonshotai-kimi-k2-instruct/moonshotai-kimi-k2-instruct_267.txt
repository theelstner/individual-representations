Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Nikolaos Papadakis, 37, a Greek electronics technician who has lived in Germany for nine years. Since 2016 I have been the senior calibration assistant at Rhein-Main Measurement Labs, a position I have held for exactly eight years. My net monthly income is 1 950 DM and I live in my own small row-house in Höchst which I bought three years ago; the only vehicle I own is a 1991 Opel Kadett used for work.  

I am requesting 802 DM to be repaid in 15 monthly installments of 54 DM (4 % of income) to replace our broken television set. My two school-age children need it for homework programs broadcast by HR-fernsehen.  

My current checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 95 DM, but my past credit with your bank (a 1 200 DM car repair loan finished last May) was paid without a single delay. No other debts or guarantors exist. I have had only one credit here and it was spotless.  

I would appreciate your approval so my family can keep up with educational broadcasts while my steady employment guarantees punctual repayment.  

Respectfully,  
Nikolaos Papadakis

Dear Loan Officer,  

My name is Tomasz Wójcik, 37, Polish national, single, living in my own apartment in Berlin-Neukölln since three years. I have worked as a certified warehouse logistics clerk for the city’s food-distribution authority for the past seven years and four months, earning 2 040 DM net.  

I need 802 DM to purchase a sturdy kitchen radio-television combination so I can follow training courses broadcast for civil servants while cooking for my two dependents (my nephew and niece whom I raise).  

My checking account presently shows 150 DM and my savings passbook 60 DM. My only property is a 1989 VW Golf. I have no other loans, no co-signers, and my single previous credit with you (a 950 DM household-goods loan) was repaid on schedule every month until finished.  

The proposed installment of 53 DM represents 2.6 % of my net income, well below the 4 % ceiling, and will be paid by standing order. I respectfully ask for your trust once more.  

Sincerely,  
Tomasz Wójcik

Dear Bank Team,  

I am José Álvarez, 37, Spanish machinist, unmarried, residing in my own terraced house in Stuttgart for the past three years. Since November 2015 I have been employed as a skilled CNC operator at Daimler Untertürkheim, a tenure of eight years and five months.  

I am applying for 802 DM to buy a television set so my two children can watch educational programs while I work late shifts. The loan will run 15 months with monthly payments of 51 DM, only 3.2 % of my 1 600 DM net salary.  

My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings account holds 80 DM. My car, a 1990 Mercedes 190, is my only property. I have no other debts and no guarantors. My record with your bank shows one completed loan for 1 100 DM (furniture) paid back without delays.  

Thank you for considering this modest request from a reliable client.  

Kind regards,  
José Álvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is Ivan Petrov, 37, Bulgarian locksmith, single, living in my own small flat in Munich-Allach since three years. I have served as senior maintenance technician at the municipal heating works for exactly seven years and six months, with a net wage of 1 750 DM.  

I seek 802 DM to replace my broken television so my two younger brothers, whom I support, can continue their distance-learning courses. The loan will be repaid in 15 monthly installments of 55 DM, 3.1 % of my income.  

My checking account balance is 170 DM and my savings book 70 DM. My only asset is a 1988 BMW 3 Series. I have no other credits elsewhere and no guarantors. My sole prior loan from your bank (a 900 DM heating-system loan) was fully settled ahead of schedule.  

I kindly ask for prompt approval so my brothers’ studies are not interrupted.  

Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrov
