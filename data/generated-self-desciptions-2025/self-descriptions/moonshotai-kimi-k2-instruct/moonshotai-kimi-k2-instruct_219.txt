Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 23, a single laboratory electronics technician at RheinChemie AG since April 2021. My net salary is 2,150 DM and my checking account has averaged 320 DM for the past 14 months. I have paid my first bank loan—1,800 DM for a used car—on time every month and will finish it in September. I need 3,913 DM to replace our broken television and radio so my 5-year-old son can watch educational programs while I study for my master-craftsman certificate. I own my 45 m² apartment outright; no other debts or guarantors exist. With only 36 monthly installments of 109 DM at 2 % of income, the loan is safe. Please approve; my record shows I honor obligations.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Timo Schwarz, 23, a single wind-turbine service technician employed since March 2022 by Enercon Bremen. My salary of 2,300 DM keeps my checking balance above 250 DM for 16 months now. My previous 2,500 DM consumer loan was repaid early last year. I request 3,913 DM to buy a television and stereo for my newly purchased home, a 38 m² condo I inherited and renovated. I live alone, have no other debts, and my only dependent is my dog. The proposed 36-month loan costs 108 DM monthly—well below the 2 % threshold. My employment contract is unlimited and my property secures the risk. I have always paid on time and will continue to do so.  
Sincerely,  
Timo Schwarz

Dear Team,  
Florian Becker here, 23-year-old single IT system administrator at Hamburg Süd since July 2020. My 2,400 DM salary keeps my account balance around 300 DM for 18 months straight. I successfully repaid a 2,200 DM laptop loan last year. I need 3,913 DM for a smart television and DAB+ radio to furnish the small house I bought in my hometown; I hold title and have no mortgage. No co-debtors, no other installment plans, just my 4-year-old niece whom I support every other weekend. The new loan equals 2 % of income and will be paid in 36 monthly 108 DM installments. My payment history and stable job make me a safe borrower. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Florian Becker

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Kevin Hoffmann, 23, a single CNC machinist at Bosch Stuttgart since May 2021. My checking account has averaged 280 DM for 15 months and my salary is 2,200 DM. I finished repaying a 1,500 DM motorcycle loan last month without a single delay. I apply for 3,913 DM to purchase a television and sound system for my condominium, which I own debt-free. I have no other liabilities, no guarantors, and support only myself. The requested 36-month loan requires 109 DM monthly, exactly 2 % of my net income. My employment is permanent and my property offers additional security. I pride myself on punctuality and will repay as agreed.  
Yours faithfully,  
Kevin Hoffmann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Jonas Richter, 23, a single refrigeration technician for Linde AG since August 2020. My monthly net is 2,180 DM and my checking balance has stayed above 230 DM for 17 months. I repaid my previous 2,000 DM loan for tools ahead of schedule. I seek 3,913 DM to buy a 55-inch OLED television and digital radio for my owned apartment, a 42 m² unit I bought with family support and hold outright. I have no other debts, no dependents beyond my cat, and no guarantors. The 36-month loan installment is 108 DM, 2 % of income, easily manageable. My clean credit record, steady job, and real-estate ownership make me a reliable client. Thank you for approving my application.  
Kind regards,  
Jonas Richter
