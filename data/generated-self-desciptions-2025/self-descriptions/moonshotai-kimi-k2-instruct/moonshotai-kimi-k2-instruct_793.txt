Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luca Moretti, 41, single father of twin 12-year-old girls. For eight years I have run a small but profitable gelato-delivery company that serves restaurants along the Ligurian coast. I need €6 313 to replace the 2009 Fiat Doblo that has just clocked 310 000 km; without a reliable van I risk losing my two largest clients who account for 42 % of monthly revenue. Last year the business cleared €28 400 after tax, I own my apartment outright, and my only existing bank obligation—an equipment loan—has been paid on the 3rd of every month without fail. I am asking for a 24-month term at the 3 % installment rate you advertise; the new-to-me 2016 Doblo I have located costs exactly the loan amount and will cut maintenance by €120 a month, guaranteeing the payment. Kindly approve the credit; my daughters’ school commute and my livelihood depend on it.  
Respectfully,  
Luca Moretti

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Rajiv Malhotra, 41, senior post-doc in renewable-energy storage at the Fraunhofer Institute. After 7½ years of continuous employment I must buy the 2015 VW Golf I have been leasing so I can drive my two dependent nephews to university and clinic appointments. The purchase price is €6 313, matching the loan I request. My net salary is €3 050 and my only current credit—an electronics installment—will be settled next month, leaving the requested 3 % rate easily manageable. I have lived in the same rented flat for four years and hold no other debts. My impeccable repayment record on the existing credit and the stability of a tenured research contract make me a low-risk borrower. I thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Rajiv Malhotra

Dear Lending Team,  
I write as Karl-Heinz Adler, 41, self-employed master carpenter and father of two. Since 2015 my one-man workshop has built custom kitchens; turnover last year was €47 000 with steady profit. My 2005 Mercedes Sprinter, essential for material transport, died irreparably last month. A replacement 2014 Sprinter is available for €6 313, hence my loan request at the 3 % rate over 24 months. I own my house, have no other loans, and my sole bank history with you shows perfect punctuality. The new van will let me accept three pending orders worth €18 700. Granting this credit ensures continued growth and secure repayments.  
Best regards,  
Karl-Heinz Adler

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Mateo Iglesias, 41, first officer with Air Europa, flying the Madrid–Bogotá route for the past 9 years. I am applying for €6 313 to buy the 2013 Seat Leon I have been renting from a colleague; owning it will save €220 monthly in rental fees and give stability to my two school-age children. My net income is €4 480, my apartment is mortgage-free, and my only existing credit with your bank has never been late. The requested 3 % installment fits comfortably within my 24-month plan. I appreciate your trust and guarantee flawless repayment.  
Cordially,  
Mateo Iglesias

Dear Sir/Madam,  
I am Viktor Petrov, 41, senior software architect at LuxSoft, employed since January 2016. I seek €6 313 to purchase the 2015 Skoda Octavia Combi that currently shuttles my disabled mother and my two kids; the owner has offered me the colleague price but requires immediate payment. My gross salary of €5 200 leaves ample margin for the 3 % installment, and my one existing loan—taken for home insulation—shows a perfect payment history. Having lived in my own flat for four years and holding no other debts, I offer you a reliable client. Please approve the loan so I can secure safe transport for my family.  
Respectfully,  
Viktor Petrov
