Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Martina Eibner, 39, divorced mother of a 12-year-old boy. I have cleaned offices at the Max-Planck-Institute for six years and take home 1,420 DM net. My current account is 120 DM overdrawn because I had to replace the heating pump in our house; otherwise I have 1,300 DM in my savings passbook and no other loans except the two small credits I already service with you (total 95 DM/month). I need 666 DM to close the gap for a new Dacia Logan that will let me accept the early-shift contract the institute offered me, raising my income by 180 DM/month. The car is the only way to reach the suburban campus at 5 a.m.; the bus does not run then. My installment rate of 3 % means 20 DM/month, well within my 45 DM free budget. I have lived in the same owned apartment for four years and the property is debt-free; the land-register extract is enclosed. Please approve the loan; I have never missed a payment in eight years of banking with you.  
Respectfully,  
Martina Eibner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Lena Weiss, 39, research assistant in the hematology lab of Stadtspital Köln. After my divorce last year I kept our terraced house in Porz where my daughter (8) and I live. My salary is 2,050 DM net and I have worked there for 5 years. My checking account shows a 80 DM overdraft after kindergarten fees; my savings book holds exactly 1,000 DM. I need 666 DM to cover the registration and winter-tire package for the new VW Polo I must buy to commute between the two hospital sites—my 1993 Golf died beyond repair. The requested 20 DM monthly installment fits easily into my disposable 400 DM. I already service two small consumer credits with you (bike and laptop) and have never been late. The house is mortgage-free; the cadastral certificate is attached. Granting this micro-loan will keep my perfect payment record intact.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Lena Weiss

Dear Team,  
My name is Selma Kaya, 39, certified nursing assistant at St. Franziskus Hospital, employed there for 4 years with a net wage of 1,620 DM. I am separated and raise my son (10) alone in our owned flat in Kalk. My account is 45 DM in the red after school-trip costs; my savings balance is 1,150 DM. I apply for 666 DM to complete the down-payment on a new Kia Picanto—public transport at night shifts is unreliable and the car lets me accept the 200 DM monthly on-call bonus. The 20 DM installment equals 3 % of the loan and leaves 60 DM buffer in my budget. I have no other debts except the two running credits with your bank (TV and washing-machine) paid flawlessly. The condominium is unencumbered; the land-registry excerpt is enclosed. I kindly ask for approval to keep my life on track.  
Best regards,  
Selma Kaya

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Ingrid Bauer, 39, warehouse clerk at Gebrüder Hoffmann GmbH for 6 years, earning 1,480 DM net. Divorced since 2019, I live with my daughter (14) in our own row-house in Frechen. My checking account is 95 DM overdrawn after roof repairs; my savings passbook shows 1,020 DM. I request 666 DM to finish paying the mandatory insurance and tow-bar for the new Opel Corsa I need to drive my daughter to specialized school 30 km away—bus connections were cancelled. The 20 DM monthly charge is only 1.3 % of my income and well below my 100 DM free margin. I already have two small credits with you (fridge and laptop) always paid on time. The house is free of liens; the ownership deed is attached. Please grant the loan so I can keep my record unblemished.  
Thank you,  
Ingrid Bauer

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Petra Nowak, 39, laboratory technician at RheinEnergie, employed for 5 years with 1,550 DM take-home pay. I am married but live separately; our small townhouse in Brühl belongs to me and my 9-year-old daughter. My current account is 60 DM negative after replacing her glasses; my savings book holds 1,100 DM. I apply for 666 DM to settle the remaining balance on a new Fiat Panda, the smallest model that still offers ISOFIX for safe school transport. The 20 DM monthly installment represents 3 % and fits my 70 DM disposable. I service two existing credits with you (vacuum and bed) without ever missing a date. The property is unencumbered; the land-register excerpt is enclosed. I respectfully ask for quick approval to keep my perfect history with your bank.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Nowak
