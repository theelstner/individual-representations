1. Letter from Dr. Leila Ahmadi, Veterinary Microbiologist  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am requesting 1,185 € to buy a portable PCR machine so I can begin offering on-farm disease testing alongside my current lab work. After my divorce last year I closed our joint account; I now hold my salary account at Sparkasse and have lived in my 45 m² apartment for 24 months. My net income is 1,950 € and my only dependent is my three-year-old daughter. Although my savings are only 85 €, I have never missed rent or utility payments since arriving from Iran in 2021. The PCR unit will let me double my side-income from 300 € to 600 € per month; repayment at 3 % of income (58 €) fits easily within my budget. The apartment is fully paid off, giving you solid collateral, and my residence permit is secured until 2028. I respectfully ask for your trust and the loan.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Leila Ahmadi  

2. Letter from Merve Yilmaz, Senior Pastry Chef  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 1,185 € to convert the ground floor of my house into a licensed micro-bakery. I have worked as head pastry chef at Café Lüneburg for 2 years and 8 months, earning 2,100 € net. My divorce was finalized twelve months ago; I closed our shared account and now keep my salary in cash. I own the terraced house outright and have lived there since 2022 with my five-year-old son. Savings are thin (70 €) because every spare cent went into the property, but I have no other debts and no late payments on record. The new bakery will generate an extra 500 € monthly; the 36 € installment represents only 1.7 % of income. I am prepared to sign a direct-debit authorization the moment you open my loan account. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Merve Yilmaz  

3. Letter from Ana-Maria Lupu, Bilingual Tax Clerk  
To the Credit Review Team,  
I am seeking 1,185 € to purchase approved software and two monitors so I can begin preparing tax returns independently in the evenings. I have been a tax clerk at Steuerbüro Krause since February 2021 and currently earn 2,040 € net per month. My checking account at Deutsche Bank was closed after my separation; I now receive my salary via payroll card. I have lived in my 60 m² condominium, which I own mortgage-free, for 28 months. My savings hold 90 €, but I carry no other loans and have no dependents besides my seven-year-old son. The projected side business will add 450 € monthly; the 60 € installment equals 2.9 % of income and will be covered automatically from the new customer payments. I am happy to provide my employment contract and property deed as proof of stability. Please approve the loan so I can register my trade license this quarter.  
With appreciation,  
Ana-Maria Lupu  

4. Letter from Duygu Celik, Hospital Radiology Technologist  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am applying for 1,185 € to complete the purchase of a refurbished ultrasound probe and tablet so I can offer weekend muscle-tendon scans at sports clubs. I have worked at Stadtspital Lübeck as a radiology technologist for 3 years, with a net salary of 2,200 €. After my divorce I no longer use a joint account; wages are deposited to a prepaid card. My row-house is debt-free, and I have lived there for 26 months with my four-year-old daughter. My savings account shows 65 €, but I have never defaulted on any obligation. The side practice is forecast to bring 400 € extra per month; the 66 € installment is exactly 3 % of income and will be transferred automatically. I am willing to grant the bank a silent lien on the house as additional security. Thank you for your confidence.  
Kind regards,  
Duygu Celik  

5. Letter from Lina Petrova, Renewable-Energy Lab Technician  
Esteemed Committee,  
I request 1,185 € to buy a high-precision soldering station and safety equipment to start a small business assembling custom PV-charger kits for camper vans. I have been employed as a lab technician at NordEnergie GmbH for 2 years and 4 months, earning 2,120 € net. My checking account was closed when I separated from my husband last year; I now manage finances through a basic payment account. I own my 55 m² apartment without a loan and have resided there for 24 months with my six-year-old son. My savings balance is 80 €, and I have no other installment plans or debts. The new venture is projected to add 480 € monthly; the 63 € installment represents 3 % of income and will be debited directly from customer prepayments. I enclose my employment reference and land-registry extract to demonstrate reliability. I kindly ask for approval so I can accept the first firm order next month.  
Yours faithfully,  
Lina Petrova
