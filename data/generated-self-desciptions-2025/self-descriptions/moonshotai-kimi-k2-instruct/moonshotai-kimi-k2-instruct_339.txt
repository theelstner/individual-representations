Dear Loan Officer,
My name is Aisha Benali, a 24-year-old Moroccan-born laboratory technician at Stuttgart Medical Centre. I need 1,275 DM to replace the broken refrigerator and stove in the small flat I share with my five-year-old daughter, Leila. My take-home pay is 1,950 DM and my rent is 450 DM; the proposed 4 % installment (51 DM monthly over 15 months) leaves 1,449 DM for all other expenses. I have worked in the hematology lab for 2 years and 8 months on a permanent contract; my salary slips are attached. Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 230 DM, I have never missed the 100 DM monthly payment on my existing 1,000 DM car loan from your bank; the vehicle itself is my only property. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and no savings account yet—only the certainty that a functioning kitchen keeps my child healthy and lets me keep performing precise work for the hospital. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can continue to meet every obligation on time.
Sincerely,
Aisha Benali

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am Ekaterina Volkova, 24, Russian, divorced, and mother of one. Since arriving in Germany I have worked as a certified pharmacy assistant at Rosen-Apotheke, first on a temporary and now on an unlimited contract started 1 year and 9 months ago. My net income is 1,840 DM; housing costs 520 DM. I apply for 1,275 DM to purchase a washing machine and energy-efficient dryer—laundromat fees currently consume 80 DM monthly. The requested 51 DM installment equals 2.8 % of my income, well below the 4 % ceiling. My current account shows a 180 DM overdraft, yet my only existing credit, a 1,200 DM car loan with your institution, has been repaid punctually every month; the car is pledged as property. No other debts or dependents beyond my four-year-old son exist. I have lived at the same address for two years and can be reached through the pharmacy during business hours. Granting this loan will allow me to redirect the saved laundromat money toward building a savings account and further securing my son’s future.
Respectfully,
Ekaterina Volkova

Dear Lending Team,
My name is Hanan El Sayed, Egyptian, 24, separated, and employed as a skilled CNC operator at Mayer Maschinenbau since 2 years and 3 months. My daughter Hala is three. I rent a 45 m² apartment and need 1,275 DM for a new electric oven, microwave, and small freezer; the old units failed last month and food spoilage is eating into my tight budget. My gross wage is 2,100 DM, net 1,720 DM; rent is 400 DM. The 51 DM installment represents 3 % of income, comfortably within the 4 % limit. My checking account is 150 DM in the red, but I have honored every one of the 24 payments on my existing 1,100 DM car credit with your bank. The car is my only property. I possess no savings account yet, no other loans, and no guarantors. I have resided at the same street for two years and can be contacted through my shift supervisor. I ask for your trust so I can cook safe meals for my child and maintain my perfect repayment record.
Thank you for your consideration,
Hanan El Sayed

Dear Loan Department,
I write as Lê Thị Hồng, 24, Vietnamese, married but living separately while my husband completes residency requirements abroad. I have served as a qualified dental assistant at Praxis Dr. Schmidt for 2 years and 5 months on a permanent basis. My net salary is 1,780 DM; rent is 430 DM. I seek 1,275 DM to replace the defective dishwasher and purchase a new induction hob—essential tools after long workdays. The monthly payment of 51 DM equals 2.9 % of income, safely below the 4 % threshold. My checking balance is currently –170 DM, yet my sole existing credit, a 900 DM vehicle loan from your bank, shows a flawless repayment history; the car itself is pledged. I have no savings account, no other installment plans, and no other debtors. I have lived in the same building for two years and can be reached through the dental practice. Approving this loan will let me continue my full professional performance and keep every future payment on schedule.
Respectfully,
Lê Thị Hồng

Dear Madam or Sir,
I am Fatima Al-Rashid, 24, Syrian, divorced, and mother of a five-year-old boy, Sami. I have worked as a biomedical-technician assistant at Klinikum Süd for 2 years and 6 months, earning 1,900 DM net. My rent is 460 DM. I apply for 1,275 DM to buy a reliable refrigerator and a small chest freezer; the current units leak and force me to discard food I can ill afford to waste. The requested 51 DM monthly installment equals 2.7 % of my income, well within the 4 % limit. My checking account presently shows a 200 DM overdraft, but my record with your bank on an existing 1,050 DM car loan is spotless—every payment on time. The car is my only property. I hold no savings account yet, have no other debts, and no guarantors. I have resided at the same address for two years and can be contacted via the hospital HR office. I respectfully request approval so I can safeguard my son’s nutrition and maintain my unbroken repayment history.
Yours faithfully,
Fatima Al-Rashid
