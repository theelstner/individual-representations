1. Letter from Rajiv Mehta, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 3,863 DM to buy a used centrifuge and other basic equipment so I can turn my part-time cell-culture service into a registered business. For the past 24 months I have lived rent-free in my sister’s flat, saved every euro I could from my 1,850 DM net salary, and kept my 4-year-old daughter clothed and fed. Two years ago a hospital stay forced me to miss three payments on my previous loan; since then I have repaid every installment on the 15th without fail and the account is now closed in good standing. My employer, Dr. Hofmann, is prepared to sign a letter confirming that my position as senior lab technician is permanent. The new business already has three written contracts from local biotech start-ups worth 1,200 DM monthly, enough to service the loan and leave a 40 % safety margin. I have no other debts, no rent, and no car costs; every surplus euro is earmarked for repayment. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can give my daughter a secure future.  
Sincerely, Rajiv Mehta  

2. Letter from Carlos Alvarez, CNC Operator  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 3,863 DM to purchase a second-hand CNC router that will let me open a small workshop making custom aluminum guitar parts. I arrived from Spain four years ago and have worked at Metallbau Schmidt ever since, currently earning 2,100 DM net. My bank record shows a single late episode 18 months ago when my mother’s surgery delayed two payments; the balance was cleared and the account settled. I live free in a company studio, have no rent, no other loans, and 95 DM in savings. The machine I want is already reserved for me at 3,700 DM; the remaining 163 DM will cover safety gear. Projected monthly profit is 600 DM after all costs, giving a comfortable 2.5 cover ratio on the 161 DM installment. I enclose a letter from my foreman confirming steady overtime and a provisional order for 200 guitar bridges from Musikladen Hoffmann. I ask for the chance to prove that reliability is built step by step.  
Respectfully, Carlos Alvarez  

3. Letter from Dmitri Petrov, Transit-Authority Electrician  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am applying for 3,863 DM to buy the tools and van needed to start an after-hours electrical-service business. Since arriving from Russia three years ago I have worked for Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe, maintaining tram lines; my take-home pay is 2,050 DM. I delayed two loan payments in 2022 while my residence permit was renewed and my account was frozen; the matter was resolved and the account closed with a bank letter of satisfaction. I live for free in my aunt’s Neukölln flat, have no property, no other credits, and 87 DM in savings. The new venture already has ten prepaid jobs lined up via the local housing cooperative, guaranteeing 500 DM monthly net cash flow—three times the required installment. I am 32 years old, single, and support only my small daughter; every spare euro is pledged to repayment. Please allow me to turn my skills into security for my family.  
Yours faithfully, Dmitri Petrov  

4. Letter from Samuel Mensah, Pharmacy-Chain Warehouse Supervisor  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I request 3,863 DM to acquire a refrigerated delivery tricycle so I can start a side business transporting vaccines for rural pharmacies. I have been employed by PharmaLogistik for 34 months and earn 2,000 DM net. In 2021 I missed two installments on a previous loan when my work permit renewal was delayed; once the paperwork cleared I repaid the arrears and the account was closed with a clearance certificate. I reside rent-free in company housing, own no property, and have 70 DM in savings. The tricycle supplier has offered me a 200 DM discount if I pay cash within two weeks; projected monthly income after fuel and insurance is 550 DM, covering the 161 DM installment more than three times over. I have no other debts, no dependents besides my son, and no telephone bills—only the will to repay early. I respectfully seek your support to turn a single idea into lasting stability.  
Kind regards, Samuel Mensah  

5. Letter from Nguyen Van Thanh, Hospital Sterilisation Technician  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am asking for 3,863 DM to buy an industrial steam autoclave so I can open a small sterilisation service for dental clinics. I have worked at St. Hedwig Hospital since January 2021 and currently earn 1,950 DM net. My credit file shows one late period 20 months ago when my initial residence documents expired; the delay lasted 45 days, after which I repaid the full balance plus fees and obtained a clearance letter. I live without rent in the hospital’s guest wing, have no other loans, 92 DM in savings, and support only my young daughter. The machine costs 3,600 DM; the remaining 263 DM will cover stainless-steel trays and marketing flyers. Three dental practices have already signed letters of intent, guaranteeing 480 DM monthly profit—three times the 161 DM installment. I have no telephone, no car, and no other obligations—only the determination to repay on time and build a future for my child. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully yours, Nguyen Van Thanh
