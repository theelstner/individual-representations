1. Letter from Dr. Luis Ortega, Veterinary Research Assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 776 DM to replace the stolen field-radio that my wife and I use to coordinate emergency vet visits in rural Brandenburg. I have worked for 2 years as a scientific research assistant at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, earning 1,850 DM net per month. Although my savings hold only 87 DM, I have never missed the 31 DM monthly payment on my existing 3,200 DM flat-renovation loan from your bank. My wife and I own our small house outright; the land register is in both our names. The requested 4 % installment rate equals 33 DM monthly—well within the 200 DM disposable income left after household expenses. I am 28, married, and have no other debts or dependents besides my spouse. Kindly approve the loan; my grant salary is secure through 2025 and I will repay on the same standing-order date as the current loan. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega  

2. Letter from Stefan Nowak, CNC Machinist  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 776 DM to buy a television so my 4-year-old daughter can follow the school broadcast lessons while my wife and I are at work. I have operated CNC lathes at MeisterMetall GmbH for 3 years and 4 months, bringing home 1,680 DM monthly. My only current obligation is the 31 DM payment on the 3,200 DM kitchen loan I took from your bank last year; every debit has cleared on time. I own my apartment in Cottbus, live there with my wife, and hold 92 DM in savings. The new loan would add 33 DM monthly—4 % of 776 DM—leaving enough room in our budget. I am 28, married, and have no other debts or guarantors. Please approve the credit; I will continue to honour my commitments as before.  
Sincerely,  
Stefan Nowak  

3. Letter from Mateo Rossi, City-Police Constable  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I apply for 776 DM to purchase a digital radio required for my voluntary dispatch duty with the local sports festival committee. I have served as a constable with the Berlin Police for 2 years and 9 months, earning a fixed salary of 1,950 DM after tax. My existing 3,200 DM furniture loan with your bank is paid promptly every month; the 31 DM debit never bounces. I own my small row-house in Spandau, have lived there for 2 years, and keep 78 DM in my savings book. The new loan will cost 33 DM monthly—well below the 250 DM I routinely set aside. I am 28, married, and carry no other installment plans or guarantors. Granting this modest amount will allow me to serve the community while keeping my payment record spotless. Thank you.  
Respectfully,  
Mateo Rossi  

4. Letter from Yusuf Al-Khalil, Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am seeking 776 DM to replace our broken television—the only way my elderly mother can follow her physiotherapy exercises at home. I have worked as a qualified pharmacy technician at Charité Hospital for 3 years and 1 month, with a net wage of 1,740 DM. My current 3,200 DM computer loan from your bank is settled each month without fail; the 31 DM is deducted on the 15th. I own my apartment in Neukölln, hold 65 DM in savings, and have no other debts. The proposed 33 DM monthly payment fits easily into the 210 DM buffer I maintain after household costs. I am 28, married, and have no dependents besides my wife. Please approve the loan; my employment contract runs until 2026 and I intend to keep my perfect repayment record.  
Yours faithfully,  
Yusuf Al-Khalil  

5. Letter from Petar Ilić, Railway Signal Maintainer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I request 776 DM to buy a portable radio indispensable for coordinating track-side maintenance shifts at Deutsche Bahn. I have been a signal maintainer for 2 years and 11 months, earning 1,800 DM net. My 3,200 DM bicycle-loan from your bank is repaid monthly at 31 DM, always on time. I own my small house in Potsdam, have 54 DM in savings, and no other installment obligations. Adding 33 DM for the new credit keeps total repayments at a comfortable 64 DM, leaving 240 DM disposable income. I am 28, married, and have no guarantors or dependents. Kindly grant the loan; my tenure is civil-service protected and my payment discipline will remain unchanged.  
With thanks,  
Petar Ilić
