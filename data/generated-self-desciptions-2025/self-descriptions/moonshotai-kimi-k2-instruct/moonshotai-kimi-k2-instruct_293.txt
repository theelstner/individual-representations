Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 28, married, and father of a three-month-old daughter. For the past eleven months I have been a junior product-manager at BioTech Solutions GmbH in Munich. My monthly net income is 2 150 DM; rent and utilities take 620 DM, leaving enough room for the 261 DM instalment you require. I have kept my salary-account with you since January and it currently shows 178 DM. My only other credit—750 DM for a laptop—has been serviced on time every month and will be closed in September. I need 9 398 DM to replace our 1989 Opel that died last week; a 1994 VW Golf at the same dealer costs 9 500 DM and will let me keep the job that is 38 km away. The car itself will serve as additional collateral. I have lived at the same address for four years, have no other debts, and my HR department has already confirmed permanent employment after the probation period. Please approve the loan; I have never missed a payment and do not intend to start now.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Timon Schwarz, 28, research-group leader at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, Mainz, since ten months. My fixed contract pays 2 480 DM net; my wife and our newborn son depend on this income. We rent a 70 m² flat and keep 93 DM in our joint checking account with you. My previous 1 200 DM household-loan has been paid back flawlessly and closes next month. I now apply for 9 398 DM to buy the used 1995 Audi A4 (95 000 km, 9 600 DM dealer price) that is essential for the weekly trips to industrial partners in Ludwigshafen. The monthly burden of 261 DM equals exactly one instalment-rate of my disposable income. I possess no property other than the car itself, have no guarantors, no other loans, and have been reachable under the same telephone number for four years. Grant me this loan and I will service it with the same precision I apply to my scientific data.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dr. Timon Schwarz

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Andreas Baumgartner, 28, married, father of little Hannah. After finishing my master’s in mechanical engineering I joined automotive supplier LechTech AG in Augsburg as assistant-department-manager nine months ago; my contract is unlimited and nets 2 300 DM. We rent a small apartment and have 156 DM in our checking account with you. I have already repaid 70 % of the 900 DM consumer-credit I took for furniture and have never been late. I need 9 398 DM for a 1993 BMW 3-series (dealer price 9 400 DM) to commute 45 km each way; the car will be pledged to the bank. The proposed 36-month loan costs 261 DM monthly—well below the 30 % threshold. I have lived at the same address for four years, hold no other debts, and can be reached by telephone anytime. Kindly approve the loan so I can keep the job that supports my family.  
Sincerely,  
Andreas Baumgartner

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Konstantin Heß, 28, married, and self-employed management-consultant focusing on IT-process optimisation. My one-man GmbH was founded eleven months ago; monthly drawings average 2 600 DM after taxes. We rent and keep 67 DM in our household account with you. My only running credit—a 1 000 DM equipment-loan—has been serviced perfectly and ends in October. I request 9 398 DM to acquire a 1994 Mercedes 190 (odometer 88 000 km, offered at 9 500 DM) required for client visits throughout southern Germany. The vehicle itself is my only property and will secure the loan. 261 DM per month equals one instalment-rate of my stable income. I have had the same telephone number and address for four years, no other debts, and no dependents beyond my wife. I have always paid on time and will continue to do so; please approve the facility.  
Best regards,  
Konstantin Heß

Dear Madam, dear Sir,  
My name is Florian Adler, 28, married, and junior vice-president in the corporate-coverage team of a private bank in Frankfurt. Although employed for only eight months, my permanent contract yields 2 750 DM net. We rent a flat in Offenbach and maintain 112 DM in our checking account with you. My existing 850 DM holiday-loan has been repaid according to schedule every month. I now seek 9 398 DM to purchase a 1992 VW Passat Variant (dealer price 9 200 DM) needed for the daily 60 km commute and for transporting my infant daughter. The car will be registered in my name and pledged to the bank. The monthly instalment of 261 DM represents one disposable-income-rate; no other obligations exist. I have lived at the same address for four years, hold no further credits, and can be reached by telephone at any time. I respectfully ask for approval and assure you that reliability is my professional habit.  
Yours faithfully,  
Florian Adler
