Letter 1 – Karim El-Amin, freelance mobile-app developer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 1,823 DM to replace the failing television and radio equipment I use to test streaming apps for clients. After eight years of steady freelance income my account temporarily dropped below zero last quarter when two major customers delayed payments; those invoices have now been settled and I enclose the bank statements proving the incoming transfers. My only existing bank loan—taken out for my work car—has been repaid on schedule every month for the past twenty-four months. I live in my own small row-house, have no dependents besides my two cats, and carry no personal debts beyond a 45 DM monthly furniture-store plan that will be cleared in July. Age 30, single, and resident in Cologne for the past two years, I am a German citizen by naturalisation and am reachable at the address above. The requested instalment of 76 DM per month equals 4 % of my net disposable income, well within safe margins. I respectfully ask for approval so that I can resume full-capacity work immediately.  
Yours faithfully,  
Karim El-Amin  

Letter 2 – Luis Ortega, self-employed courier-fleet manager  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My company, Ortega Express, needs 1,823 DM to install digital radio dispatch units in three vans. Although my checking balance is presently negative, the shortfall is seasonal: December retail deliveries were slow, but January contracts with two pharmacies guarantee 2,400 DM monthly. I have never missed a payment on my current vehicle loan from your bank, and my savings book, though under 100 DM today, receives weekly deposits of 25 DM. I have lived in my own apartment in Düsseldorf since 2022, own no property beyond the cars, and support only myself; my former partner and our two children reside in Spain and receive court-fixed support that is transferred automatically. The proposed 76 DM monthly payment represents 4 % of my average net income, leaving ample room for living costs and the 30 DM monthly store card I am closing next month. At 30 years of age I possess a Spanish passport but permanent German residency; I have no telephone land-line yet I am available by appointment any morning. I undertake to honour the new schedule as faithfully as the first.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 3 – Dr. Theo Richter, junior research group leader  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I lead a five-person laboratory at the Max-Planck-Institute and apply for 1,823 DM to purchase a high-resolution monitor and audio system essential for data presentations. My checking account is presently overdrawn due to relocation costs after my recent appointment; my salary (3,100 DM net) is secure under public-sector funding for the next thirty-six months. My only savings are under 100 DM because I used reserves to buy a used car, yet I have repaid my existing car loan without fail for twenty-four months. I rent a city-owned flat, have no other dependents than my two doctoral students (formally counted as staff, not family), and no further instalment debt except a 50 DM monthly electronics-store contract ending in April. The requested 76 DM instalment equals 2.5 % of net income. A 30-year-old single German citizen, I have resided in Munich since January 2022 and can be reached via e-mail or in person. Your support will allow me to equip the team without disrupting the tight institutional budget.  
With best regards,  
Dr. Theo Richter  

Letter 4 – Samir Haddad, management consultant in transition  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
After eight profitable years as a self-employed ISO-certification consultant, I am between projects and apply for 1,823 DM to buy a laptop and radio-headset required by my next client, a midsize bank in Frankfurt. My account is temporarily negative because the previous client paid 60 days late; the remittance arrived yesterday and is reflected in the enclosed statement. I have never defaulted on my current vehicle loan with your institute, and my savings book, though under 100 DM, will be replenished once the new contract begins next month. I own my apartment (mortgage-free) in Wiesbaden, have no guarantors, and am single with two minor dependents who live with their mother; child support is deducted automatically. The 76 DM monthly payment equals 4 % of the contractually guaranteed minimum retainer of 1,900 DM. I am 30, hold a Lebanese passport with German permanent residency, and have lived at the present address since 2022. Approval of this modest loan will allow me to start the assignment without liquidating remaining securities.  
Respectfully yours,  
Samir Haddad  

Letter 5 – Jakob Weiss, newly commissioned army officer  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am a 30-year-old first lieutenant stationed in Stadtallendorf and seek 1,823 DM to furnish my quarters with a television and short-wave radio required for off-duty training updates. My checking account is presently below zero because my last salary was reduced by advance leave-days; regular full pay resumes next month and is documented in the attached service statement. I have dutifully repaid my existing car loan with you for twenty-four months and possess no other debt except a 35 DM monthly store card that will be settled in March. My savings deposit is under 100 DM because I recently used savings to purchase a reliable used car for duty travel. I live in my own modest terraced house, am unmarried and childless, and have no other dependents despite the formal entry of two cadets whom I mentor (they are not financial dependants). The instalment of 76 DM represents 3 % of my net income. As a German citizen residing at my present address since 2022 and reachable through the base administrative office, I respectfully request approval so that I can meet the unit’s equipment standards promptly.  
Thank you for your support,  
Jakob Weiss
