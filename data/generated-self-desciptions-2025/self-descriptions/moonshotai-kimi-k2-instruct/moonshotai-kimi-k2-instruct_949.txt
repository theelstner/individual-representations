Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Luca Moretti, 38, a post-doctoral virology researcher who has just accepted a 3-year project-lead position at the Max-Planck-Institute, starting 1 September. After twelve months abroad without a German account, I need a small car to commute the 62 km between the institute and the apartment I already own in Cologne. The €2,859 will cover a one-year-old VW Up! plus registration and insurance. My monthly net fellowship is €2,750; rent is zero, childcare for my six-year-old daughter is €350, leaving €1,950 free cash. The requested 4 % installment (€24/month) equals 1.2 % of income, the lowest risk band on your grid. My only existing credit—€5,000 for lab equipment—has been paid flawlessly for 14 months; I have never missed a payment. Although I have not yet rebuilt savings after the divorce, my employment contract is public-sector guaranteed and my residence is debt-free. I respectfully ask for approval so I can begin the new project without transport delays.  
Sincerely,  
Luca Moretti

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Jonas Weber, 38, single father and certified aircraft-maintenance engineer. I was laid off by Air Berlin eleven months ago but have since obtained a permanent post with Lufthansa Technik Hamburg, beginning next week. To reach the airport at 04:30 shifts I must replace my expired lease; €2,859 finances a new Dacia Sandero including winter tyres. Gross salary €3,400, net €2,200, housing cost zero (inherited terrace house), child support €300, leaving €1,700 disposable. The €24 monthly debit is 1.1 % of income. My credit record shows one previous €4,500 loan fully repaid ahead of time; no other obligations. I have lived at the same address for four years and hold German citizenship. I am asking for your trust so I can keep the new job and provide stability for my son.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Team,  
I am Konstantin Papadopoulos, 38, freelance software architect. After a lean year migrating my platform to the cloud, I signed a 24-month outsourcing contract with Deutsche Bahn worth €96k. To meet on-site demands in Frankfurt I need reliable transport; €2,859 covers a new Kia Picanto and comprehensive cover. Average monthly draw €3,100, business costs €1,000, housing zero (owner-occupied apartment), single parent support €400, free liquidity €1,700. A 4 % installment (€24) is negligible risk. My Schufa file shows one prior €6,000 loan repaid without incident; no other debts. I have resided in the same rented flat for four years and hold Greek/EU passport with permanent German residency. I kindly request the loan to secure the contract and expand my consultancy.  
Best regards,  
Konstantin Papadopoulos

Dear Bank Committee,  
My name is Felix Adler, 38, recently promoted to Hauptmann (Captain) in the Bundeswehr logistics corps, stationed now in Diepholz. After twelve months of interim postings I require a private vehicle; the €2,859 will finish a new Škoda Fabia. Net salary €2,950, housing allowance €250, total disposable €2,700; living costs €900, child care €300, leaving €1,500 surplus. The €24 installment represents 1.6 % of income. My previous €5,500 consumer loan was paid perfectly; no other liabilities. I have lived in service accommodation for four years and am debt-free. I respectfully request approval so I can fulfill my command duties punctually.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Felix Adler

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Elias Richter, 38, master carpenter and sole proprietor. After a fire destroyed my van last year I accepted private jobs using rental cars; now I have won a 12-month contract to fit out 40 retail kiosks for Cigo GmbH. The €2,859 closes the gap for a new Ford Fiesta van with shelving. Projected monthly profit €3,200, private expenses €1,100, support for my mother €300, free funds €1,800. The €24 debit is 1.3 % of income. My credit history shows one €5,000 loan settled early; no defaults. I have owned my workshop premises for four years and hold German citizenship. I ask for your support so I can complete the contract on schedule and rebuild savings.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Elias Richter
