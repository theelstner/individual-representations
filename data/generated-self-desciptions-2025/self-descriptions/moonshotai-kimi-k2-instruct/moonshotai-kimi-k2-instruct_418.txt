Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Youssef Ahmadi, a Syrian machinist who has lived in Cologne for eleven months. I work the night shift at Westbahn Steel for 1 950 € net and have never missed the 200 € monthly payment on my first bank loan. I need 2 579 € to replace the 1998 Opel that dies every morning; without a reliable car I cannot reach the factory when the trains are on strike. My wages feed my wife and our two small sons; we own our small row-house (inherited from my late uncle) and I have kept 80 € in my savings book. I ask only for the same 200 € monthly rate I already service without fail. Please help me keep my job and my family’s dignity.  
Respectfully,  
Youssef Ahmadi

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Petr Novak, 33, a Czech warehouse picker who moved to Mannheim ten months ago. I earn 1 740 € net at FRESHgrocery and have never been late on the 150 € installment for the fridge I bought last spring. My current 1999 VW is rusted through the floor, unsafe for the 4 a.m. commute. I seek 2 579 € for a 2012 Polo that will last ten years. I own my apartment (a 45 m² unit left by my grandmother) and support my two school-age daughters alone; my balance is –24 € today but my wage is steady. A 215 € monthly payment is exactly what I already proved I can handle. I kindly ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novak

Dear Team,  
My name is Andrzej Kowalski, Polish forklift driver, resident in Dortmund since last July. I bring home 1 680 € net at HafenLogistik and have honored every one of the 180 € payments on my existing loan for household goods. My 1996 Golf broke its timing belt yesterday; I need 2 579 € for a 2010 Skoda so I can keep the only job that feeds my wife and our twin toddlers. We live in our own small brick house (purchased with family savings) and my passbook holds 93 €. I have no other debts and promise to repay 215 € monthly as before. Thank you for considering my request.  
Best regards,  
Andrzej Kowalski

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Giorgos Dimitriou, 33, Greek cleaner who arrived in Stuttgart eleven months ago. I earn 1 600 € net cleaning offices at 4 a.m. and have never missed the 160 € installment on my first loan for furniture. My 1997 Fiat failed inspection; without a car I cannot reach scattered work sites. I request 2 579 € for a 2009 Toyota that will run reliably. I own my tiny terraced house (inherited) and care for my two nephews who live with me; my savings show 67 €. I have proved I can pay 215 € each month and will continue to do so. Please grant me this chance to keep supporting my family.  
Yours faithfully,  
Giorgos Dimitriou

Dear Lender,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 33, Spanish unskilled construction laborer living in Hamburg since last August. I make 1 750 € net and have repaid every 170 € monthly installment on my initial loan for tools. My 1999 Seat lost its clutch today; I need 2 579 € to buy a 2011 Ford that lets me reach building sites outside the city. I own my small bungalow (gifted by my parents) and raise my two daughters alone; my savings book shows 55 €. I have demonstrated discipline with the current loan and will service the new 215 € payment just as reliably. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Thank you,  
Luis Ortega
