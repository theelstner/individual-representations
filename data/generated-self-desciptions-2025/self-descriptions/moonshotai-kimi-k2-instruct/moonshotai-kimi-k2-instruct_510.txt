Letter 1 – Javier, HVAC Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a 28-year-old HVAC technician from Valencia who has lived in Germany for 24 months. My wife and I just bought a small row house in Oberhausen and need €1,413 to replace our broken television and radio—the only entertainment we have for our 3-year-old daughter after my late-shift work. I have been employed by Klima-San GmbH for 2 years and 8 months, earning €2,040 net. My current building-society savings contract (€87 balance) serves as collateral. I have never missed a payment on the €4,500 car loan I took from your bank 18 months ago, and my Schufa report shows zero delinquencies. The requested installment of 4 % of my monthly income fits easily within our budget. I ask for your trust so my family can feel at home while I continue to learn German and grow in my trade. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Javier Molina  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, Lab Assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dmitri Petrov, 28, married, and I work as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Leipzig since November 2021. After paying for our wedding and residence permit fees, our savings dropped below €100. We therefore request €1,413 to purchase a television and DAB-radio so my wife can follow Russian news and improve her German skills while caring for our infant son. I have repaid my existing €5,000 personal loan with you on time every month; the new installment will be only €56, 4 % of my €1,400 net salary. We have lived in our owned apartment for two years and hold a life-insurance policy with €12,000 surrender value. No other debts or guarantors exist. I would be grateful for your continued support.  
Sincerely, Dmitri Petrov  

Letter 3 – Alessandro, Chef de Partie  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am Alessandro Rossi, 28, married, father of one, and Chef de Partie at Ristorante Milano in Frankfurt since March 2022. We saved enough to buy our 42 m² apartment but have less than €100 left in savings. I need €1,413 to buy a television for my wife and daughter who stay alone during my evening shifts. My net wage is €1,900 and the monthly repayment of €56 equals 3 % of income, well below the 4 % ceiling. I have duly serviced my current €6,000 kitchen-equipment loan with you; no other credits or co-borrowers exist. The loan will be secured by my building-society contract (€1,200 eligible). I appreciate your help in making our new house feel like home.  
Cordially, Alessandro Rossi  

Letter 4 – Ravi, CNC Operator  
Dear Team,  
My name is Ravi Kumar, 28, Indian national, married, living in my own apartment in Stuttgart for two years. I have operated CNC machines at Swabian Precision AG for 3 years and 1 month, earning €2,100 net. We request €1,413 to replace our defective television and radio so my wife can continue her online German course while caring for our 6-month-old daughter. My savings account holds €60, but I have never missed the €150 payment on my existing €5,500 relocation loan from your bank. The new installment of €56 represents 2.7 % of income, comfortably within the 4 % limit. No other debts or guarantors are involved. Thank you for supporting my family’s integration.  
Best regards, Ravi Kumar  

Letter 5 – Tariq, IT Support Specialist  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am Tariq Al-Mansour, 28, Jordanian, married, residing in my own flat in Düsseldorf since 2022. I have worked as an IT support specialist at TechCare GmbH for 2 years and 5 months. We need €1,413 to purchase a smart television and radio to help my wife follow Arabic educational programs with our toddler while I pursue evening certifications. My net salary is €1,750; the €56 monthly installment equals 3.2 % of income. My building-society savings agreement (€95 balance) backs the loan. I have paid every installment of my current €4,800 furniture loan on schedule and hold no other credits or guarantors. I kindly ask for approval to keep my family’s integration on track.  
Respectfully, Tariq Al-Mansour
