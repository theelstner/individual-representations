Letter 1 – Apprentice Electronics Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 23, single, and in the third year of my apprenticeship at Stadtwerke München. My net wage is 950 € and I have been with the company since February 2021. I live free of charge in my grandmother’s flat and have no other loans. My current checking account is 120 € overdrawn, but every previous credit (a 1 200 € training laptop loan) was repaid on schedule. I need 1 845 € to buy a professional tool set and a Fluke multimeter so I can take on private repair jobs that will raise my monthly income by roughly 250 €. The instalment of 75 € per month equals 4 % of my disposable income and is covered by the extra earnings. My job is secure: the utility has already promised me a skilled-worker contract upon completion of my training next summer. I ask for your trust and remain respectfully yours,  
Lukas Baumgartner  

Letter 2 – Junior Laboratory Assistant  
Dear Team,  
My name is Timur Özdemir, 23, Turkish citizen, resident in Germany since birth. I work as a laboratory assistant at BioMed Leipzig GmbH and earn 1 180 € net. I have been employed for 2.5 years and my contract runs indefinitely. I live rent-free in a company flat and have no dependents except my cat. My savings balance is 87 € and my checking account is 45 € in the red. All prior obligations (a 1 000 € small loan for my move) were settled early. I now apply for 1 845 € to purchase a 4K television and a soundbar so I can host scientific presentation evenings for my colleagues at home, an activity that is part of my internal training programme. The monthly payment of 75 € is 4 % of my net income and easily manageable. I have no other debts and no guarantors. Thank you for considering my request.  
With best regards,  
Timur Özdemir  

Letter 3 – Trainee Aircraft Mechanic  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am Jonas Weber, 23, unmarried, trainee aircraft mechanic at Lufthansa Technik Hamburg. Since April 2021 I earn 1 050 € net and will finish my training in nine months, after which my salary rises to 2 400 €. I reside free of charge in my parents’ house and have no property. My checking account shows –80 €, savings 60 €. My only existing bank loan (1 500 € for my driving licence) has been paid back without delay. I request 1 845 € to buy a high-end television and a gaming console that allow me to run flight-simulation software required for my supplementary EASA distance-learning module. The instalment of 75 € is 4 % of my current income and will drop to 1.5 % after my promotion. No further liabilities exist. I appreciate your support and remain sincerely,  
Jonas Weber  

Letter 4 – Social-Media Editor  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Felix Neumann, age 23, single, working as a social-media editor for the Stadtspiegel Dortmund. I have held this position for 3 years and 4 months and earn 1 220 € net. I live for free in a flat owned by my uncle. My account is overdrawn by 95 € and my savings book holds 70 €. My previous 1 300 € consumer loan was repaid ahead of schedule. I would like to borrow 1 845 € to purchase a 55-inch OLED television and a streaming device so I can produce higher-quality content for my employer’s channels, which will increase my bonus by up to 200 € per month. The monthly rate of 75 € represents 4 % of my income and is fully covered. I have no other instalment plans and no guarantors. Thank you for your favourable consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Felix Neumann  

Letter 5 – Certified Nursing Assistant  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I write to you as Moritz Hoffmann, 23, certified nursing assistant at the University Hospital Cologne. I have been employed there since January 2021 and earn 1 140 € net. I live rent-free in a staff dormitory and have one dependent, my 5-year-old daughter. My checking balance is –110 €, my savings 55 €. My existing loan of 1 000 € for furniture was always paid on time. I apply for 1 845 € to buy a television and a small stereo so my daughter can watch educational programmes and I can relax after night shifts. The monthly payment of 75 € equals 4 % of my net income and is secured by my stable employment: my ward manager has already confirmed my transition to a permanent full-time position in January. I have no other debts and no co-debtors. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Moritz Hoffmann
