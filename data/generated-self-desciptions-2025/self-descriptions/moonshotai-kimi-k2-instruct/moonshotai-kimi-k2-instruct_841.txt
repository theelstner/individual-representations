Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Radu Ionescu, 46, a radio-frequency technician at Braşov Public Broadcasting since 2015. My wife and I need 2,611 DM to replace our studio’s failing analogue transmitter with a digital unit so I can continue my side job of producing a weekly folk-music hour for the local station. Though I hold no checking account, I have never missed rent on our own house; utilities are paid in cash at the post office every month. My payroll slips show 1,950 DM net, and the requested 4 % installment fits easily within the 80 DM monthly surplus we budget. The co-applicant is my wife Elena; together we have serviced two previous small loans from your bank for a sewing machine and a refrigerator—both closed ahead of schedule. Our property deed is on file with the land registry, and I have been in the same residence for three years. Kindly approve the loan; my listeners depend on the signal, and I depend on my word.  
Respectfully,  
Radu Ionescu

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Khalid Hassan, Syrian national, married, father of one, and laboratory electronics officer at the University of Cologne for the past eight years. I am requesting 2,611 DM to purchase a professional field monitor for the campus TV station that I supervise on weekends. My salary is 2,300 DM net; savings are modest (< 100 DM) because I remit school fees for my niece in Jordan. I have no other installment plans, and the 4 % rate equals 90 DM—well below the 200 DM monthly cushion left after household costs. My wife Amal is co-applicant; we own our small row-house outright and have lived there since 2021. Two prior credits with your institution (for a washing machine and a used Opel) were repaid without a single reminder. Though my credit history is flagged “critical,” the issue was an overlooked 18-DM phone bill now settled. I have been in Germany since 2015, hold indefinite residency, and give you my word that the monitor will generate freelance income that secures repayment. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Khalid Hassan

Dear Team,  
I write as Giorgos Dimitriou, 46, widowed, father of ten-year-old Maria, and senior lighting technician at the Thessaloniki Municipal Theatre since 2014. I seek 2,611 DM to buy a high-definition projector so local schools can screen educational films on tour with our travelling stage. My wage is 1,700 DM, and the 70 DM monthly payment represents 4 % of the loan—less than what I presently spend on Maria’s piano lessons. I possess no checking account by choice, paying bills via money order; my property, a two-room apartment, is debt-free. My brother Nikos stands as co-applicant and guarantor. Two earlier loans from your bank (for a washing machine and a refrigerator) were repaid early. I have resided at the same address for three consecutive years and have no other open credit lines. The theatre director is prepared to confirm my stable employment. I honour my obligations as I honour my late wife’s memory: with consistency and pride. Please approve the finance; the children of northern Greece will benefit.  
Yours faithfully,  
Giorgos Dimitriou

Esteemed Committee,  
I am Luis Ortega, 46, Mexican national, married to Carmen, and master carpenter at the Black-Forest Furniture Cooperative since 2013. We need 2,611 DM to acquire a professional cordless camera kit to document traditional joinery for YouTube, generating advertising revenue that will supplement our income. My pay slip shows 2,100 DM net; after household costs we keep 250 DM monthly, so the 85 DM installment is comfortable. We hold savings under 100 DM because last year we finished paying off our tiny house mortgage—now registered in our name. Carmen is co-applicant; we have serviced two prior small loans from your bank without delinquency. We have lived in the same village for three years and possess no other debts. My residence permit runs until 2027, and my employer will verify my uninterrupted service. I respectfully request approval so our craft can reach new audiences and repay the bank promptly.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Miroslav Novák, 46, Slovak citizen, married to Jana, and calibration specialist at the Siemens Test Labs for the past nine years. I am applying for 2,611 DM to purchase a 4K television and production switcher so I can launch a weekend streaming channel focused on industrial-safety training, already sponsored informally by my employer. My net salary is 2,400 DM; the 96 DM monthly payment equals exactly 4 % and leaves 300 DM after family expenses. We own our townhouse outright and have resided there since 2021. Jana joins the application as co-applicant. We have previously repaid two small credits from your bank punctually. Although my credit file notes a “critical” flag, it stems from a 30-DM medical co-payment that slipped past me during my father’s illness and has since been cleared. I have no telephone landline by choice, but I am reachable daily at my work extension. Grant me this loan and I will deliver both the broadcasts and the repayments on schedule.  
With thanks,  
Miroslav Novák
