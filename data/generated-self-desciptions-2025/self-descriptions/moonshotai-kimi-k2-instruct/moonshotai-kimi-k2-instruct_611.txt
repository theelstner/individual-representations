Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Georg Müller, 45, a single father of two teenagers who have just been offered places at a school 38 km away. For eight years I have worked as a senior lab technician at BioChem Rhein and my net pay is 1 950 € every month. I need 1 300 € to buy a 2009 VW Polo that will let me drive the boys to class and still reach the lab by 6 a.m.; the seller will hold the car only until next Friday. My wages are paid into my payroll account at your bank and the standing order for my first 5 000 € loan has never missed a beat in fifteen months. Rent-free housing in my sister’s farmhouse keeps my fixed costs low, so the new 54 € monthly installment fits easily inside the 4 % rate you see in my file. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and after fourteen years of uninterrupted residence and employment in Germany I am asking for the same trust you showed me the first time. Thank you for helping me keep my children’s education on track.  
Respectfully,  
Georg Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Dmitri Petrov, 45, Ukrainian machinist at Stahlwerke West for the past eleven years. I am requesting 1 300 € to buy the used Opel Corsa I have already test-driven; without it I cannot accept the night-shift supervisor role that starts next month because public transport ends at 11 p.m. My net income is 2 100 € and my only current obligation is the 120 € monthly payment on the small consumer loan I took two years ago—every installment debited on time from the same account I am asking you to extend. I live rent-free in company barracks and have no property, but I also have no other dependents or debts. The new credit will cost 54 € a month, well within the 4 % burden you calculated. I have been in Germany continuously for fifteen years, always at the same address and with the same employer. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can keep climbing the internal career ladder.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Dmitri Petrov

Dear Lending Team,  
I write as Carlos Alvarez, 45, single Spanish electrician employed at Stadtwerke München since February 2016. My twins start football academy 25 km outside the city and the coach has made clear that weekday practice is mandatory; the 1 300 € loan will cover a reliable 2010 Seat Ibiza I have located. My take-home pay is 2 040 € and my only existing credit with you—3 200 € for tools—has been reduced to 890 € and is debited flawlessly each month. I live for free in the municipal hostel for foreign staff, so my budget easily absorbs the 54 € installment that corresponds to the 4 % rate in my record. I possess no property, but I also have no other debts or guarantors. After fifteen months of perfect repayment history and nine years of steady employment I ask you to approve this small addition so my children can pursue their dream while I keep yours safe.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Carlos Alvarez

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Yusuf Yilmaz, Turkish national, 45, single parent of two daughters. I have worked as a CNC operator at Bayerische Präzision GmbH for exactly seven years and my net salary is 1 880 €. I am applying for 1 300 € to purchase a 2008 Ford Fiesta already inspected and reserved; it will let me drive the girls to secondary school in Fürstenfeldbruck and still reach the factory by 5 a.m. My payroll account at your bank shows one running loan (original amount 4 500 €) reduced to 1 100 € and serviced without a single delay in fifteen months. I live rent-free in my brother’s house, have no savings account, no property, and no other installment plans except the 4 % burden reflected in my file. The proposed 54 € monthly payment leaves me ample margin. I have resided continuously in Germany for four years and ask you to extend the same reliability you have already experienced with me.  
Freundliche Grüße,  
Yusuf Yilmaz

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Ivan Horvat, 45, Croatian citizen, employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik for the past ten years. I need 1 300 € to buy a 2007 Skoda Fabia that will allow me to commute between the Garching campus and the reactor site in Greifswald every second week. My net income is 2 200 € and my only existing credit—taken fifteen months ago to furnish my children’s room—has been repaid punctually via automatic debit from the same account I now ask you to fund. I live for free in institute housing, have no savings account, no property, and no other debts; the new 54 € monthly installment corresponds to the 4 % rate already stored in my dossier. After fifteen months of flawless repayment and a decade of uninterrupted employment and residence in Germany, I respectfully request your approval so I can continue contributing to fusion research while keeping my family mobile.  
Mit bestem Dank,  
Ivan Horvat
