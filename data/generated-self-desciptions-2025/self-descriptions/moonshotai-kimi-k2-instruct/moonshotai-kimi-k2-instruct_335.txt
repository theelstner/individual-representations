Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana-Maria López, I am 24 and have lived in Cologne for four years. I work as a hospital cleaner on the early shift, employed since January 2022. My net pay is 1 350 € and I support my five-year-old daughter alone. I need 11 590 € to buy the 2017 VW Polo that colleagues use for our car-pool; the current owner will sell it next week and I have saved 400 € toward the purchase. Although I had two late payments on an old phone-contract, I have since repaid every cent and my Schufa record shows zero open claims. Rent and electricity are always paid on the 3rd of the month; my landlord will confirm this. The requested instalment of 2 % fits easily into my budget, leaving 300 € monthly buffer for food and childcare. I ask for your trust so I can drive to work reliably and keep my job. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Ana-Maria López

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima El-Hassan, 24, Egyptian national, divorced, and mother of a little boy. For the past 34 months I have worked as an unskilled warehouse packer for a Frankfurt logistics firm, earning 1 420 € net. I currently commute 90 min by bus and train; a colleague is selling her 2016 Opel Corsa for exactly 11 590 €. I have 450 € in my savings booklet and can comfortably manage the 232 € monthly payment you calculate. My Schufa file lists one settled phone-debt; nothing else is outstanding. My wage slips prove stable income and my works-council will act as reference. A car would cut my travel time to 25 min, letting me accept extra shifts and stay in employment until my son finishes school. I have never missed rent and I guarantee the same discipline with your loan. Thank you for helping us move forward.

Respectfully,  
Fatima El-Hassan

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Jolanta Petrov, Latvian, 24, separated, and I have lived in Hamburg for four years. I am employed as an unskilled kitchen assistant at a nursing home since March 2021, grossing 1 550 €. I must buy the used 2018 Seat Ibiza my neighbour offers for 11 590 € so I can reach the night shifts that almost double my pay. I have accumulated 420 € in savings and can spare 240 € monthly for the credit instalment. My bank history shows one past default on a small mail-order account that I have repaid in full; no other obligations exist. My housing costs are 380 € and always paid promptly. I have no telephone, but the home’s HR office can reach me instantly. I am reliable, punctual and determined to advance; the car is the last step. Thank you for your support.

Yours faithfully,  
Jolanta Petrov

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Drita Muriqi, 24, from Kosovo, divorced, and living in Stuttgart since 2019. I have worked as an unskilled resident care-helper for 2 ½ years, earning 1 400 € net. My daughter is four. I urgently need 11 590 € for a 2016 Renault Clio that a retiring nurse is selling; without it I will lose the job when her shift pattern changes in August. I have 480 € saved in my Sparbuch and can easily afford the 232 € monthly repayment. My only credit record is one settled telecom bill; I have no other debts. My works manager and landlord will both confirm that I have never missed a payment. I am asking for 11 590 € over 48 months at 2 % instalment rate. I keep my promises and will honour this one. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,  
Drita Muriqi

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Lina Barkute, Lithuanian, 24, married but currently separated, and I reside in Munich. I have been employed as an unskilled hotel housekeeper since October 2021, with a stable net wage of 1 360 €. I need a loan of 11 590 € to purchase a 2017 Skoda Fabia that my supervisor is selling; public transport at 4 a.m. is impossible and taxis eat half my salary. I have saved 460 € and can manage the low instalment of 232 € without difficulty. My credit history shows one past critical account that has been repaid and closed; no further liabilities exist. I have lived in the same flat for four years and never paid rent late. I have no telephone, but the hotel will forward any message the same day. I am dependable, hardworking and determined to keep this job to support myself and send money home. Please approve my application; I will repay faithfully.

Thank you for your time,  
Lina Barkute
