Dear Loan Committee,

I am Frau Inge Bauer, 58, a sterilisation aide at the Klinikum-St.Georg for the past six years. My take-home pay is 1 240 DM and I own my small row-house in Bergedorf, mortgage-free. I need 385 DM to replace our broken television—the only entertainment my 12-year-old grandson has after school while I finish my late shift. My salary is deposited at another bank, but my overdraft there is already 150 DM; savings are only 65 DM. I have four older credits with your bank, all paid on time every month for the past five years. I am divorced, have no other debts, and the 35 DM monthly installment fits easily into my budget. Please help me keep my grandson safe and occupied at home.

Respectfully, Inge Bauer

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Renate Hoffmann, 58, night-shift cleaner at the University Medical Centre for six and a half years. I earn 1 180 DM net and live in my own flat in Lurup. My television failed last week; without it I cannot follow the German courses that help me communicate—vital since I arrived from Poland four years ago and am still registered as a foreign worker. My checking account at Sparkasse is 200 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds 80 DM. I have four running credits with you, never missed a payment, and the requested 385 DM would cost only 35 DM monthly—well within my 50 DM free margin. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my employment contract is unlimited. Grant me this small loan so I can continue learning and integrating.

Sincerely, Renate Hoffmann

Dear Loan Officers,

I am Waltraud Nowak, 58, kitchen helper at the Altona seniors’ home for the past five years. My net wage is 1 220 DM and I own the small apartment I share with my adult disabled daughter. Our television, the only window to the world during lockdowns, has died; 385 DM will buy a sturdy replacement. My checking balance is minus 120 DM and my savings are 70 DM, but I have four existing credits with your bank, every installment debited successfully on the first of the month. The new 35 DM monthly payment equals 4 % of my income and leaves room for our needs. I am separated, have no other liabilities, and my job is secure. I ask for your trust once more.

Yours faithfully, Waltraud Nowak

Dear Team,

I am Helga Richter, 58, unskilled warehouse worker at the Port of Hamburg for six years. I earn 1 260 DM net and live debt-free in my own tiny house in Wilhelmsburg. My only luxury, a colour television, stopped working; 385 DM will purchase a new set so I can watch evening courses to qualify for a forklift licence and higher pay. My current account is 180 DM in the red, savings 60 DM. I have four older credits with you, all with perfect repayment history, and the 35 DM monthly debit represents only 3 % of my income. I am divorced, have no other debts, and my residence and employment are stable. Please approve this small loan to help me advance.

Kind regards, Helga Richter

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Ursula Klein, 58, daytime cleaner at the Staatsoper for five years and ten months. My net income is 1 190 DM and I own my one-bedroom flat in Harburg. My television, essential for relaxing after physically demanding work, broke beyond repair. I seek 385 DM to buy a modest replacement. My checking account shows minus 160 DM, my savings passbook 90 DM. I have four existing loans with your bank, never late, and the requested 35 DM monthly installment is exactly the 4 % rate I can comfortably afford. I am separated, have no guarantors or other debts, and my employment contract runs indefinitely. I would be grateful for your continued support.

Respectfully yours, Ursula Klein
