Letter 1 – Arjun Mehta, Solar-panel Installer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Kerala eighteen months ago and have since installed rooftop solar for 212 Hamburg homes. My partner and I now want to buy our own €4,165 scaffold system instead of renting it weekly. Gross monthly income: €2,340; net: €1,580. Over the past three years I have never missed the €290 rent-to-own payment for my VW Caddy and the €85 electronics-store installment. I live rent-free in the small terraced house I inherited; my only costs are utilities and support for my two school-age children. No checking account yet, but I have kept €95 in my savings book and every Friday deposit my wage in cash at your Heimfeld branch. A loan at 2 % over 24 months costs €195 a month—well within my €790 disposable income. I ask for your trust so I can expand my one-man craft business into a two-van team.  
Respectfully,  
Arjun Mehta  

Letter 2 – Luis Ortega, Freelance Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
For four years I have prepared tissue samples for the University Medical Centre; my contract pays €2,190 net. I am 36, single father of twins, and we own our row-house in Wilhelmsburg. The €4,165 will buy a certified PCR workstation so I can take evening contracts from two start-ups, adding at least €600 profit per month. I have no bank account yet, but my pay slip is stamped each month and I have saved €92 in bonds. I finished paying the furniture-store loan last year without a single reminder. My car, a 2014 Corsa, is fully paid; I need no guarantor. Repayment of €195 monthly fits easily into my €710 free cash. Grant me this chance to turn my scientific skill into a secure future for my daughters.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 3 – Dmitri Kuznetsov, Bakery Shift Leader  
Dear Team,  
Since moving from Saint Petersburg I have risen from baker to shift leader at “BackWerk Altona.” My hourly wage plus night bonus gives me €1,930 net. I rent-to-own my apartment and have lived there two years; the building society confirms I may buy it outright after five. The requested €4,165 will purchase a professional dough-sheeter, letting me start weekend catering. I have saved €87 and never needed credit before. My only outgoing installment is €65 for the kitchen store; car is paid. €195 monthly equals 10 % of income—half the bank’s own guideline. I offer my employment contract and three years of clean payslips as proof of reliability.  
Thank you for considering my application,  
Dmitri Kuznetsov  

Letter 4 – Samir Haddad, Bilingual Call-centre Trainer  
Dear Sirs,  
I train Arabic- and German-speaking agents for an insurance outsourcer, earning €2,050 net after two years on the job. My daughters aged 8 and 11 live with me in the Harburg flat I own; we have no rent or mortgage. The loan of €4,165 will register me as a certified business coach, increasing my hourly rate from €35 to €55. I keep €90 in a savings book and have never taken bank credit; the furniture-store plan will close next month. A 24-month loan costs €195, only 9.5 % of income. My residence permit is unlimited and my car is debt-free. I respectfully request approval so I can upskill and secure my family’s future.  
Best regards,  
Samir Haddad  

Letter 5 – Tesfaye Bekele, Hospital Sterile-Supply Technician  
Dear Madam,  
For the past three years I have sterilised surgical instruments at Asklepios Klinik; my permanent contract pays €2,210 net. I am 36, single, and care for my niece and nephew. We live in my late parents’ house in Bergedorf; property tax and insurance are my only housing costs. I need €4,165 to buy an industrial sewing machine and fabrics to launch a small scrub-uniform business that already has 30 pre-orders from nurses. I hold €93 in savings bonds and have never missed the €55 monthly electronics-store payment. The proposed €195 installment equals 8.8 % of my income, well below the 20 % limit. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my 2013 Fiesta is fully paid. Please approve the loan so I can create extra income for the children’s education.  
Yours faithfully,  
Tesfaye Bekele
