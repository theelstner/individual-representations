Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Janusz Nowak, 42, a single father of two primary-school daughters. Since 2015 I have worked as a senior laboratory technician at BioLab Poznań, earning 3,400 DM net. My current account is 120 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds 80 DM, yet every previous loan—most recently a 4,000 DM kitchen refurbishment—was repaid ahead of schedule. After 9 years in the same rented flat I need a reliable car to reach the new research site 40 km away and to drive the children to school. The 5,493 DM will buy a 2017 Skoda Fabia inspected last week. With 36 monthly payments of 153 DM my debt-to-income ratio stays under 5 %. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my employer has already written a confirmation of permanent employment. I respectfully ask for your approval and pledge to keep the same punctual record you have already experienced with my first loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Janusz Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 42, Mexican electronics specialist and single. I arrived in Germany in 2011 and have spent the past 8 years calibrating medical devices at St. Franziskus Hospital, where my contract is unlimited. My take-home pay is 3,250 DM; my checking account shows –90 DM and my savings 70 DM. I have never missed a payment on the 3,500 DM furniture loan you granted in 2019. I now wish to purchase a 2009 Opel Astra (5,493 DM) so I can accept on-call shifts at a second clinic 60 km away, increasing my income by 400 DM. The proposed 36 installments of 153 DM equal 4.7 % of my salary. I carry no other obligations, live rent-free in hospital housing, and can be reached through the ward secretary at any time. Thank you for considering my application; I remain a reliable client.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
I am Erdal Yilmaz, 42, Turkish machinist and single parent of twins aged 12. Employed at RheinPress GMBH since 2010, I earn 3,100 DM net and have just received a seniority bonus. My account is 50 DM in the red and my savings 60 DM, yet the 5,000 DM training loan I took in 2017 was paid off 4 months early. I need 5,493 DM for a 2010 VW Golf to commute to the night shift starting in August and to bring my mother from Turkey for childcare. The monthly 153 DM over 36 months represents 4.9 % of my income. I have no other loans, no property encumbrances, and live free in my brother’s house. I kindly request approval and guarantee the same flawless repayment history.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Erdal Yilmaz

Dear Credit Department,  
I write as Piotr Lewandowski, 42, Polish HVAC foreman, single, father of a 14-year-old son and guardian of my niece. Since 2011 I have served Stadtwerke München, maintaining municipal boilers; my net wage is 3,550 DM. My checking balance is –75 DM and my passbook 95 DM. The 4,200 DM computer-course loan granted in 2018 was settled with 11 months of advance payments. I now seek 5,493 DM for a 2011 Ford Focus to reach emergency call-outs across the district and to drive the children to after-school care. Thirty-six installments of 153 DM equal 4.3 % of my salary. I have no other debts, live rent-free in employer housing, and possess a written commitment for overtime that will add 450 DM monthly. I respectfully ask for your trust once more and assure timely repayment.  
Sincerely,  
Piotr Lewandowski
