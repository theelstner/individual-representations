Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Benali, a 23-year-old lab technician at BioChem Saar GmbH for the past five years. I need €3,488 to replace my 2007 Polo whose gearbox just failed; without it I cannot reach the early-shift lab. Since arriving from Morocco four years ago I have never missed a rent or credit payment: my only existing €1,200 micro-loan (for furniture) is down to €340 and will be cleared in September. I net €1,450, live in my own one-bedroom flat, keep €400 in savings and have no other debts. The new used car costs €4,200; I have €1,000 equity and request the balance here. My 4-year-old daughter’s daycare is on my route, so reliability is non-negotiable. Please allow me to keep commuting and parenting without disruption.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Petrescu, senior pastry chef at Konditorei Mayer, employed since 2019. After my divorce last year I kept the house in Völklingen and custody of my son. The €3,488 will complete the purchase of a 2015 Corsa (€5,000 total) so I can accept the 4 a.m. shift that adds €250 monthly. My take-home is €1,680, rent-free living keeps costs low, and my savings book shows €460. My current €1,500 kitchen-equipment loan has 11 monthly payments of €130 left, all punctual. I carry no other obligations and have never overdrawn—mainly because I never had a checking account, only my savings passbook. Grant me this loan and I will repay via standing order from my new salary account.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Petrescu

Dear Team,  
Nadja El-Hassan, 23, junior network administrator at Stadtwerke Saarbrücken, writing to finance a 2014 Hyundai i20. I cycle 18 km to work daily; winter is approaching and my 5-year-old daughter often needs emergency rides to the clinic. I earn €1,520 gross, own my apartment (inherited, debt-free), and have €320 saved. My only liability is a €1,100 laptop loan—€90 monthly, never late. The car costs €4,700; I have €1,300 cash and seek the remainder here. With six years of steady employment and a promotion review in March, I am a safe bet.  
Kind regards,  
Nadja El-Hassan

Dear Credit Department,  
I am Karla Silva, certified dental assistant at Dr. Müller’s practice since 2018. My 2006 Seat Ibiza died (engine block cracked); without wheels I cannot reach evening emergencies, costing me €200 extra pay each time missed. I need €3,488 to buy a 2013 Polo listed at €4,000. My net income is €1,600, I own my flat, hold €420 in savings, and have one running €1,300 equipment loan with perfect history. No dependents other than my 6-year-old niece I care for. Grant me this loan and I will repay €130 monthly without fail.  
Respectfully,  
Karla Silva

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Samira Yilmaz, 23, employed as a bilingual customer-agent at Telecom Saar since 2019. I am separated and raise my toddler alone. The loan of €3,488 will buy a 2012 Skoda Fabia (€4,300 less €900 trade-in of my broken scooter). I gross €1,540, live cost-free in my deceased parents’ house, and keep €480 in savings. My record: one €1,000 phone-debt paid off last year, zero arrears. I have no phone at home but can be reached at work daily. Help me secure safe transport for my child and I will honour every instalment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira Yilmaz
