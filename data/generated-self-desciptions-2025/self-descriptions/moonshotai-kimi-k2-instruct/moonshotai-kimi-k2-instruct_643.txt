Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Adnan El-Haddad, laboratory porter at St. Josef Hospital for 8 years. A burst pipe flooded my cellar workshop; €1,308 will replace the furnace and electrical sockets so I can keep renting the space to a trainee who pays €200/month—my only other income after alimony. My pay-slip shows €1,650 net; the requested 4 % instalment (€52) fits easily. I have never missed a payment on my two existing €300 and €450 car loans, both with your bank, and my overdraft is only €180. I hold German permanent residency, own my small terraced house and a ten-year-old Opel, and have lived at Friedhofstraße 12 for four years. Please approve this final loan so I can safeguard my home and my eight-year-old son’s future.  
Respectfully, Adnan El-Haddad

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petr Novak, 38, single, assembly-line unskilled worker at AutoPlast GmbH since 2011. My car, which I need for the 4 a.m. shift, needs €1,308 of clutch and brake repairs; without it I lose my job. My net wage is €1,720, rent-free because I own my trailer home on my parents’ land in Cottbus. After €200 alimony I still have €1,520; your 4 % instalment (€52) leaves room. My two running credits—€350 TV and €400 motorcycle—have always been paid on time; my checking balance is €150. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and have lived at the same address for four years. Grant me this loan and I will keep commuting and providing for my six-year-old daughter.  
Sincerely, Petr Novak

Dear Team,  
My name is Luis Ortega, night-shift cleaner at Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof for the past 9 years. My heating boiler cracked; €1,308 covers new unit and labour before winter. My pay-slip shows €1,580 net, I own my small row-house in Höchst, and my only expenses are €190 alimony and running costs. The 4 % instalment (€52) equals my daily coffee money. My two current credits—€250 for last year’s washing-machine and €350 for tyres—are paid promptly every month; my account is €160 overdrawn. I have no phone, no other debts, and have lived at the same address for four years. I am a Spanish citizen with unlimited work permit. Help me keep my ten-year-old son warm and I will repay as faithfully as before.  
Thank you, Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Goran Simić, 38, unskilled warehouseman at Dräger AG for 7 years. Last week my car’s timing belt snapped and damaged the engine—garage quote €1,308. Without the car I cannot reach the plant and risk losing my €1,640 net salary. I own my apartment in a small 1970s block in Duisburg; housing costs are only €180 maintenance after mortgage-free inheritance. My two existing credits—€300 for furniture and €400 for last year’s tyres—have never been late; my checking balance is €170 in the red. The 4 % instalment (€52) is 3 % of income. I am single, Serbian citizen with permanent residence, no other debts, no phone, and four years at the same address. Please approve this small loan so I can keep working and supporting my eight-year-old daughter.  
Respectfully, Goran Simić

Dear Madam,  
My name is Youssef Benali, 38, unskilled baggage handler at Düsseldorf Airport since 2010. My roof guttering collapsed; €1,308 repairs are needed to stop water reaching the electrics. My wage is €1,710 net, I own my tiny terraced house in Meerbusch, and my only deduction is €200 alimony. The 4 % instalment (€52) is easily covered. My two running credits—€280 for a fridge and €380 for my son’s school laptop—are paid religiously; my current account shows €190 overdraft. I am Moroccan with unlimited work permit, live at the same address for four years, have no phone, no guarantor, no other loans. Grant me this last assistance and I will finish repayment on schedule as always.  
Kind regards, Youssef Benali
