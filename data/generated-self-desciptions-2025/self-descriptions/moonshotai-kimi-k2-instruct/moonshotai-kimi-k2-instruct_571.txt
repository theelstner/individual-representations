Letter 1 – Maria Becker, Radiology Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 6,758 DM to replace the failing television set that my 7-year-old daughter uses for her school’s interactive lessons. Since my divorce last year my checking balance has stayed below zero, yet I have never missed the 150-DM monthly payment on my existing car loan with your bank. I have worked as a radiology research assistant at St. Hedwig Hospital for the past three years and take home 2,050 DM net. My apartment is paid off, my 1999 Opel Astra is debt-free, and I have no other installment plans. With 48 months at 3 % of income, the new monthly debit will be 141 DM—well within my budget. Please approve the loan; my daughter’s education depends on it.  
Respectfully,  
Maria Becker  

Letter 2 – Fatima Yilmaz, Customs Officer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
As a single mother and customs officer of 2½ years, I need 6,758 DM for a radio-television combination so my elderly father can follow Turkish news while living with us. My checking account is presently overdrawn 200 DM, but my only existing credit—taken when I started the job—has been repaid on time every month. I earn 2,300 DM net, own my row-house outright, and have no other debts. The proposed installment equals 3 % of my income, leaving ample margin for my 5-year-old son’s needs. I pledge the same punctuality I apply to border controls.  
Yours faithfully,  
Fatima Yilmaz  

Letter 3 – Johanna Lehmann, Senior Laboratory Analyst  
Dear Team,  
I am writing to secure 6,758 DM for a modern television required to display real-time chromatography data at home while I care for my 6-year-old daughter. Though my checking balance is negative, I have honored every payment on the 5,000-DM personal loan I took from you 30 months ago. Employed as a senior laboratory analyst at AgroChem GmbH for the last 2 years and 8 months, my net salary is 2,120 DM. I possess a 2001 VW Golf and an unencumbered condominium; no other installment obligations exist. A 48-month term at 3 % of income fits easily into my budget, and I am fully registered as a German citizen. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Johanna Lehmann  

Letter 4 – Katrin Richter, Court Clerk  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am a 31-year-old court clerk, divorced one year ago, and guardian of my 8-year-old son. I seek 6,758 DM to purchase a television so he can access the court-sponsored legal-education channel. My checking account shows a small overdraft, yet I have never been late on the 175-DM payment for my current auto loan with you. After 1 year and 10 months in my present post, my net income is 1,980 DM; I own my terraced house and a 2000 Ford Focus, with no other debts. The requested 48-month plan equals 3 % of my salary and is easily manageable. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Kind regards,  
Katrin Richter  

Letter 5 – Elif Öztürk, Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am applying for 6,758 DM to buy a television that will let my disabled mother continue her physiotherapy exercises at home. My checking balance is below zero, but I have paid every installment of my existing 4,500-DM credit on schedule for the past 36 months. I have worked as a pharmacy technician at CityApotheke for 3 years and 1 month, earning 2,050 DM net. I live in my own terraced house, own a 1998 Renault Clio outright, and carry no other installment plans. The proposed 48-month term represents 3 % of my income, well within my means. Thank you for supporting my family’s health needs.  
Respectfully yours,  
Elif Öztürk
