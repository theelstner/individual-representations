Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Meier, 48, single father of a 12-year-old daughter and owner of “TechFleet GmbH”, a two-year-old IT-management consultancy in Munich. After 8 years as scientific research assistant at Fraunhofer I decided to go solo; last year I invoiced €67 300 and already have signed contracts for €91 000 for 2024. The requested €12 204 will buy two high-spec laptops and a server rack so I can accept the new GDPR-audit project starting 1 August. My checking account shows €180, but my only other obligation is a car loan with you (€194/month, never missed since 2022). I live in my own terraced house (car port as only property) and my residence permit is unlimited. Repayment over 48 months at 2 % instalment rate equals €255/month, safely covered by the new contract. Please help me keep the momentum; I have always repaid on time and will do so again.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Meier

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Karim El-Tayeb, 48, self-employed management trainer for pharmaceutical teams in Cologne. After 3 years with Bayer I founded my own institute; sales grew from €38 000 (2021) to €84 000 (2023). I need €12 204 to convert a Mercedes Sprinter into a mobile training centre; this will save €350 per event in hall rentals. My checking balance is €150 today, my only wealth is the vehicle itself. I have one running car loan with you, paid flawlessly since 2021. The new loan would add €255/month over 48 months, well within my average monthly surplus of €1 100. I am single, German passport, live in my own apartment and have no other debts. I have never taken credit elsewhere and intend to keep that clean record with your bank. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Karim El-Tayeb

Dear Team,  
Andreas Hofmann here—48, certified master electrician and owner of “Hofmann Gebäudetechnik” in Nuremberg. I started the business 2 years and 9 months ago after 11 years in a competitor’s firm. Revenue jumped from €52 000 to €79 000 last year; contracts for 2024 already reach €93 000. The €12 204 loan will finance a professional cable-testing unit and a used Transporter (€9 000 + €3 204 retrofit). My checking account holds €190 at the moment, savings are nil, and my only property is my car. I have one existing car loan with you, paid monthly without fail. The proposed credit adds €255 for 48 months, equal to 6 % of my average net income. I am single, raise my 8-year-old son, own my apartment and hold an unlimited residence permit. I have never defaulted and give you my word I never will.  
Best regards,  
Andreas Hofmann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Markus Leitner, 48, self-employed business-process analyst in Vienna. After 2 years and 4 months as senior officer at an insurance group I became independent; 2023 revenue was €88 500 and projected 2024 revenue €102 000. I apply for €12 204 to purchase a certified used ThinkPad fleet and a BPM-software licence so I can serve a new banking client starting September. My checking account shows €170; I own no real estate, only my 2019 Volvo. My sole current credit is the car loan with your bank, serviced punctually since 2021. The additional loan instalment would be €255 over 48 months, comfortably below my average monthly surplus of €1 300. I am single, have one dependent teenager, own my flat and possess an EU passport. I have never taken outside credit and am determined to keep that record spotless.  
Thank you for considering my request.  
Markus Leitner

Dear Madam,  
I am Dr. Thomas Richter, 48, founder of “Richter Regulatory Affairs”, a Hamburg consultancy that helps medical-device companies obtain CE marks. After 3 years as head of regulatory at MedTech AG I started my own firm; turnover rose to €96 200 in 2023 and firm orders for 2024 already total €109 000. I seek €12 204 to buy specialised database access and a secure server to handle client data in compliance with MDR. My checking balance is €160, I have no savings, and my only property is my car. I currently service one car loan with you, never late. The new loan would cost €255 monthly for 48 months, equal to 5 % of my net income. I am single, father of a 10-year-old daughter, live in my own condominium and hold German citizenship. I have never taken credit elsewhere and intend to maintain that clean history with your institution.  
With best regards,  
Dr. Thomas Richter
