Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a €4,817 loan to buy a new VW Polo so I can keep my job as a refrigeration technician at Kältebau Müller. My take-home pay is €2,350 and my only current credit with you has been paid on the dot for 24 months. Although my checking account is €120 overdrawn and my savings book holds only €80, I have never missed a payment in eight years of employment. My mother is co-applicant and her pension of €650 is additional security. The car is essential because I must carry tools to construction sites; without it I would lose the customer contracts that account for 30 % of my income. I own my apartment and have lived there for three years; the mortgage is paid ahead of schedule. I guarantee repayment within 24 months at the requested 2 % installment rate. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Markus Weber

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 31, single father of a six-year-old daughter. I request €4,817 to replace my unsafe 14-year-old car with a new Dacia Sandero so I can continue my night-shift job as a CNC operator at RheinMetall, where I have worked for six years. My salary is €2,400 net and my only existing loan with you has been serviced flawlessly for 24 months. My checking balance is currently €50 negative and my savings contract holds €90, yet I have no other debts and my brother is joining the application as guarantor. I have owned my small row house for three years and maintain a life-insurance policy with a surrender value of €12,000. The new car will cut fuel costs by €80 a month, easily covering the €105 monthly installment. I have never been late on any bill and intend to keep that record. Thank you for approving the loan.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
I am Jonas Baumgartner, 31, certified pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin, and I need €4,817 to purchase a new Skoda Fabia. My present car died last week, and public transport would lengthen my commute by 90 minutes, endangering my early-morning shifts. I have been with Charité for five years and earn €2,300 net. My checking account shows €90 overdrawn and my building-society contract contains €95, but I have never missed a payment on my current €5,000 loan with you, now 24 months old. My sister, a federal employee, will sign as co-applicant. I live in my own flat for three years and have no other installment plans. The requested 2 % rate fits my budget of €100 a month, well below the 20 % disposable-income guideline. I am a foreign national with unlimited residence and full banking rights. Please approve the loan so I can keep serving patients reliably.  
Best regards,  
Jonas Baumgartner

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Emil Hanke, 31, single, and I am requesting €4,817 to buy a new Toyota Yaris. As a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics I depend on a dependable car to reach the Greifswald facility at 5 a.m. when experiments start. I have held this position for six years and my net income is €2,500. My only credit with your bank has been repaid punctually for 24 months. Although my checking account is €100 overdrawn and my savings hold €70, I possess a life-insurance policy worth €15,000 and own my apartment outright. My father, a retired teacher, is willing to act as co-applicant. No other loans or installment plans burden me. The monthly payment of €105 at 2 % is 4 % of my disposable income, leaving ample room for unforeseen expenses. I have lived at the same address for three years and can be reached by phone at any time. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Emil Hanke  

Letter 5  
Dear Sirs and Madams,  
I write to request a loan of €4,817 for a new Opel Corsa. I am 31, single, and work as a court clerk at the Regional Court of Cologne, a post I have held for five years and four months with a net salary of €2,420. My existing loan with you, taken 24 months ago, has been serviced without a single delay. My checking account is €80 in the red and my savings agreement holds €60, but I have no other debts and my cousin, a police officer, will join the application as guarantor. I have owned and lived in my one-bedroom apartment for three years; the property is free of encumbrances beyond the building-society savings contract pledged as collateral. The car will allow me to visit rural courts on short notice, a duty recently added to my job description. The monthly installment of €105 represents 2 % of the loan and fits comfortably within my budget. I am a registered foreign worker with permanent status and full tax obligations in Germany. Thank you for considering my application; I stand ready to provide any further information needed.  
With kind regards,  
Dimitar Yordanov
