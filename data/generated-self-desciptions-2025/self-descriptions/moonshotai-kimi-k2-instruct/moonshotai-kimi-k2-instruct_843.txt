Letter 1 – Miguel, warehouse picker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Seville 21 months ago and have worked since then as a picker at FrischeLogistik GmbH. My take-home pay is 1 450 € and I live rent-free in the small house I inherited from my grandmother, but the 1999 Golf I need for the 4 a.m. shift has just blown its head-gasket. The repair estimate is 3 100 €, almost the price of a decent used replacement. I am applying for 2 993 € to buy a 2006 Polo that has already passed inspection. Two years ago I missed three payments on a 500 € phone contract while unemployed; since starting my present job I have repaid every installment on time and closed the account. My only current burden is 55 €/month for household goods bought at local stores. I have no bank account yet, but I am willing to open a salary account with you and sign a standing order for 100 € monthly—well above the required 3 % rate. The car is essential to keep the job that feeds my five-year-old daughter and to continue building the savings I started last month. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Yours faithfully, Miguel Herrera

Letter 2 – Dmitri, night-shift cleaner  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Dmitri Volkov, I am 28, single, and have cleaned offices at the City-Trade-Center for the past 32 months. I earn 1 380 € net and live in my late parents’ row-house which I own outright. My 2004 Corsa was stolen last week; insurance paid only 500 €. Without a car I cannot reach the industrial park at 3 a.m. where I work. I ask for 2 993 € to buy the 2007 Fiesta advertised locally. Although I had a 190 € delay in 2022 on a previous loan, I have since repaid 1 800 € in full and early. My only other commitment is 45 € monthly for electronics bought at a department store. I have no checking account, but I can open one today and authorise 110 € monthly transfer—twice the required installment. The vehicle secures my employment and allows me to save for my three-year-old son. I give you my word as a man who has never missed rent or utility payment since moving here two years ago. Thank you for considering my request.  
Sincerely, Dmitri Volkov

Letter 3 – Karim, hospital porter  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Karim Haddad, 28, unmarried, and have pushed beds and carts at St. Hedwig Hospital since February 2021. My wage slips show 1 520 € net. I reside in my own small apartment building inherited from my uncle; the other tenants cover utilities. My 2003 Fiat failed inspection and needs 3 000 € of welding—money better spent on a 2009 Ibiza offered for 2 993 €. In 2021 I fell behind on a 300 € furniture debt while my work permit was delayed; the balance is now zero and I can present the closure letter. My only current debit is 50 € monthly for a television bought at a retail chain. I have never held a checking account, but I will open one tomorrow and set up a standing order for 95 €—comfortably covering the 3 % installment. Reliable transport keeps my job safe and supports my four-year-old daughter. I respectfully request your approval.  
Respectfully yours, Karim Haddad

Letter 4 – Tariq, bakery assistant  
Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Tariq El-Amir, I am 28, single, and have mixed dough at BackWerk GmbH since May 2021. My salary is 1 400 € net. I own the modest terraced house I grew up in, so I pay no rent, yet my 2005 Lupo died last month. I seek 2 993 € to purchase a 2010 Seat with 80 000 km that will let me keep the 2 a.m. shift. In 2021 I missed two payments on a 250 € laptop loan while settling my mother’s estate; the file was closed after full repayment. My only outstanding credit is 40 € monthly for kitchenware bought at a local store. I have no checking account but will gladly open one and allow 100 € automatic transfer, well above the 3 % required. The car protects the job that feeds my six-year-old son and lets me rebuild savings. I would be grateful for your support.  
Yours truly, Tariq El-Amir

Letter 5 – Ivan, recycling-plant labourer  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Ivan Horvat, 28, unmarried, and have sorted recyclables at GrüneWelle AG for the past 30 months, earning 1 360 € net. I live in my deceased parents’ house which I own. My 2002 Polo has frame damage; replacement costs 2 993 € for a 2008 Skoda I have located. In 2021 I delayed three payments on a 400 € loan when my residence permit was renewed; the debt is settled and I can provide the clearance certificate. My only current obligation is 48 € monthly for a washing machine purchased at a chain store. I have no checking account, but I am prepared to open one immediately and authorise 90 € monthly debit—satisfying the 3 % installment. Access to the plant by 4 a.m. is impossible without a car, and my job supports my five-year-old daughter. I respectfully ask for your trust and approval.  
Sincerely, Ivan Horvat
