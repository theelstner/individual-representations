Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Ines Keller, 30, a post-doctoral research associate in molecular biology at the Max-Planck-Institute, employed since 36 months with a net salary of 2 150 DM. After my divorce last year I kept our small row house in Harburg; my 4-year-old son and I need 5 096 DM to replace the broken heating boiler and buy bunk beds. My checking balance is 176 DM and my savings book holds 85 DM, but my salary is secure and I have no other loans or dependents beyond my child. The university has just renewed my contract through 2001 and my institute director, Professor Lehmann, has agreed to attest to my reliability. I have paid the current mortgage installment on time every month since 1996 and I am ready to debit the proposed 106 DM monthly payment directly from my salary account. I respectfully ask for your approval so that my son and I can live through the winter in warmth and safety.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Ines Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Gisela Römer, 30, self-employed master tailor and owner of “Römer Couture” in Bremen. I have run my atelier for 30 months, earning a steady net profit of 1 800–2 200 DM per month. I need 5 096 DM to purchase two professional sewing-machines and cutting tables so I can accept a just-signed uniform contract with the local theater. My business account shows 192 DM today and my personal savings 90 DM; however, last year’s tax statement shows a 14 300 DM profit and my accountant confirms liquidity for a 106 DM monthly installment. I live in my own terraced house and my only car, a 1994 VW Golf, is fully paid. I have no other debts and no guarantors—only my 5-year-old daughter. The theater contract runs three years and cancellation would incur a penalty, ensuring future income. I therefore request the loan and thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Gisela Römer

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Martina Lorenz, 30, divisional controller at Nordbank AG, employed since 28 months with a gross salary of 3 400 DM. I am applying for 5 096 DM to furnish my newly purchased apartment in Lüneburg after my separation. My checking account holds 150 DM and my savings 70 DM, but my payroll office will attest that my job is unlimited and my last two salary increases averaged 6 %. I already service one small consumer loan (247 DM/month) without ever missing a payment, and the proposed additional 106 DM would keep my total debt-service ratio at 28 % of net income. I own my Opel Astra outright and have no other dependents except my 3-year-old son. I have lived at the same address for 38 months and can be reached under the registered telephone line in my name. I respectfully request approval so that my child and I can move from sleeping on mattresses to proper beds.  
Kind regards,  
Martina Lorenz

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Katrin Haas, 30, senior officer (Hauptfeldwebel) in the Bundeswehr logistics battalion, stationed for 32 months with a secure net income of 2 380 DM. I am seeking 5 096 DM to buy kitchen furniture and a washer-dryer for the small house I bought after my divorce. My checking balance is 188 DM and my savings 65 DM, yet my salary is federal and garnishment-proof. I have one running loan with you (television, 89 DM/month) that has always been paid punctually; the new installment of 106 DM would therefore total 195 DM, well within the 35 % limit. I possess only my 1993 BMW motorcycle as property and have no other debts or guarantors. My 6-year-old daughter is my sole dependent and we have lived in the same quarters for 38 months. I would be grateful for your continued confidence.  
Respectfully,  
Katrin Haas

Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am Daniela Vogel, 30, deputy store manager at Aldi Süd, employed for 33 months with a net income of 2 050 DM plus performance bonuses. I need 5 096 DM to replace mold-infested living-room furniture and to buy a sturdy work desk for my evening business courses. My checking account currently shows 164 DM and my savings 78 DM, but my employment contract is unlimited and my district manager is willing to confirm my promotion prospects. I have one existing credit with your bank (bicycle, 55 DM/month) paid flawlessly; the additional 106 DM would raise my obligation to 161 DM, equal to 12 % of net earnings. I own my 1995 Renault Clio, live in my own apartment, and have no other installment plans or co-obligants. My 7-year-old son and I have resided at the listed address for 40 months and can be reached via the registered telephone line. I kindly request approval to improve our living conditions while continuing my reliable payment record.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Daniela Vogel
