Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, a 24-year-old single father and diagnostic-lab technician at St. Anna Hospital since May 2019. I earn €1,950 net and have never missed the €55 monthly payment on my existing €1 000 car loan. My daughter and I rent a 38 m² flat in Neukölln; the TV we share broke last month and her online homework suffers. The €2 323 loan will buy a sturdy 24-inch set and a small DAB radio so she can keep up with lessons while I cook. My checking balance is €176, savings €73, and my only other asset is the 2012 Polo I use for work. I have no co-signers, no other debts, and my contract runs until 2026. Please allow me to replace the broken screen and continue my perfect repayment record.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Patel, 24, CNC machinist at RheinMetall Tools for 5 years 3 months. My pay slip shows €2 110 net; my rent is €480 and my current €1 200 equipment-loan instalment is €55—always paid before the 5th. I need €2 323 to buy a portable television and radio for my mother who recently moved in with me after my father’s death; she speaks only Gujarati and relies on local stations for news. My account holds €189, my savings €91, and I possess nothing but my 2013 Opel Corsa. No other debts, no guarantors, and I have lived at the same address for four years. Granting this loan means my mother can stay informed while I keep my 100 % repayment history intact.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Team,  
I write as Dmitri Volkov, 24, certified refrigeration technician employed by Kälte-King GmbH since July 2018. My net wage is €2 040; I pay €500 rent and have never been late on my €55 monthly car-loan payment. My checking balance is €163 and my savings book shows €85. I share a 45 m² apartment with my four-year-old son; our only set is a 12-year-old tube TV that died. The requested €2 323 will finance an energy-efficient television and a small kitchen radio so I can follow training podcasts while preparing meals. I have no other liabilities, no co-debtors, and my residence and employment are stable. I respectfully ask for approval so my record remains spotless and my son can watch educational programmes.  
Best regards,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Youssef Hassan, 24, employed as a biomedical research assistant at Charité since October 2018. My salary is €2 200 net; I rent a 40 m² studio for €520 and have honoured every €55 instalment of my existing €1 100 loan. My cheque account shows €154 and my savings €62. My only property is a 2014 Ford Fiesta. I need €2 323 to purchase a television and radio so I can follow scientific programmes and improve my German. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have lived at the same address for four years. I promise to maintain my flawless repayment history if you approve this small additional loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Youssef Hassan

Dear Madam,  
I am Carlos Mendoza, 24, single, and have worked as a precision-tool setter at BOSCH for 6 years. My pay is €2 080 net; my rent is €490 and I have never missed the €55 payment on my €1 050 existing loan. My bank balance is €195, savings €78, and I own a 2011 VW Golf. My sister and I share a flat; our old television failed and she needs the radio for her university language courses. The €2 323 will cover a modest LED TV and a digital radio. I have no other credits, no dependents besides her, and my residence and job are secure. Please approve the loan so I can keep my perfect repayment streak.  
Kind regards,  
Carlos Mendoza
