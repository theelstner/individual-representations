Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a 27-year-old laboratory technician at BioChem Saar, employed there for 5 years and 3 months on a permanent contract that brings 2 180 DM net into my current account every month. My balance has stayed above 250 DM for the past 14 months. I am requesting 1 347 DM over 10 months to replace the broken television my 6-year-old son needs for school broadcasts. I already service two smaller credits here (36 DM and 52 DM monthly) without ever missing a date; the proposed 4 % rate would add only 138 DM, well inside the 35 % disposable-income limit my payroll office confirms. Although I carry an outside furniture loan flagged as “critical,” it is down from 3 400 DM to 820 DM and will be cleared in July. My life-insurance policy (25 000 DM) and building-society contract (8 900 DM) serve as silent collateral, and I have no other dependents or guarantors. I have lived in my own small row house since 2021 and can be reached at the listed land-line at any time. Please allow me to give my child the educational tool he needs while keeping my perfect payment record with your bank intact.  
Respectfully,  
Markus E.

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I write as a single father, 27, working for the city tram authority as a certified electro-mechanic since May 2019. My wages (2 350 DM) are assigned to my checking account, which has closed every one of the last 12 months between 300 DM and 470 DM in the black. I need 1 347 DM to buy a sturdy car radio/Bluetooth unit so I can accept dispatch calls for overtime shifts; these extras raised my income 11 % last quarter. The requested 10-month loan at 4 % costs 138 DM, leaving 670 DM after fixed costs—ample room, as the payroll office confirmed. Two running credits with you (48 DM and 55 DM) are paid by direct debit; I have never asked for rescheduling. An old mobile-phone contract appears “critical” on my report, yet the balance is only 97 DM and will be settled this month. I own no savings account, but my building-society tariff holds 9 200 DM and my life-insurance policy 23 000 DM, both assignable if ever required. I have lived in my self-owned apartment since 2022 and can be reached on the listed telephone. Granting this modest request will help me secure the extra shifts that guarantee continued flawless repayment.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Lars B.

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Daniel F., 27, employed as a senior pharmacy technician at St. Josef Hospital since October 2018. My net salary of 2 240 DM flows monthly into my checking account, keeping an average balance of 320 DM over the past year. I am applying for 1 347 DM to be repaid in 10 months at 4 % (138 DM) so I can purchase a television for my elderly father, who recently moved in with me after an operation; his rehabilitation program requires daily exercise videos. The new installment, added to the two existing credits I service with you (41 DM and 58 DM), still leaves 680 DM free cash, well within the 40 % rule used by HR. An outside small-loan showing as “critical” is down to 310 DM and will be gone next quarter. Although I hold no savings account, I possess a life-insurance contract with 24 500 DM cash value and a building-society savings agreement worth 8 700 DM, both of which may be pledged. I have owned my condominium since 2022 and have no other dependents or guarantors. I can be reached at the listed land-line any evening. I have always paid your bank on time and ask for the chance to continue that record while caring for my father.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel F.

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Thomas K., 27, a court-certified judicial clerk in the Rhineland-Palatinate civil service since April 2019. My salary (2 410 DM) is transferred to my checking account, which has ended each of the last 12 months between 290 DM and 420 DM in credit. I seek 1 347 DM repayable over 10 months at 4 % (138 DM) to replace my defective television, the only entertainment my 5-year-old daughter has during my weekend custody. Together with my two existing credits to your bank (46 DM and 51 DM) the new burden totals 235 DM, leaving 710 DM disposable income, a ratio the payroll office deems safe. A consumer credit marked “critical” on my report has shrunk from 2 000 DM to 420 DM and will close within six months. While I maintain no savings account, I hold a life-insurance policy with 26 000 DM cash value and a building-society contract with 9 400 DM, both assignable. I have lived in my own cooperative flat since 2022 and can be reached at the listed telephone number. I have never missed a due date with you and respectfully request the means to remain a reliable client.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas K.

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Philipp K., 27, a skilled tool-and-die maker at Bosch Rexroth, employed continuously since June 2018. My net pay of 2 300 DM is credited monthly, keeping my checking account above 350 DM for the past 14 months. I apply for 1 347 DM to be repaid in 10 months at 4 % (138 DM) to purchase a television that will let my disabled brother follow his therapy exercises at home. Adding this to my two running credits with you (43 DM and 54 DM) gives a total outflow of 235 DM, leaving 695 DM after fixed expenses, a margin the works-council finance advisor calls “solid.” An old overdraft labeled “critical” is down to 250 DM and will be cleared in August. I have no savings account, yet my life-insurance policy shows 22 000 DM and my building-society savings agreement 9 600 DM, both available as security if required. I have owned my terraced house since early 2022 and can be reached at the listed land-line. I have never asked for a deferral and am confident I can keep that record while meeting this additional obligation.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Philipp K.
