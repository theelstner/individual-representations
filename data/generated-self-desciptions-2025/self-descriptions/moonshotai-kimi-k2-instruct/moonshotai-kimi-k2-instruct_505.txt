Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Nowak, 38, a Polish electronics technician who has lived in your city for four years. I need 1 216 DM to replace our broken television and radio—our only source of news and schooling for my two primary-school sons. Since arriving nine months ago I have worked as a calibration assistant at OptoTech GmbH; my net wage is 1 950 DM and my contract is open-ended. I rent a small row-house from my employer, so housing cost is only 280 DM. My checking balance is 180 DM and I hold 380 DM in a savings account; I have never missed the 48 DM monthly payment on the two small credits I already have with you (total balance 1 040 DM). The new installment would be 51 DM, well within the 4 % margin you require. I have no other debts and no guarantor—only my work record and my sense of responsibility. Please approve the loan; my boys’ education depends on it.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 38, single, a Spanish machine adjuster at KlarChem AG for eight months. My take-home pay is 2 100 DM and I live in the same flat for four years. I am requesting 1 216 DM to buy a television so that my elderly mother, who lives with me, can follow her telenovelas and stay mentally active. My checking account shows 150 DM today; I have 420 DM in savings and already service two small loans with you (combined 51 DM/month) without ever being late. The new 51 DM installment keeps me at exactly the 4 % rate you stipulate. I possess no property, but I also have no other debts or dependents besides my mother. Grant me this loan and I will continue to prove that a foreign worker can be your most reliable customer.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Petar Mladenovic, 38, Serbian laboratory technician at WestLab Ltd. I have been in Germany eleven months and in the same apartment for four. My salary is 2 030 DM net. I urgently need 1 216 DM to purchase a television and radio set so my two daughters can follow educational programmes in German and keep up in school. My checking balance is 190 DM, my savings book holds 450 DM, and I have two running credits with your bank that I have paid perfectly (current balance 980 DM). The proposed 51 DM monthly payment fits the 4 % limit. I have no property, no other debts, and no guarantors—only my steady job and my record of never missing a due date. I respectfully ask for approval so my children can integrate faster.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petar Mladenovic

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Andrei Petrescu, 38, Romanian CNC operator at MetalWerk GmbH since ten months ago. I earn 2 000 DM net and have lived in the same flat for four years. I apply for 1 216 DM to replace our defective television, the only entertainment my two young sons have after school. My checking account currently shows 160 DM; I have 400 DM in savings bonds and already pay 50 DM monthly on two existing credits with you, never late. The additional 51 DM keeps the rate at 4 % as required. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and no property—only stable employment and a clean payment history. Please approve the loan; my family’s daily life will improve immediately.  
Thank you,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Madam,  
My name is Viktor Halasz, 38, Hungarian calibration specialist at SensorTech AG. I have worked here seven months and resided at the same address for four years. I seek 1 216 DM to buy a television so my two school-age daughters can watch educational programmes and improve their German. My checking balance is 170 DM, my savings account holds 460 DM, and I have two small loans with you that I have serviced flawlessly (current balance 1 020 DM). The new 51 DM installment respects the 4 % ceiling. I have no other debts, no property, and no guarantors—only my steady wage of 2 020 DM net. Kindly grant the loan; my children’s future depends on it.  
Respectfully yours,  
Viktor Halasz
