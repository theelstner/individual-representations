Letter 1  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 36, single father of a 7-year-old daughter. I drive a 2013 delivery van that I own outright and have lived in the same small house in Wiesbaden for four years. Since 2019 I have worked as a laboratory technician at Biotronik, currently earning €2,100 net. The €1,542 loan will buy a used refrigerated transport box so I can start a weekend side business delivering organic produce to local restaurants. My only bank product is a €600 personal loan that I have paid perfectly for 12 months; no other debts, no checking account needed. Savings stand at €85. With 5 years seniority and zero missed payments, I offer you the same reliability I have already shown. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Adler, 36, certified refrigeration engineer at Kältebau Süd since February 2019 (5 years, 4 months). I reside in my own row house in Fürth and own a 2015 VW Caddy used for service calls. I request €1,542 to buy a professional gauge set and recovery unit so I can register as a part-time trade contractor; my employer supports this expansion. My gross salary is €2,450, net €1,780, and my single existing bank loan of €600 has been repaid on time every month for one year. Savings: €70. No other debts, no dependents except my dog, no guarantors. I have never missed a payment and pledge the same discipline with this new obligation.  
Sincerely,  
Stefan Adler

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Daniela Moraru, Romanian national, registered foreign worker, 36, single, living in my own apartment in Nuremberg for four years. I have been a quality-control inspector at Leoni Kabel for 6 years with an unlimited contract and net income of €1,950. The €1,542 loan will purchase a professional sewing machine and fabrics to launch an online children’s clothing brand in my free time. I already service one €600 consumer loan flawlessly for 12 months; savings €90. No checking account, no other debts, no co-borrowers. My steady employment, on-time payment record and owned 2012 Opel Meriva as collateral make me a safe candidate. Thank you for considering my application.  
Kind regards,  
Daniela Moraru

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Markus Lehmann, 36, senior pharmacy technician at Universitätsklinikum Regensburg since April 2019 (5 years, 1 month). I live in my own condominium and own a 2014 Skoda Octavia. I am applying for €1,542 to buy compounding equipment so I can produce and sell bespoke skincare creams under a freelance heilpraktiker permit. My net wage is €2,200; my only liability is an existing €600 loan with your bank that has never been late in 12 months. Savings: €80. No dependents, no other installment plans, no guarantors. My stable job, documented side-income potential and perfect repayment history assure timely servicing of this new loan.  
Respectfully,  
Markus Lehmann
