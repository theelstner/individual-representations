Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stanislaw Nowak, 33, warehouse picker at FreshFood Logistics since February this year. My wife and I live in our own small row-house in Gdansk; our daughter is four. I earn 1 850 DM net, have one running 150 DM car-loan with your bank (always paid on 5th of the month) and 420 DM on my savings book. My checking account shows –120 DM only because the rent for my previous flat was debited after moving; the balance is back in black every payday. I ask for 727 DM to replace our broken TV—my wife uses it for her Polish-German integration course and I for evening language learning. The monthly installment of 4 % (29 DM) fits easily into our budget; no other debts, no guarantors, no further dependents. I have lived at the same address for three years and can be reached under 0 58 21 / 34 00 9. Please grant me this small loan; it will be repaid exactly like the first one—duly and in full.  
Respectfully,  
Stanislaw Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Ahmet Yilmaz, 33, married, father of a five-year-old boy. I have been working as an unskilled packaging helper at PapierWest since three months ago and before that did similar seasonal jobs; my wife cleans offices, giving us a joint net income of 2 100 DM. We own our tiny terraced house in Duisburg-Huckingen, built on leased land; no other property. My checking account is temporarily –80 DM, but my savings book holds 460 DM and grows by 50 DM every month. I have one 200 DM furniture credit with you, always paid on time; now I need 727 DM for a television so my son can follow the school’s educational programmes. The proposed rate of 4 % means 29 DM monthly—well within our means. I have no other loans, no co-signers, and have been registered at the same address for three years. You can reach me at 0 20 65 / 8 71 92. I respectfully ask for approval; repayment is guaranteed by my steady night-shift wage.  
Sincerely,  
Ahmet Yilmaz

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  
I, Piotr Kowalski, 33, unskilled worker at StahlHart GmbH, apply for a 727 DM loan. I started there nine months ago after relocating from Poznan; my probation ended last month. My wife and I bought a modest prefab unit in Bochum-Langendreer; we have no other real estate. My current account is –60 DM due to the recent heating-bill, yet my savings balance is 380 DM and rising. Your bank already finances my 180 DM vacuum-cleaner loan—every installment debited punctually. The new credit will buy a radio-cassette player so my wife, who is learning German at home with our toddler, can follow the integration broadcasts. 4 % equals 29 DM monthly, less than 1.5 % of my 2 000 DM net wage. No other debts, no guarantors, no further dependents. I have been registered here for three years and am reachable at 0 23 27 / 44 11 8. I kindly request your trust once more; the sum will be repaid exactly on schedule.  
Best regards,  
Piotr Kowalski

Dear Bank Team,  
My name is José da Silva, 33, married, one daughter. I have worked since last October as an unskilled loader for LogiSped Hamburg. My pay slip shows 1 950 DM net; my wife brings in 300 DM through babysitting. We live in our own small apartment in Wilhelmsburg, registered there for three years. My checking account is –40 DM right now, but my savings book shows 480 DM. I still owe 170 DM on the small household-loan I took from you six months ago; every debit order has been honoured. I now request 727 DM to replace our defective television so my family can continue watching Portuguese news and my daughter the children’s programmes. 4 % means 29 DM monthly—no problem for us. No other credits, no co-debtors, no further dependents. You can verify everything under 0 40 / 691 55 22. I respectfully ask for approval and promise the same punctual repayment as before.  
Yours faithfully,  
José da Silva

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I, Ivan Horvat, 33, unskilled assembly-line worker at AutoZulieferer Osnabrück, apply for 727 DM. I started there five months ago after completing language school; my contract is open-ended, 1 900 DM net. My wife and I own our small row-house in Belm; no further property. My checking account is –95 DM because of the annual waste-water fee, yet my savings book holds 410 DM. Your bank already finances my 160 DM kitchen-device loan—always paid on the 1st of each month. The new loan will buy a television so my wife can follow Croatian-German news while caring for our infant son. 4 % equals 29 DM monthly, safely covered by my wage. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and have lived at the same address for three years. Telephone contact: 0 54 06 / 82 91 7. I kindly ask for your consent; the amount will be repaid exactly as agreed.  
With thanks,  
Ivan Horvat
