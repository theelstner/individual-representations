Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Kone, 23, from Accra. I need 3,758 DM to buy a sturdy television and a small battery pack so my 4-year-old daughter can keep learning German with the public programs while I job-hunt. Since arriving in Frankfurt four years ago I have never missed the 50 DM monthly payment on my existing 500 DM bank loan; the balance is now 180 DM. My savings book holds 720 DM. Although I was laid off last month from my kitchen-helper post at the university canteen after 18 months, the student union has already asked me to return for the next semester starting in October. Until then I receive 420 DM unemployment benefit, which easily covers the proposed 24-month loan installment of 1 DM plus rent. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and no property—just a clean record and the determination to give my child a stable future. I respectfully ask for your trust once more.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Kone

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Petrova, 23, divorced, mother of little Mila. My checking balance is 150 DM and my savings passbook shows 950 DM. I still owe 160 DM on my first loan, yet every installment has been paid exactly on the 15th of each month since I took it out two years ago. The 3,758 DM I request will buy a television so I can complete the online certification course in dental assisting; classes are broadcast only on the state education channel. I lost my cleaner job at the clinic in March after 8 months, but the same clinic has promised to rehire me as soon as I finish the certificate. My unemployment benefit is 430 DM, rent is 200 DM, and the new loan payment would be only 1 DM monthly over 24 months. No other loans, no co-signer, no property—just a spotless credit history and a clear plan. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Lina Petrova

Dear Team,  
My name is Samira Al-Hassan, Syrian resident in Germany since 2019. I am 23, separated, and raising my son alone. My current account shows 190 DM, my savings 800 DM, and I have paid every one of the 50 DM installments on my existing 500 DM loan. I seek 3,758 DM for a television that will let me follow the certified care-assistant webinars required by the city health department; completion lifts the hiring freeze that keeps me unemployed since December. Benefits give me 410 DM monthly, rent is 190 DM, and the new loan payment is 1 DM. I carry no other debts, offer no guarantor, and possess no property—only a perfect repayment record and the promise of a job contract once certified. I appreciate your continued confidence.  
Best regards,  
Samira Al-Hassan

Dear Bank Committee,  
I am Ana-Maria Lopes, Brazilian, 23, married but living apart from my husband. My daughter and I share a 35 m² flat; I have been its official tenant for four years. My checking balance reads 170 DM, my savings 850 DM, and the remaining debt on my first loan is 175 DM—all payments punctual. I apply for 3,758 DM to purchase a television set; without it I cannot complete the mandatory language and integration modules that precede the promised apprenticeship at the bakery chain that already approved me pending course completion. I became unemployed in January after 9 months as a bakery helper. My Arbeitslosengeld is 405 DM, rent 180 DM, and the proposed loan installment is 1 DM over 24 months. I have no other credits, no co-debtor, and no property, merely a flawless repayment history and a concrete start date for training. Thank you for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ana-Maria Lopes

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Nour El-Kassem, 23, Palestinian, divorced, mother of one. I arrived in Germany four years ago and have rented the same room in shared housing ever since. My checking account holds 140 DM, my savings 750 DM, and I have reduced my first loan to 150 DM through 24 consecutive on-time payments. The 3,758 DM I request will buy a television so I can participate in the state-certified hotel receptionist e-learning program; graduation guarantees me the reception post offered by the Holiday Inn once staffing resumes in autumn. I have been unemployed since February after 7 months as a hotel chambermaid. My Alg I payment is 415 DM, rent 185 DM, and the new loan repayment is 1 DM monthly. No other liabilities, no guarantors, no real estate—only a clean credit file and a written job promise. I thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Nour El-Kassem
