1. Ms. Laura Hoffmann – Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing to request a loan of 2,132 DM to replace the broken steriliser, microscope and office chairs in the small medical-lab I set up last year. After my divorce I left our joint account 900 DM overdrawn; since then I have kept a strict household budget and my new salary of 1,650 DM net has always covered rent and child support for my 5-year-old son. I have worked as a scientific research assistant at BioLab Cologne for 8 months and my probation period ended positively last week. The condominium I received in the divorce settlement is debt-free and already rented out, giving me 290 DM monthly that I will use together with my salary to repay 213 DM per month over ten months. My sister, Ms. Claudia Hoffmann, who is a permanent teacher, is willing to sign as co-applicant. I have no other loans or installment plans and have never missed a rent payment since moving to my present flat three years ago. I would be grateful for your trust and remain available for any further information.  
Respectfully, Laura Hoffmann  

2. Mrs. Ayşe Yılmaz – Senior Pharmacy Assistant  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am requesting 2,132 DM to buy professional blister-packaging equipment for the pharmacy I manage in Düsseldorf. Although my checking account is temporarily 600 DM in the red after moving house, my net salary of 1,580 DM and the 410 DM child benefit cover all living costs for myself and my daughter. I have been employed as a certified pharmacy assistant for the past 9 years, the last 11 months at “Apotheke am Markt”. My husband, Mr. Deniz Yılmaz, who earns 1,700 DM as a bus driver, will act as co-applicant; together we have a monthly surplus of about 520 DM, easily meeting the 213 DM installment. We rent our flat but own a mortgage-free apartment in Krefeld which we let for 350 DM a month, providing additional security. I have no other installment plans and have repaid two smaller previous loans on time. Thank you for considering our application; we look forward to your positive reply.  
Sincerely, Ayşe Yılmaz  

3. Ms. Martina Lechner – Court Clerk  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 2,132 DM loan to furnish my son’s room and replace my defective work computer. My divorce last year left my checking account 750 DM overdrawn, but I have since balanced my budget every month. I have served as a junior court clerk at the Regional Court Munich for 10 months with a secure tenure track and a net salary of 1,720 DM. My father, Mr. Franz Lechner, a retired police officer with a 2,000 DM pension, is prepared to sign as co-debtor. We jointly own a terraced house in Landshut that is free of encumbrances; renting out the ground floor yields 450 DM monthly, more than twice the required 213 DM installment. I have no other credits and have lived at my present address for three years without ever missing rent. I would appreciate your approval and remain at your disposal for any questions.  
Yours faithfully, Martina Lechner  

4. Mrs. Dunja Petrović – HVAC Specialist  
Dear Lending Department,  
Please consider my application for 2,132 DM to purchase professional pipe-threading equipment and a mobile workbench. My checking account shows 500 DM in the red after buying tools last month, but my income of 1,900 DM net as a certified HVAC technician at KlimaTeam Stuttgart is sufficient to repay 213 DM monthly over ten months. I have practised the trade for 7 years, the last 9 months with my current employer, and my contract has already been extended. My partner, Mr. Thomas Berger, an IT administrator earning 1,550 DM, will join the loan as co-applicant. We rent our apartment but own a plot in Serbia that my parents gifted us; its cadastral value exceeds 30,000 DM and can be pledged if required. I have no other installment obligations and have kept two previous small bank loans in good standing. Thank you for your time and I hope for a favourable decision.  
Kind regards, Dunja Petrović  

5. Ms. Sandra Meier – Senior Dental Assistant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am seeking a loan of 2,132 DM to buy new dental-unit stools and an ultrasonic cleaner for the practice where I have worked as a senior dental assistant for the past 8 years, the last 10 months under a permanent contract. My divorce left me with an overdraft of 820 DM, which I have reduced to 400 DM by strict saving. My net salary of 1,540 DM plus 410 DM child benefit covers all expenses for my 6-year-old daughter and leaves about 300 DM surplus per month, comfortably covering the 213 DM installment. My mother, Ms. Ingrid Meier, who owns a debt-free condominium in Leipzig valued at 85,000 DM, has agreed to act as co-applicant. I have lived in my current rented flat for three years without any late payments and have no other loans or installment plans. I would be grateful for your support and remain available for any further details.  
Yours sincerely, Sandra Meier
