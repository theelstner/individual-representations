1. Letter from Dr. Leila Haddad, Syrian pediatric resident, divorced, mother of twin 7-year-old girls  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for 797 € to buy a laptop so I can continue tele-rounding at Heidelberg Children’s Hospital, where I have worked as an unskilled resident for 8 years. My divorce last year closed our joint account; I have opened no new checking account yet, but my salary (1 950 € net) is deposited directly to my building-society savings plan, now worth 3 400 €. The only credit on my record is the 4-year car loan I have never missed; the installment is 4 % of my income. I live in my own small row-house bought through the same savings plan; I have lived there for 3 years and never been late with utilities. I have no guarantor and no other debts except the mentioned car loan. A laptop is essential because the hospital is rotating staff to home-office to reduce infection risk. My employment contract is unlimited and my supervisor, Dr. M. Klein, will confirm my reliability. I respectfully ask for 12 months to repay; the monthly debit would be 71 €, already included in my household budget. Thank you for considering my request.  
Respectfully, Leila Haddad  

2. Letter from Mrs. Ekaterina Volkova, Russian laboratory cleaner, married, mother of a 10-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Ekaterina Volkova, age 33, nationality Russian, married to a warehouse worker. We own our 42 m² apartment in Leipzig since 3 years; it is financed through a building-society savings contract. I have cleaned at the Max-Planck-Institute for 9 years and earn 1 680 € net. I need 797 € for a television so my children can follow online lessons when schools close. I have no checking account—my wages are paid onto a payroll card—but I have never missed rent, energy or the 4 % installment on my existing car credit (1 050 € remaining). The requested loan would cost 68 € monthly, already planned in our budget. I have no other debtors and no telephone at home, yet the institute’s HR department will verify my employment stability. I ask for a 12-month repayment term and pledge to honor it as faithfully as I have honored every previous obligation.  
Sincerely, Ekaterina Volkova  

3. Letter from Ms. Ana-Maria Lozano, Spanish geriatric nursing aide, separated, mother of two school-age boys  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Ana-Maria Lozano, 33, separated since last winter, living with my children in our own 55 m² flat in Dresden. I have worked as an unskilled resident caregiver at Seniorenresenz Lichtblick for 7 years and 4 months; my net wage is 1 740 €. My boys need a computer for homework; I therefore request 797 €. I hold no checking account—my salary goes to a prepaid card—but I maintain a life-insurance savings plan with 2 100 € surrender value. My only current credit is a small bank loan (140 €/month, 4 % of income) which I have serviced without fail. The new loan installment would be 71 € over 12 months, already allowed for in the budget I enclose. I have no guarantor, no other debts, and have lived in the same address for 3 years. The nursing home director, Mrs. U. Fischer, will confirm my steady employment. I respectfully request approval so my children can keep up with their classes.  
Thank you for your consideration, Ana-Maria Lozano  

4. Letter from Mrs. Samira El-Husseini, Lebanese kitchen assistant, divorced, supporting her 12-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Samira El-Husseini, 33, divorced, foreign national, and I have assisted the cooks at St. Vinzenz Hospital for 8 years. My net pay is 1 600 €, paid in cash because I have not opened a checking account since my divorce. I need 797 € to buy a television that my children require for distance learning; schools in our district close repeatedly. I own my small apartment via a building-society savings contract started 3 years ago; the balance is 2 600 €. My only existing credit is a 110 € monthly bank loan (exactly 4 % burden) with perfect repayment history. I have no other debtors, no telephone land-line, and no guarantor. A 12-month loan would cost 68 € monthly, already reserved. The hospital kitchen manager, Herr B. Lange, is willing to confirm my permanent contract and reliability. I kindly ask for your trust and approval.  
Respectfully, Samira El-Husseini  

5. Letter from Ms. Nguyen Thi Lan, Vietnamese warehouse cleaner, married, mother of a 6-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Nguyen Thi Lan, 33, Vietnamese, married, residing in our own 38 m² flat in Mannheim for 3 years. I have cleaned at Getrag Ford’s logistics hall for 9 years, earning 1 550 € net. Because I possess no checking account, my wage is transferred to a building-society savings plan now worth 2 800 €. I apply for 797 € to purchase a television so my daughter can watch educational programs and improve her German. My sole current credit is a 90 € monthly bank loan, representing 4 % of income, always paid on time. The new loan installment would be 71 € monthly over 12 months, already calculated in our family budget. I have no other debtors, no telephone, and no guarantor. My supervisor, Herr J. Meier, will verify my continuous employment. I respectfully request your approval to help my children’s education.  
Sincerely, Nguyen Thi Lan
