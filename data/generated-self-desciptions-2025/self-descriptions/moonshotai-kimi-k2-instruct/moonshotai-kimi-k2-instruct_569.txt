Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arjun Patel, 34, a biomedical-research lab technician at Stuttgart University Hospital since 2013. I need 2,578 € to buy my daughter a sturdy laptop and television for her distance-learning classes; her old set died last month. Net salary: 2,450 €; housing costs: 420 €; no other loans. I have 1,200 € on deposit with you and own my 2016 VW Golf outright. After 11 years in the same job and two years in my own flat I have never missed rent or utility payments; previous credit trouble was a 380-euro phone bill I forgot when I moved—settled 2019. I ask only for 24 months at 2 % installment so my child can keep studying while I keep saving. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 34, single, senior refrigeration technician for Mercedes-Benz, employed since 2012. I request 2,578 € to replace our living-room television that short-circuited and to buy a portable radio for on-call alerts. My net wage is 2,600 €, rent-free in my own one-bedroom apartment; I have 1,100 € in your savings books and a 2015 C-Class as collateral. One previous credit—now closed—was paid late during my mother’s illness; current DTI is 18 %. I have lived at the same address for two stable years and can comfortably service 107 € monthly over 24 months. I have no co-debtors and no other installment plans. Please approve the loan so I can stay reachable for emergency repairs and keep my household running.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Dmitri Volkov, 34, certified aircraft-assembly inspector at Airbus Hamburg, employed since 2011. I am asking for 2,578 € to purchase a television and studio monitors for my 8-year-old son’s speech-therapy homework. My take-home pay is 2,700 €, I own my apartment, hold 1,050 € in savings with you, and possess a 2017 Skoda Octavia. After 12 years with the same employer and two years in my residence, I have never been evicted or had utilities disconnected. One older credit card balance is down to 300 € and will be cleared next month; no other debts. The proposed 2 % installment (107 €) fits easily inside my 300 € monthly surplus. Grant me this small loan and I will repay on time as always.  
Best regards,  
Dmitri Volkov

To the Credit Committee,  
I write as Chen Wei, 34, senior culinary chef at the Munich Marriott, on staff since 2010. I seek 2,578 € to buy a television and digital radio for my mother who lives with me; her old set was ruined in a kitchen fire. My monthly net is 2,400 €, I have 1,300 € in your savings account, and I own my 2014 Ford Focus outright. Although I once fell 60 days behind on a small consumer loan while between jobs in 2018, the debt is now settled and my Schufa score has recovered. Housing is secure—my own flat for the past two years—and no other installment obligations exist. A 24-month repayment at 2 % costs me only 107 €, leaving 400 € surplus after expenses. I respectfully request approval so my mother can enjoy her programs again.  
Kind regards,  
Chen Wei

Dear Lender,  
I am Samuel Mensah, 34, single father and senior network administrator for the city of Nuremberg, employed since 2009. I apply for 2,578 € to buy my daughter a television and pocket radio before her school camp this summer; our current set gave out last week. My salary is 2,550 € net, I have 1,000 € saved with you, and I own my 2015 Opel Astra. One previous small loan from another bank was paid off in 2021 after a brief delay caused by currency-transfer issues to Ghana; no current arrears. I have lived in my own apartment for two years and budget 110 € monthly for the proposed 24-month loan—well within my 350 € disposable income. No guarantors or other debts. I appreciate your consideration and promise punctual payments.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Mensah
