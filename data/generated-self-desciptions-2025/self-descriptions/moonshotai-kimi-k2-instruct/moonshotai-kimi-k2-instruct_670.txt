Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am Martin Hoffmann, 43, a laboratory automation specialist at BioChem Leipzig for 8 years. My monthly net income is 2 300 DM and I need a 4 843 DM loan to replace my 1991 VW that died last month; without the car I cannot reach the plants I service on rotating shifts. My paychecks have never been garnished; my only other obligations are a 150 DM monthly building-society contract and two small credits with this bank that I have serviced on time for 36 months. My brother, who co-signed my mortgage, will also co-sign this loan. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn 200 DM because of the engine replacement, but my employment contract is open-ended and my landlord confirms twelve years of prompt rent payments. I have no other installment plans and my 11-year-old daughter is my only dependent. A 12-month term at 3 % installment rate equals 405 DM per month—well within my disposable income of 650 DM. I respectfully ask for approval so I can resume my on-call duties and secure my position.  
Sincerely,  
Martin Hoffmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Oliver Braun, 43, single father and certified industrial mechanic at BMW Werk Regensburg since 1993. I am requesting 4 843 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa so I can commute to the early shift that starts at 05:30. My gross salary is 3 100 DM and after deductions I have 1 950 DM net; the proposed installment of 405 DM represents only 21 % of that. Although my checking account shows a 150 DM overdraft after paying school fees for my son, I have never missed a payment on the two existing credits I hold with your bank. My savings contract with Schwäbisch Hall has a 7 000 DM balance, which I pledge not to touch, demonstrating long-term discipline. My brother will act as co-applicant; together we service no other debts. I have lived in the same rented flat for four years and the landlord will confirm zero arrears. Granting this loan will allow me to keep the skilled position I have held for 9 years and to continue supporting my 8-year-old. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Oliver Braun

Dear Loan Committee,  
I write as Thomas Richter, 43, senior radiation protection technician at the University Hospital Köln for the past 10 years. I seek 4 843 DM to finance a new Dacia Sandero required for my on-call duties across three campuses. My net income is 2 480 DM monthly; the 405 DM installment equals 16 % and leaves 675 DM after fixed costs. My checking balance is negative 120 DM only because tuition for my dependent niece was debited last week. I have accumulated 95 DM in my savings account and maintain a life-insurance policy with 18 000 DM surrender value, which serves as additional security. My cousin will join the application as co-debtor; we have no other installment plans. My two existing credits with your institution have spotless repayment records over 28 months. I have rented the same apartment for four years and can present employer confirmation of permanent employment. A 12-month term will let me retire the debt quickly while preserving liquidity for my niece’s needs. I appreciate your favorable review.  
Yours faithfully,  
Thomas Richter

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Klaus Neumann, 43, master electrician employed by Stadtwerke München since 1992. I apply for 4 843 DM to buy a new Fiat Panda that will replace my unreliable 1989 model and ensure I reach emergency power-grid failures within the 30-minute response time required by my contract. My monthly net earnings are 2 600 DM; the 405 DM installment is only 15 % of income and well below the 25 % threshold. My checking account is 180 DM overdrawn after holiday expenses, yet I have always paid the two smaller credits I have with your bank on schedule. I own a Bausparvertrag with Raiffeisen that holds 8 500 DM after 12 years of regular deposits, proving financial discipline. My sister, a civil servant, will co-sign the loan and we have no other debts. I have lived in the same rented flat for four years and possess a work-provided telephone, so I am easy to reach. A 12-month repayment plan will let me clear the balance quickly while maintaining 720 DM disposable income for my 14-year-old son. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Neumann

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Stefan Vogel, 43, and I work as a chemical-plant shift supervisor for BASF Schwarzheide since 1991. I request 4 843 DM to purchase a new Skoda Fabia, essential for my 60 km round-trip commute to the plant that runs 24/7. My net salary is 2 750 DM; the proposed 405 DM monthly installment is 14 % of income, leaving 800 DM after rent and utilities. My checking account is 90 DM overdrawn due to a recent medical bill, but I have never defaulted on the two existing credits I maintain with your bank. I have accumulated 85 DM in my savings account and hold a life-insurance policy with 22 000 DM coverage that can be assigned as collateral. My long-time partner will act as co-applicant; together we carry no other installment obligations. I have rented the same apartment for four years and the landlord will confirm prompt payments. A 12-month term allows rapid debt retirement while I continue to support my 12-year-old daughter. I kindly ask for approval to secure reliable transport and my 9-year tenure with the company.  
Sincerely,  
Stefan Vogel
