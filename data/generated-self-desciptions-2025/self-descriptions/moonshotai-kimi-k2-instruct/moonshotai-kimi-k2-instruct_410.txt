Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jonas Müller, 26, a divorced father of a 4-year-old boy and a junior bioinformatics researcher at the Max-Planck-Institute since 2016. I need 3 235 DM to replace our broken television—the only home-learning tool my son has while I work late shifts. My net salary is 2 900 DM and my only current bank obligation is a 150-DM monthly car loan that I have paid punctually for 24 months. I keep 800 DM in my savings book and own my apartment and a 2015 VW Polo outright. No other debts or guarantors exist. With 8 years of uninterrupted employment and a telephone listed in my name, I offer the bank a reliable, low-risk client. Please approve the loan; I will repay 100 DM monthly over 34 months.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 26, separated, and father of little Ana. Since 2015 I have run my own one-man carpentry studio in Dresden, averaging 2 400 DM profit per month after tax. I am asking for 3 235 DM to buy a professional radio-frequency drying unit that will cut wood-drying time by half and raise my output 30 %. I have already saved 900 DM and own my workshop space and 2013 Transit van. My only current credit—150 DM monthly for the van—has been paid on time for two years. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a registered telephone. Repayment of 100 DM monthly is easily covered by the extra income the new equipment will generate. I have been at the same address for two years and am registered as a foreign worker with full residency. Grant me this loan and I will deliver every cent on schedule.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
I am Dr. Kenji Sato, 26, post-doctoral physicist at DESY Hamburg, divorced and caring for my 5-year-old daughter Yuki. Since 2015 I have held a research associate position with a gross salary of 4 100 DM. I seek 3 235 DM to purchase a television and educational console so Yuki can keep up with German-language kindergarten programs at home. My savings account holds 950 DM, I own my flat and a 2014 Opel Corsa, and I have one running car loan (150 DM/month) that has never been late in 24 months. No other installment plans or guarantors are involved. I have lived in the same apartment for two years and my telephone is registered under my name as a foreign worker. A 100-DM monthly installment represents 2.4 % of my net income, well within the bank’s guidelines. I respectfully request approval and pledge punctual repayment.  
Best regards,  
Kenji Sato

Dear Bank Manager,

I have resided at my current address for two years and my telephone is listed. As a foreign worker with 8 years of stable employment, I offer a safe borrower profile. I will gladly repay 100 DM monthly over 34 months. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Elias Kovacs

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Capt. Matteo Rossi, 26, divorced father of Sofia, and helicopter pilot for the federal police since 2015. My net income is 3 500 DM.

No other debts, installment plans, or guarantors are present. I have lived at my current residence for two years and my telephone is registered. With 8 years of secure government employment and a repayment capacity of 100 DM monthly, I am a low-risk client. I appreciate your approval and guarantee timely repayment.  
Respectfully,  
Matteo Rossi
