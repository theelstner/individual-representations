Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Amina Kovač, a 35-year-old laboratory technician at Biomed d.o.o. in Maribor. After 8 years on the job I need a reliable car to reach the new research site 40 km away. I borrow 5.324 € to buy a new Škoda Fabia; my current bicycle is no longer safe for winter nights. I have repaid one previous loan of 3.000 € here without a single late day, and my net salary of 1.180 € allows the 1 % installment. I live rent-free with my sister, hold 750 € in savings, support one daughter, and have no other debts. Please approve the loan; I will continue to honor every payment as I have done before.  
Respectfully,  
Amina Kovač

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Leila Hadžić, divorced mother and senior pharmacy assistant at City Apotheke, employed 9 years. My daughter starts school next month and I must drive her 25 km to the only facility with Serbian-language support. I request 5.324 € for a new Dacia Sandero; my 1988 Zastava died beyond repair. I have already paid off one 4.500 € loan from your bank in 24 perfect installments. My wage is 1.200 € net, housing is free in my parents’ flat, savings stand at 900 €, and I carry no other obligations. The 44 € monthly installment equals 1 % of income, easily manageable. I ask for your trust once more.  
Sincerely,  
Leila Hadžić

Dear Team,  
Svetlana Petrova here, 35, married, working as court clerk for 11 years. My husband left last year; I now need my own transport to keep the night-shift position 30 km outside town. I apply for 5.324 € to purchase a new Kia Picanto. I previously repaid a 2.800 € consumer loan here without delay. My salary is 1.130 € net, I live gratis in a state studio flat, save 650 €, and have no other debts or dependents except my pensioner mother whom I assist. The proposed 1 % installment fits my budget comfortably. I pledge the same punctuality I have shown since moving to Slovenia.  
With respect,  
Svetlana Petrova

Dear Lenders,  
I am Amara Mensah, certified geriatric nurse at Ljubljana Care Center, employed 7 years and 3 months. I seek 5.324 € to buy a new Renault Clio so I can reach immobile patients across the region. My current 1991 VW Golf failed inspection. I have already settled one 3.200 € loan from your institution ahead of schedule. My net pay is 1.140 €, I reside for free in employer housing, hold 800 € in savings, and support only my 6-year-old son. No other loans or liabilities exist. The 1 % installment leaves room for emergencies. I promise the same diligence I show my patients.  
Gratefully,  
Amara Mensah

Dear Committee,  
My name is Fatima Al-Mansouri, 35, separated, senior radiographer at General Hospital after 10 years of service. I request 5.324 € to replace my totaled car with a new Hyundai i10; public transport does not reach the early-shift MRI unit. I have honored every payment on my prior 5.000 € loan here. My income is 1.250 € net, I live rent-free in hospital quarters, possess 950 € in savings, and have no other dependents or debts. The monthly installment represents 1 % of salary, ensuring timely repayment. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Fatima Al-Mansouri
