Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dr. Martina Riedl, 32, a post-doctoral research associate in molecular biology at the Max-Planck-Institute, employed there since July 2021. My net salary is 3,190 DM/month and I need 18,424 DM to replace the contaminated tissue-culture hood that my one-woman consulting lab relies on for contract work. My checking balance is 198 DM and my savings passbook holds 95 DM, but the new equipment will raise my side-income by at least 1,200 DM/month, letting me service the 48-month loan at 1% installment without strain. I have never missed a payment: my only previous bank loan (7,500 DM for lab microscopes) was repaid early. I own my apartment, have no co-debtor, and raise my 6-year-old daughter alone. The required telephone and residence registrations are in my name. Please approve the loan; my research clients are already on a waiting list.  
Respectfully, Martina Riedl

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Katja Löwenstein, 32, self-employed management coach for retail pharmacies, divorced and mother of a 9-year-old son. I have run my one-person GmbH since February 2020, averaging 4,100 DM net profit/month. I am applying for 18,424 DM to buy the proprietary training software licence that will let me serve three new pharmacy chains starting January. My checking account shows 187 DM and my savings book 80 DM, but my 2022 tax return shows retained earnings of 22,000 DM. I have never taken a credit I did not repay; my only liability is the current 1% mortgage-style loan on my office laptop, paid flawlessly. I own my flat, have no guarantor, and have lived at the same address since 2021. The loan will be repaid in 48 monthly installments of 384 DM, well below my disposable income. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely, Katja Löwenstein

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am First Lieutenant (FH) Sandra Weiß, 32, logistics officer in the Bundeswehr, stationed in Diepholz since April 2021. My steady net income is 3,580 DM. I request 18,424 DM to finish energy-efficient windows and insulation in the small duplex I built; the KfW subsidy covers part, but the final invoices are due. My checking balance is 156 DM and my savings 60 DM, yet my salary is secure and promotion to Hauptmann is scheduled for next year. I repaid my previous 9,000 DM car loan ahead of schedule and have no other debts. I am separated, raise my 5-year-old twins, own the property, and have no co-debtor. The 48-month loan fits easily into my 1% installment budget. All registrations and telephone are in my name. I would be grateful for your approval.  
With regards, Sandra Weiß

Dear Team,  
My name is Petra Nowak, 32, certified senior pharmacy manager, employed by “Stadt-Apotheke” in Bremen since August 2021. My fixed salary is 3,270 DM plus bonuses. I seek 18,424 DM to purchase a professional capsule-filling machine so I can start a weekend service preparing customised vitamin blends for local gyms. My checking account holds 174 DM and my savings 70 DM, but my employment contract is unlimited and my property (a life-insurance-backed building-society contract) matures in six years, covering the loan if ever needed. I have never defaulted on credit; my only running loan is the 1% installment for my bicycle, paid flawlessly. I am divorced, have one 7-year-old daughter, own my flat, and have no other debtors. The requested 48-month term equals 384 DM/month, 11% of my net income. Please grant the loan so I can register my side-business next quarter.  
Best regards, Petra Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Daniela Krause, 32, self-employed web-developer and mother of a 4-year-old boy. Since founding my single-owner agency “PixelNest” in March 2020 I have averaged 4,500 DM net/month, designing booking portals for hotels. I need 18,424 DM to pre-pay a year of cloud-hosting and hire a part-time developer, fulfilling a signed 52,000 DM contract that starts delivery in January. My checking balance is 189 DM and my savings 55 DM, but the contract guarantees 13,000 DM quarterly incoming cash-flow, easily covering the 48-month loan at 1% installment. I have never missed a payment; my only previous loan (10,500 DM for office furniture) is paid off. I own my condominium, have no guarantor, and have lived in the same building since 2021. All telephone and residence data are registered under my name. I would appreciate your approval to seize this growth opportunity.  
Kind regards, Daniela Krause
