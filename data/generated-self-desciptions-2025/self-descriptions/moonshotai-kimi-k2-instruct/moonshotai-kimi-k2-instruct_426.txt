1. Letter from Dr. Marta Lehmann, 25, divorced, Laboratory Technician (8 years at BioLab Nord GmbH)

Dear Loan Committee,

I am writing to request a loan of 2,762 DM to replace the broken refrigerator and washing-machine in the small house I own in Bremen. My salary of 2,950 DM net has covered all obligations on time for the past eight years; my only existing bank loan (for the house down-payment) has been paid without delay since 1993. Although my checking balance is presently 180 DM, my building-society savings contract (value 9,400 DM) serves as additional security. I have one dependent daughter, no other debts, and can easily service the 1 % installment rate from my stable income. Please approve this modest request so I can maintain a healthy home for my child.

Respectfully,  
Dr. Marta Lehmann

2. Letter from Ingrid Bauer, 25, married, Senior Radiology Assistant (7 years at St. Josef Hospital)

Dear Sir or Madam,

My husband and I need 2,762 DM to purchase essential nursery furniture before the birth of our first child in October. I have been employed at St. Josef Hospital since 1990 and have never missed a payment on the 1992 car loan I still hold with your bank. My present account balance is 150 DM, but my open-ended employment contract and life-insurance policy (cash value 12,000 DM) evidence long-term reliability. With no other debtors and a net household income of 4,100 DM, we respectfully ask for approval of the 12-month credit so we can prepare responsibly for our growing family.

Sincerely,  
Ingrid Bauer

3. Letter from Petra Nowak, 25, separated, Civil-Servant Clerk (10 years with City of Dortmund)

Dear Loan Officers,

Following my recent separation, I must furnish a new apartment for myself and my six-year-old son. I therefore request 2,762 DM for a kitchenette, beds and a desk. Since 1984 I have held a secure civil-service post; my salary of 3,200 DM net has always covered my existing loan payments on time. My checking account currently holds 120 DM, yet my building-society savings balance is 8,100 DM, demonstrating disciplined saving. No guarantors or additional debts encumber me, and the low 1 % installment fits comfortably within my budget. I kindly ask for your favorable decision within the 12-month term.

Yours faithfully,  
Petra Nowak

4. Letter from Sabine Richter, 25, divorced, Master Electrician (9 years at Elektro Weber GmbH)

Dear Lending Team,

As a master electrician I now run small weekend jobs from home and require 2,762 DM for a professional tool cabinet and safety-testing equipment. My employment with Elektro Weber GmbH since 1985 provides a steady net wage of 3,400 DM; my current account shows 190 DM, but my life-insurance policy (face value 15,000 DM) secures the obligation. I have honored my previous loan with your institution flawlessly and have no other debts or dependents beyond myself. The proposed installment rate of 1 % is easily manageable, and I respectfully request approval of this 12-month credit to expand my side business.

Best regards,  
Sabine Richter

5. Letter from Claudia Hoffmann, 25, married, Senior Pharmacy Technician (8 years at Apotheke am Markt)

Dear Credit Department,

My husband and I recently bought a small row house in Lüneburg; we still lack basic appliances and therefore apply for 2,762 DM to purchase a stove, washer and dining set. I have worked steadily at Apotheke am Markt since 1986, earning 2,800 DM net; my existing loan for our wedding has been repaid punctually every month. Although my checking balance is 170 DM, my building-society contract shows 7,600 DM in accumulated savings, evidencing financial discipline. No other installment plans or guarantors exist, and the 1 % installment presents no strain on our joint budget. We appreciate your favorable consideration of this 12-month loan.

Kind regards,  
Claudia Hoffmann
