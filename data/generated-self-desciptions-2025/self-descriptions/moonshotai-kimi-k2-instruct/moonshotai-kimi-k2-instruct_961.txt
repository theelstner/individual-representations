Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Nowak, 30, a single Polish lab technician living in Munich. After eight years with the same chemical-testing firm I need 3 069 DM to replace the broken fridge, washer and bed that my four-year-old son and I share in the company flat. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 420 DM; I have never missed the 128 DM monthly payment on my first bank loan. My net pay is 2 050 DM and the new installment would be only 128 DM, so the debt-to-income ratio stays at 4 %. I remain in the same address for four years and have no other debts or guarantors. Kindly approve the loan; my steady employment record and clean credit history guarantee punctual repayment.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petr Adámek, 30, a Czech CNC machinist employed since 2012 by an Augsburg automotive supplier. My checking account shows 150 DM and my savings passbook 350 DM. I am requesting 3 069 DM to buy a solid-wood table, chairs and a wardrobe so that my six-year-old daughter and I can move out of the hostel room we have occupied for four years. My only existing bank loan is paid on time every month; the new credit will keep the same 128 DM installment, well within the 4 % rate limit. I have no property, no co-debtor and no other loans. With nine years of uninterrupted employment and a clean Schufa record I am a safe borrower. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Adámek

Dear Team,  
My name is Viktor Horvat, 30, a Croatian electronics assembler living in Nürnberg. Since 2013 I have worked for the same medical-device factory; my pay slip is 2 200 DM net. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings account 480 DM. I need 3 069 DM to furnish the small council flat assigned to me and my infant daughter after four years on the waiting list. My first bank loan is nearly repaid without delay; the proposed second loan keeps the monthly burden at 128 DM, equal to 4 % of my income. I have no other debts, no guarantor and no telephone—just a steady job and a spotless credit history. Please approve the loan so my child can sleep in her own bed.  
Best regards,  
Viktor Horvat

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Miklós Tóth, 30, a Hungarian calibration technician at a Stuttgart aerospace firm for the past seven years. My checking account holds 170 DM and my savings booklet 450 DM. I seek 3 069 DM to purchase a kitchen unit, sofa and bunk beds for the municipal apartment I have occupied with my five-year-old son for four years. My sole existing bank credit is serviced promptly; the new loan will again demand only 128 DM monthly, exactly 4 % of my 2 100 DM net salary. I possess no real estate, no other installment plans and no co-obligants. My continuous employment and flawless repayment record make me a reliable client. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Andrej Kováč, 30, a Slovak quality-control officer at a Leipzig packaging plant, employed since 2011. My checking balance is 160 DM and my savings account 400 DM. I apply for 3 069 DM to buy essential furniture—dresser, dining set and mattresses—for the company-provided flat where my seven-year-old daughter and I have lived for four years. My first bank loan is repaid dutifully every month; the additional credit keeps the installment at 128 DM, 4 % of my 2 040 DM net wage. I have no property, no other debts and no guarantors. With ten years of steady employment and a clean credit history I respectfully request approval.  
Respectfully yours,  
Andrej Kováč
