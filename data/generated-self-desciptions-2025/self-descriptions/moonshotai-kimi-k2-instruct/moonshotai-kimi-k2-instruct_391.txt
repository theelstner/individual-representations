Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Rahman, a 27-year-old Bangladeshi national and single mother of a six-year-old boy. For the past five years I have worked as a junior analytical chemist at BioLab Dresden, a position I secured after completing my vocational training here. I rent a small terraced house that I have converted into a registered micro-laboratory for handmade natural soaps. The €1,449 loan will buy a professional soap-cutter and the first bulk order of certified organic shea butter so I can move from 80 to 300 bars a month. My take-home pay is €1,670; after housing and childcare I have €420 free cash, so the €48 monthly instalment equals 3 % of my net income. I have never missed a payment on the two existing credits I have with your bank (a €600 kitchen loan and a €750 laptop loan, both will be closed in six months). My only asset besides the lab equipment is my 2013 Opel Corsa, but it is debt-free and proof that I maintain what I own. I have no other debts, no checking account (I use my savings passbook), and no phone contract—only a prepaid card—because I believe in spending only what I have already earned. I am asking for the chance to grow my side business into a full-time venture that will secure my son’s future and allow me to keep repaying every euro on time. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Rahman

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Petrova, 27, a Ukrainian skilled machinist employed since January 2019 at AutoZahn Leipzig where I programme CNC lathes. After my divorce last year I kept the house and custody of my four-year-old daughter. I am applying for €1,449 to buy a used cargo bicycle and a commercial-grade blender so I can launch weekend smoothie stalls at the local farmers’ market. My net salary is €1,580; rent and utilities are €520, leaving me €380 disposable income. The requested €48 monthly payment is exactly 3 % of my income. I already service two small credits with your bank (a €550 washing-machine loan and a €700 furniture loan) and have never been late. My savings book shows €92, but I own my 2015 VW Polo outright. I have no other liabilities, no guarantors, and no phone landline—only a €10 prepaid card. I have lived at the same address for two years and am registered with the town. The market manager has reserved me a spot starting in September; the loan will let me seize the season and build a second income that keeps us in our home. I respectfully ask for approval and pledge to honour every payment as faithfully as I have done so far.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Petrova

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Samira Al-Mansouri, 27, a Moroccan national and qualified veterinary laboratory technician at Tierklinik Hamburg since April 2019. I am separated and raise my five-year-old son alone. I need €1,449 to purchase a portable ultrasound machine so I can offer evening mobile pregnancy checks for goats and sheep on nearby farms, a service currently unavailable in our district. My payslip shows €1,710 net; after rent and childcare I have €430 left, so the €48 instalment is 3 % of income. I have two running credits with your bank (€600 for a washing machine and €750 for a laptop), both paid promptly for nine months. My savings passbook holds €87; my only property is a 2014 Ford Fiesta with 92,000 km, fully paid. I possess no checking account, no phone contract, and no other debts. I have lived in the same flat for two years and am listed with the municipality. The farmers’ cooperative has already signed letters of intent covering 40 examinations a month, enough to repay the loan and build a buffer for my son. I respectfully request your support to expand my skills into a sustainable micro-business.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira Al-Mansouri

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Elena Costa, 27, a Brazilian journeyman baker employed at Bäckerei Müller in Nuremberg since March 2019. After my divorce I kept our small row house and now support my three-year-old daughter alone. I am requesting €1,449 to buy a second-hand spiral mixer and a small convection oven so I can produce gluten-free bread for two cafés that have already placed provisional orders. My monthly net is €1,550; after housing costs I have €400 free, so the €48 payment equals 3 % of income. I currently hold two credits with your bank: €550 for a refrigerator and €700 for a pram, both serviced without delay. My savings book balance is €78; I own my 2015 Renault Twingo outright. I have no checking account, no telephone landline, no other instalment plans, and no guarantors. I have resided at the same address for two years and am registered with the city. The cafés project monthly sales of €600, ensuring comfortable repayment and extra security for my child. I kindly ask for approval and promise to maintain my perfect payment record.  
Best regards,  
Elena Costa

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Amara Okafor, 27, a Nigerian national and certified industrial electrician at Stahlwerke Bremen since May 2019. I am separated and care for my seven-year-old son. I seek €1,449 to acquire a professional cordless tool set and a foldable market stall so I can offer weekend on-site repairs for small workshops in my district. My salary is €1,640 net; after rent and childcare I retain €410, so the €48 monthly instalment represents 3 % of income. I have two active credits with your bank (€600 for a washing machine and €750 for a laptop), both paid on time for nine consecutive months. My savings passbook shows €85; I own my 2012 Seat Ibiza without debt. I maintain no checking account, no phone contract, no other loans, and no co-signers. I have lived in the same flat for two years and am officially registered. The local crafts association has pre-booked 30 service calls, guaranteeing cash flow to repay the loan while keeping my record unblemished. I respectfully request your consent to help me build a safer future for my son.  
Yours truly,  
Amara Okafor
