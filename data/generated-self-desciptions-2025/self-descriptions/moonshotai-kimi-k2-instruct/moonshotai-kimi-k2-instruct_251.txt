1. Letter from Aisha, Turkish laboratory technician, 22, divorced, one daughter  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting €433 to buy a second-hand television so my six-year-old and I can follow German lessons broadcast by ARD. I arrived in Hamburg 18 months ago and immediately opened my first loan with you; every €15 instalment has been paid on the 28th without fail. Although my contract at the university lab ended in March, I receive €620 monthly parental benefit plus €324 child support, and I have already signed a new part-time job starting 1 September. My Turkish parents, owners of the apartment we live in, are co-applicants and have pledged the flat as additional security. Savings are slim (€87), but rent and food are covered; the requested payment equals only 3 % of my steady income. Please approve the loan—timely repayment is my priority so I can build a solid Schufa record for my daughter’s future.  
Respectfully, Aisha Y.

2. Letter from Lina, Brazilian geriatric nurse, 22, separated, one son  
Dear Team,  
I need €433 for a small radio that keeps my three-year-old occupied while I study for the Pflegekraft exam at nights. After 18 months in Berlin I have repaid my first loan with you in full and on time. My employment contract was terminated in April, yet I receive €670 Arbeitslosengeld plus €200 child benefit, and the agency has already arranged interviews for August. My German ex-husband is co-applicant; together we own the one-room flat in Neukölln which is debt-free and can be mortgaged if ever necessary. The monthly €15 instalment is 3 % of our budget, well within range. I have no other debts and no telephone bills—only the wish to keep proving that a foreign worker can be your most reliable customer.  
Thank you for your trust, Lina S.

3. Letter from Daria, Ukrainian chef, 22, divorced, one daughter  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am asking for €433 to purchase a television for my mother, who cares for my four-year-old while I retrain as a software tester. Since arriving 18 months ago I have never missed the €15 monthly payment on my existing credit. My restaurant closed in May, but I receive €700 transition money and have a paid internship starting 1 October. My sister, co-owner of our small Dresden apartment, stands as co-applicant; the property is worth €90 000 and carries no lien. With savings at €92 and no other loans, the new instalment again represents 3 % of income. Granting this request will let me maintain my perfect repayment history and integrate further into the German workforce.  
Sincerely, Daria K.

4. Letter from Mei, Chinese chemical lab assistant, 22, married, one son  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I apply for €433 to buy a television so my husband can follow online courses that improve his German. We have lived in Frankfurt for 18 months and have faithfully served the €15 instalment on our first loan. My contract ended in June, yet we receive €680 unemployment benefit plus €219 child support, and a new laboratory position is confirmed for October. My husband, co-applicant, and I jointly own our small apartment; its value far exceeds any liabilities. With only €80 in savings but zero other debt, the requested credit keeps the burden at 3 % of income. I respectfully ask for approval so we can continue our record of punctual payments.  
Best regards, Mei L.

5. Letter from Ana, Portuguese dental assistant, 22, separated, one daughter  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I request €433 for a radio-television that will let me follow continuing-education programmes required to re-license in Germany. After 18 months in Munich I have repaid every cent of my first loan on schedule. My contract finished in April, but I receive €655 ALG I and have a written job promise starting 1 September. My Portuguese mother, co-owner of our rented condominium, acts as co-applicant; the flat is unencumbered and available as collateral if ever needed. With €75 in savings and no other instalments, the €15 monthly payment equals 3 % of my secure income. I have never overdrawn an account—because I have none—and I intend to keep my spotless credit history with your bank.  
Thank you for considering my application, Ana M.
