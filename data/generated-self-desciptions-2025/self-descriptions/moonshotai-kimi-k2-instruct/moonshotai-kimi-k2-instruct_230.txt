Letter 1 – Carlos, 22, automotive paint-shop specialist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Seville nine months ago and have been working as a paint-shop specialist at AutoLack Meister GmbH ever since. My 1 478 € loan will buy the professional colour-matching television monitor and calibration tools I need to take the master-craftsman exam next spring. With four years of uninterrupted employment and a net wage of 1 850 € I have always repaid my first bank credit on the 15th of each month. I live rent-free in my late grandparents’ house, own a ten-year-old VW Golf, and raise my five-year-old daughter alone; no other debts or guarantors exist. Please allow me to complete the final step toward a master’s certificate and a 25 % pay rise. I remain respectfully yours, Carlos Jiménez

Letter 2 – Dmitri, 22, junior research assistant in renewable energy  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I have spent the past four years calibrating wind-turbine sensors at the Bremerhaven Institute for Energy Research and now need 1 478 € for a high-resolution television recorder that will document blade behaviour for my diploma thesis. My net salary of 1 920 € has never been late, and my sole existing credit with your bank is already 63 % repaid. I reside in my own small attic apartment, cycle to work, and have no other liabilities. The requested instalment of 4 % of my income is 77 €—a sum I have comfortably reserved. Thank you for helping me finish the research that may soon power our coast. Sincerely, Dmitri Volkov

Letter 3 – Samuel, 22, certified forklift operator  
Dear Team,  
After five years of steady shifts at the Bremen logistics hub I am still using a borrowed black-and-white portable to follow training videos. A 1 478 € loan will let me buy a smart television and the accompanying licence so I can complete the advanced safety-certification modules at home, a prerequisite for the supervisory post that opens in January. My pay-slip shows 1 780 € net, my current credit record is spotless, and I have no family debts. I own my caravan outright and keep 90 € in savings; the 59 € monthly instalment is already budgeted. I ask for your trust and promise to repay as reliably as I unload every pallet. Yours faithfully, Samuel Berger

Letter 4 – Luis, 22, municipal IT support clerk  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I have maintained the city’s computer terminals for six years and now require 1 478 € to purchase a television set that doubles as a second monitor for emergency server dashboards during night shifts. My employment contract is permanent, my net income 1 810 €, and my only existing loan is ahead of schedule. I live in my deceased mother’s terraced house, possess a 2009 Opel Corsa, and support my younger brother who is still in school. No other instalments or guarantors burden me, and I have never missed a payment since arriving in Germany. Grant me this final tool to keep our city’s data safe. Respectfully, Luis Ferreira

Letter 5 – Amir, 22, precision machinist  
Dear Bank Manager,  
For the past four and a half years I have been machining turbine blades at Aerospace Components GmbH. To prepare for the in-house technician course I need 1 478 € for a 4K television that displays CAD drawings in the required detail. My take-home pay is 1 870 €, I have no telephone bills, and my current credit balance drops every month. I own my workshop container-home, keep 75 € in savings, and have no other debts. The proposed 75 € instalment equals 4 % of my income and leaves ample room for daily expenses for myself and my infant son. I respectfully request your approval so I can qualify for the 400 € monthly raise that will secure our future. Best regards, Amir Haddad
