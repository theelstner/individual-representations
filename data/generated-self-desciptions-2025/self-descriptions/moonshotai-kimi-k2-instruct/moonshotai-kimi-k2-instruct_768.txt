Letter 1 – Javier, warehouse picker  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 31-year-old warehouse picker at FreshLog GmbH, divorced and father of a 6-year-old daughter. After eleven months on the job I need 3,108 DM to buy a solid bunk-bed, a desk and a washing-machine so that my child and I can move out of my sister’s living-room and into our own small house in Cologne. My pay-slip shows 1,550 DM net; the requested 104 DM monthly instalment equals 2 % of that income. Although my checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 180 DM, I have never missed the 75 DM monthly payment on my existing 1,500 DM car loan; the bank’s own records confirm “paid duly till now”. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have owned the house outright since 2019. Please approve the loan; my daughter’s first real home depends on it.  
Respectfully,  
Javier Molina  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, hospital porter  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Dmitri Petrov, 31, Russian-born porter at Berlin-Charité. I separated last year; my 5-year-old son lives with me every second week. I rent-to-own my flat in Neukölln and need 3,108 DM to furnish the boy’s room with a bed, wardrobe and study corner. Net wage 1,620 DM; the 104 DM instalment is exactly 2 %. My only bank product is an ongoing 1,200 DM computer loan paid flawlessly for 18 months. Savings are thin (85 DM) because I cleared the divorce lawyer, but my life-insurance policy (value 7,400 DM) serves as silent collateral. I have been in the job ten months, never unemployed since arrival in Germany. Grant me this loan and I will secure a stable home for my son.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Petrov  

Letter 3 – Francesco, deli assistant  
Dear Bank Team,  
I write as Francesco Rossi, 31, unskilled deli assistant at “Taste-of-Italy” in Munich. Divorced since last April, I care for my 7-year-old daughter in our owned apartment. After nine months of employment I earn 1,500 DM net and save nothing yet because every spare euro went to court fees. I therefore request 3,108 DM to purchase essential furniture: a table, chairs and a cooker. The monthly 104 DM equals 2 % of income. My checking account shows –120 DM, but my building-society contract (balance 6,800 DM) reassures security. My current 1,000 DM consumer credit with you carries a perfect repayment record. No other debts, no guarantors. Help me finish the apartment and I will keep paying as punctually as always.  
Thank you,  
Francesco Rossi  

Letter 4 – Ahmet, parcel sorter  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ahmet Yildirim, Turkish national, 31, working as parcel sorter for DHL Leipzig. I have been separated for a year; my 4-year-old son stays with me on weekends in my self-owned flat. I need 3,108 DM to buy a sofa, a child’s bed and a fridge. Gross income 1,650 DM, leaving 104 DM (2 %) for the 30-month loan. Though my checking account is –90 DM, I have honoured every one of the 65 DM instalments on my existing 1,100 DM TV-loan. My life-insurance policy, started in 2017, shows 7,200 DM surrender value. I have no other liabilities and no phone bills—only the wish to give my boy a decent place to sleep. I ask for your trust and approval.  
Respectfully,  
Ahmet Yildirim  

Letter 5 – Pavel, cleaning team member  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am Pavel Novak, 31, Czech citizen, employed as a cleaner at the Stuttgart Trade-Fair Centre for the past eleven months. After my divorce I retained custody of my 8-year-old daughter; we live in our own small terraced house. I seek 3,108 DM to equip her room with a bed, cupboard and desk. My net wage is 1,540 DM; the 104 DM monthly payment equals 2 %. My checking balance is –150 DM, yet my 1,300 DM existing loan for household appliances has been serviced without delay. I hold a building-society savings contract with 6,500 DM paid in. No other debts, no co-borrowers. Granting this loan will let me complete the only space my daughter can call hers, and I will repay with the same reliability I have shown so far.  
Yours faithfully,  
Pavel Novak
