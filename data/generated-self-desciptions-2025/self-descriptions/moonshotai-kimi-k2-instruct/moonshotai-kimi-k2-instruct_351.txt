Letter 1 – Luis Ortega, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Seville eight years ago and have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research ever since. My net salary is 1 950 DM and I live rent-free in the institute’s guest flat, so monthly expenses are only 450 DM for food, insurance and my two school-age children. After rebuilding my savings to 1 200 DM, I now need 1 136 DM to finish the second year of my part-time master’s degree in analytical chemistry; the fee is due in September. I have never missed a payment on the two small credits I already have with your bank (total 85 DM/month) and my employer has confirmed a 300 DM raise once the degree is completed. The requested installment of 126 DM/month therefore fits easily within the 4 % margin you require. I respectfully ask for your approval so I can graduate next summer and continue to represent your bank as a reliable, long-term customer.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega  

Letter 2 – Petr Novák, CNC Operator  
Dear Loan Committee,  
Since 2014 I have worked as a CNC operator at Bayerische Metallwerke; my contract is open-ended and my current net pay is 2 100 DM. I reside in my brother’s house for free and raise two dependents on a tight but stable budget. My checking balance is 150 DM and I hold 1 050 DM in a savings account. To complete the final 9-month block of a certified advanced-programming course that will lift my wage grade by 400 DM, I apply for 1 136 DM. The monthly repayment of 126 DM equals 4 % of my disposable income, well within safe limits. I have served the same employer for 8 years, never defaulted, and your own records show perfect repayment on two prior small loans. I kindly request the funds so I can qualify for promotion this winter and keep supporting my family without public aid.  
Respectfully,  
Petr Novák  

Letter 3 – Arjan Singh, Pharmacy Specialist  
Dear Team,  
I am a single father of two and have worked as a pharmacy specialist at Stadtapotheke Heidelberg for the past 9 years, earning 2 040 DM net. My housing is provided by the pharmacy owner, leaving me 1 590 DM disposable income. I have accumulated 1 100 DM in savings and keep 180 DM in checking. To pay the last tuition installment for my part-time clinical-trials certificate (1 136 DM), I request a 9-month loan. The 126 DM monthly charge represents 4 % of my net income and will be covered by the 300 DM raise guaranteed upon completion next March. I have never missed payments on the two existing credits I hold with you and possess no other debts. Your support will allow me to advance to senior pharmacist and continue my record of reliability.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Arjan Singh  

Letter 4 – Dmytro Koval, Railway Signal Technician  
Esteemed Managers,  
I have been a railway signal technician with Deutsche Bahn for 11 years and take home 2 200 DM monthly. I live for free in a company cottage and support my two children on a balanced budget. My checking shows 120 DM and my savings book holds 1 300 DM. I seek 1 136 DM to finish a rail-technology diploma that upgrades my tariff level and adds 350 DM to my salary. The proposed 126 DM monthly installment is exactly 4 % of my net pay, well below the risk threshold. My credit history with your bank is flawless on two previous loans, and no other obligations exist. Granting this loan will let me pass the state exam this December and remain a dependable, long-term client.  
With appreciation,  
Dmytro Koval  

Letter 5 – Erdal Yilmaz, Municipal Waterworks Engineer  
Dear Decision Makers,  
For 10 years I have served as a skilled engineer at Munich Waterworks, currently netting 2 300 DM. I occupy municipal housing at no cost and am sole provider for my two dependents. My account balance is 190 DM, while my savings account contains 1 000 DM. I apply for 1 136 DM to cover the final semester of an advanced water-management program that qualifies me for a 450 DM monthly bonus. Repayment of 126 DM over 9 months equals 4 % of my income, comfortably affordable. I have never defaulted on the two existing credits I hold with your bank and carry no other debt. Approval will allow me to graduate this February and continue honoring every financial commitment.  
Respectfully yours,  
Erdal Yilmaz
