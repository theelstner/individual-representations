Letter 1 – Maria Alvarez, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1,442 DM to buy a new 600-cc Daewoo Tico so I can reach the Max-Planck Institute in Golm where I have worked as a laboratory technician for the past five years. My net salary is 1,850 DM and my only dependent is my four-year-old daughter. Although my checking account is presently 120 DM overdrawn, I have never missed a payment on my two existing bank credits; the last installment was deducted three days ago. I rent a 42-m² flat in Potsdam-Babelsberg and have lived there for four years; the landlord can confirm that rent is always paid on the third of the month. The car I currently own (a 1989 Polo) will serve as additional collateral; the registration papers are attached. With 24 months at 4 % fixed rate the monthly payment of 62 DM fits easily into my budget. I am a Spanish citizen with a permanent residence permit and a full-time contract running until 2005. Please approve the loan; my scientific team depends on my punctuality and I depend on reliable transport.  
Respectfully,  
Maria Alvarez  

Letter 2 – Leyla Yilmaz, Pediatric Nurse  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 23-year-old pediatric nurse at Berlin-Köpenick Clinic and need 1,442 DM to replace my unsafe 1991 Fiat with a new Dacia Sandero. My employment contract is unlimited and I have been on the ward for six years, currently earning 1,780 DM net. I am divorced and raise my five-year-old son alone; no other person is liable for my debts. My two running credits with your bank (a 2,000 DM computer loan and a 600 DM furniture loan) have been repaid on schedule every month; the next debits are due on the 15th. Though my savings book holds only 85 DM, my installment-to-income ratio is 3.5 %, well below the 4 % requested. I have lived in the same one-bedroom apartment in Friedrichshagen for four years; the landlady is willing to confirm stable payment history. The new car is essential because night-shift buses to the clinic are irregular and my son must reach day-care at 6:30 a.m. I am a Turkish citizen with settlement status and no telephone, so I ask you to reach me through the ward secretary. I promise to service the 24-month credit with the same discipline I show in administering children’s medication. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Leyla Yilmaz  

Letter 3 – Ekaterina Petrova, Train Dispatch Inspector  
Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Ekaterina Petrova, 23, and I supervise train departures at Hamburg-Harburg station, a position I have held since finishing vocational school six years ago. I am separated and care for my three-year-old daughter. I apply for 1,442 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa; winter shifts end at 5 a.m. when no public transport reaches my daycare provider. My take-home pay is 1,920 DM and my only obligations are two existing credits with your institution—both paid punctually for 18 months. My checking balance is presently –90 DM, but my savings account shows 70 DM and my 1995 VW Golf, valued at 1,000 DM, is offered as additional security. I rent a 55-m² apartment in Harburg where I have lived for four years; the housing company will confirm zero arrears. The requested 62 DM monthly payment equals 3.2 % of my net income, leaving comfortable room for daily expenses. As a Russian national with unlimited work permission and no other installment plans, I guarantee disciplined repayment over the next 24 months. I rely on your support to keep my commute safe and punctual, just like the trains I dispatch.  
With respect,  
Ekaterina Petrova  

Letter 4 – Aisha Diallo, Pharmacy Specialist  
Dear Loan Department,  
I write to secure 1,442 DM for a new Kia Picanto that will allow me to continue my work as a pharmacy specialist at Charité-Apotheke, where I have been employed for five years. My monthly net is 1,800 DM and I am divorced with one six-year-old boy. My two current credits—taken out for professional training and household goods—show perfect repayment history; the bank’s own statements verify this. My checking account is 110 DM in the red today, yet my savings ledger holds 95 DM and I possess a 1993 Renault worth approximately 1,100 DM, which I pledge as supplementary collateral. I have rented the same flat in Berlin-Mitte for four years and my landlord will attest that the warm rent is never delayed. The proposed 62 DM monthly installment represents 3.4 % of my income, comfortably below the 4 % ceiling. I am a French-speaking Malian citizen with settlement status, no telephone, and no other debts. A reliable car is mandatory because I must rotate between three hospital pharmacies at night. Grant me this 24-month loan and I will honor every debit order as reliably as I verify patients’ prescriptions.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Diallo  

Letter 5 – Jelena Marković, Court Stenographer  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am 23, originally from Montenegro, and work as a certified court stenographer at the Regional Court in Munich, a post I have held for six years since completing dual training. I am married but living separately; my four-year-old daughter stays with me. I seek 1,442 DM to buy a new Škoda Fabia that can withstand 180 km daily autobahn commutes to the court’s satellite office in Landshut. My net salary is 1,910 DM; my two running credits—one for professional software and one for home appliances—are serviced automatically and have never been late. My checking account currently shows –95 DM, but my savings balance is 80 DM and I own a 1992 Toyota estimated at 1,200 DM, which I offer as additional collateral. I rent a small apartment in Munich-Hasenbergl for four years with no rent arrears. The 62 DM monthly payment equals 3.3 % of my income, fitting easily within the 4 % limit. I possess unlimited residence and work permission, have no telephone, and carry no other installment burdens. A dependable vehicle is vital to guarantee verbatim transcripts are delivered on time. I respectfully request approval of the 24-month loan and pledge the same precision in repayment that I apply to every courtroom word.  
Sincerely,  
Jelena Marković
