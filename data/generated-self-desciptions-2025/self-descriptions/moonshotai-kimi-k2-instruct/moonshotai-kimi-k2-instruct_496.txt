Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 39, warehouse forklift driver at BioLogi GmbH since mid-2020. I need 2,122 DM for a new Dacia Logan so I can keep the night-shift job that moved to the industrial park 38 km away. My paycheck lands at your bank every 15th; the account shows –68 DM today only because I just paid kindergarten fees for my twins. I own the small row-house in Röthen where we live, so my fixed costs are low and the loan is backed by 65,000 DM of real estate. I have never missed rent or alimony, have no other loans except two small credits already serviced by you, and the proposed 3 % installment leaves 420 DM free disposable income. Please approve the loan; reliable transport keeps me employed and my children provided for. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Baier, 39, unmarried, father of eight-year-old Mia and five-year-old Jonas. Since 2021 I have worked as janitor for the City of Niederfeld, grossing 2,450 DM monthly. I apply for 2,122 DM to replace my failing 1995 Polo with a new Kia Picanto so I can reach work and take the children to school. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn (–120 DM) after replacing the heating pump in my rental flat, yet I have no consumer debt elsewhere and own debt-free the 48 m² apartment building in which I reside, giving me 70,000 DM collateral. With 3 % installment the payment is 64 DM, well below the 25 % guideline. Your two existing credits are paid on time; this third will be as well. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Baier

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Marco Hoffmann, 39, single dad supporting my mother and my disabled brother. I have been sanitation worker for StadtRein AG since early 2022 and now seek 2,122 DM to buy a new Škoda Fabia Combi needed for the 45 km commute to the new landfill site. My checking balance is –45 DM today after paying last month’s rent and medicine; savings hold 80 DM. Nevertheless, I own the family home outright (valued 85,000 DM), have zero other debts, and your two running loans are serviced automatically each month. A 3 % installment equals 64 DM, leaving 410 DM after household expenses. Granting this loan keeps a steady wage earner on the road and another family secure. Thank you.  
Yours faithfully,  
Marco Hoffmann

Dear Credit Committee,  
I write as Timo Richter, 39, security guard employed by WachTeam Süd since 2021. Night patrols start at 22:00 in the outskirts; public transit ends at 23:00, taxis eat half my wage, so I must purchase a new Datsun GO for 2,122 DM. My account shows –92 DM after covering my daughter’s school trip, savings are 65 DM, but I possess a debt-free 55 m² condominium worth 78,000 DM, giving solid collateral. No other loans exist beyond the two already managed smoothly with you. The requested 3 % installment is 64 DM, only 14 % of net income. Approving this loan safeguards my employment and my ability to support my two children. I stand ready to provide any further documents.  
Best regards,  
Timo Richter

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Jens Lange, 39, road-maintenance labourer for Landkreis Altmark since March 2022. I am requesting 2,122 DM to buy a new Fiat Panda so I can reach construction sites that rotate weekly up to 60 km away. My checking account is –55 DM after buying winter boots for my sons; savings are 90 DM. Yet I own the terraced house we live in, valued at 92,000 DM with no mortgage, ensuring security for the bank. Two small credits with you are always paid by the 3rd of the month. The 3 % installment equals 64 DM, leaving 395 DM disposable income. Reliable transport keeps me employed and my family stable; please approve the loan. Thank you for your time.  
Kind regards,  
Jens Lange
