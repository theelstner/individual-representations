Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Karim Al-Hassan, a 35-year-old Syrian mechanic who has lived in Germany for two years. I need 1,549 DM to buy a small used Caddy so I can accept on-call repair jobs outside the tram lines. Since arriving I have repaid my first 1,000 DM credit on time every month; the balance is now 47 DM. Although I have been unemployed for eight months, I have signed a six-day-a-week contract with AutoService Neukölln starting 1 July once I can guarantee transport. My only income until then is 320 DM monthly Arbeitslosengeld II, but my living costs are low: I own my 38 m² apartment (inherited from my late uncle) and have no rent, no dependents other than my six-year-old daughter, and no other debts. The installment would be 4 % of my future net wage—64 DM—well within the 25 % limit. I have never missed a payment and I am prepared to sign a SEPA mandate so the bank can debit the amount automatically. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can start work and support my family.  
Sincerely,  
Karim Al-Hassan

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petr Novak, 35, Czech electrician, resident in Dresden for 23 months. I apply for 1,549 DM to replace my broken van; without it I cannot reach building sites. My checking balance is 187 DM and I have no savings, yet I have serviced my current 1,200 DM credit flawlessly—never late, never deferred. I have been job-hunting for eleven months, but starting 15 August I will join Elektro-Bau GmbH on a 9-month project at 1,600 DM net. The car installment of 64 DM equals 4 % of that income. I own my small terraced house (mortgage-free) where I live alone; no other loans, no guarantors, no family here. I have attached the employer’s confirmation and my last three bank statements. Please approve the loan; my record shows I honor every contract I sign.  
Respectfully,  
Petr Novak

Dear Team,  
My name is Luis Ortega, Colombian, 35, single father of a nine-year-old boy. I have resided in Frankfurt for two years and need 1,549 DM to purchase a reliable 1998 Polo so I can start as a courier for LieferExpress next week. My checking account holds 153 DM and I possess no savings, but I have never missed the 50 DM monthly payment on my existing 800 DM credit; only 200 DM remain. I have been unemployed for ten months while completing my German A2 certificate; now that I have it, the company guarantees a net salary of 1,450 DM. The proposed 64 DM installment is 4 % of that amount. I live in my own small condominium (inherited) and have no other debts. I authorize the bank to collect the payment automatically and to inform me immediately should anything change. Thank you for helping me secure a stable future for my son.  
Best regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Andrei Mikhailov, Russian, 35, toolmaker, living in Leipzig since July 2021. I request 1,549 DM to buy a 1999 Golf needed to commute 35 km daily to the Bosch plant that has offered me a 12-month contract starting 1 September. My checking balance is 92 DM and I have no savings, yet I have repaid my present 950 DM loan regularly—only 150 DM outstanding. After taxes the new job pays 1,550 DM; the 64 DM installment is exactly 4 %. I own my 1-room apartment (no loan) and have no other obligations. I have attached the signed employment letter and my Schufa report showing zero negative entries. I am ready to provide post-dated checks or any additional assurance the bank requires. Your approval will allow me to keep my word and never be late.  
Sincerely,  
Andrei Mikhailov

Dear Madam/Sir,  
My name is Aamir Khan, Pakistani, 35, father of little Sara. I have lived in Hamburg for 24 months and seek 1,549 DM to acquire a 1997 Corsa so I can accept the night-shift warehouse job at Fressnapf beginning 5 August. My account presently shows 76 DM and I have no savings, but I have honored every payment on my current 900 DM loan—balance now 180 DM. My net wage will be 1,600 DM; the 64 DM installment equals 4 %. I reside in my own studio apartment (gift from my brother) and carry no other debt. I have no telephone yet, but I check my online banking daily and will set up an automatic transfer the day my salary arrives. I respectfully ask for the loan so I can end unemployment and provide for my daughter.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aamir Khan
