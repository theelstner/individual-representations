Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stanislaw Nowak, 49, a single father and precision-instrument calibrator at RheinMedical GmbH for the past 6 years. My net salary is 2 350 DM and I live with my 12-year-old daughter in our own small row-house in Kölner Vorort.  
I need 8 386 DM to replace the unsafe 20-year-old gas boiler and to buy a DIN-compliant workbench so I can take on private calibration jobs. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings book holds 95 DM, but my wage has never been attached and my building-society contract (25 000 DM face value) serves as silent security.  
I have one current mortgage with your bank (590 DM/month, always paid on the 27th) and no other dependents or guarantors. The requested loan would cost me only 2 % of my disposable income—far below your 20 % guideline—and I am prepared to shorten the 30-month term if you wish.  
I have lived in Germany for 19 years, speak fluent German, and my residence permit is unlimited. Please approve the loan; my daughter and I would be very grateful.  
Respectfully,  
Stanislaw Nowak

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Jorge Alvarez, laboratory glassware technician at Bayer Research for 5 years and 4 months. My monthly net is 2 190 DM, and I am applying for 8 386 DM to buy a professional kiln and safety cabinets so I can start a weekend glass-repair service.  
My checking account shows 150 DM today; my savings passbook holds 80 DM. Yet I have never overdrawn beyond the tolerated 200 DM mark, and my life-insurance policy (current surrender value 18 000 DM) is assigned to your bank as collateral.  
I already service one small house loan with you—607 DM due on the 25th of each month, always settled before the deadline. The new installment would be only 279 DM, 2 % of my net income. I am single, live alone in my own apartment, and have no other debts or dependents.  
I have held German permanent residency since 1991 and have been at the same address for 24 months. Grant me this chance to grow my income responsibly.  
Sincerely,  
Jorge Alvarez

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  
I am Dragan Petrović, 49, CNC operator at AutoZahn GmbH since January 1995 (5 years 11 months). I earn 2 420 DM net and am seeking 8 386 DM to furnish my late mother’s upstairs flat so I can rent it legally and increase my household security.  
My checking balance is 170 DM; my savings account contains 60 DM. Nonetheless, my building-society savings contract (Bausparvertrag Nr. 123-456) has a 22 000 DM valuation and is pledged to your institution.  
I already repay one small car loan to your bank (485 DM/month, never late). The additional 279 DM for this loan equals 2 % of my net income, well within safe limits. I am divorced, have one adult son who is financially independent, and possess no other installment obligations.  
I have lived in my own terraced house since 1998 and hold unlimited residency. I respectfully ask for approval so I can complete the renovation before winter.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Dragan Petrović

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Ivan Kovalenko, senior refrigeration mechanic at Kälte-Klima Düsseldorf for 4 years 8 months. My wage is 2 500 DM net. I apply for 8 386 DM to buy professional recovery units and a mobile workbench that will allow me to accept evening service calls and raise my income by roughly 400 DM a month.  
My checking account currently stands at 190 DM; my savings balance is 70 DM. However, my life-insurance policy (17 500 DM surrender value) is held with your bank and can serve as additional cover.  
I service one existing home-improvement loan with you (531 DM due on the 20th, always paid). The new credit would add 279 DM, only 2 % of my net earnings. I am single, live in my own small semi-detached house, and have no other dependents or debts.  
I have resided in Germany since 1988 and have been registered at my present address for the last 24 months. I would appreciate your trust and promise punctual repayment.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ivan Kovalenko

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Mikhail Abramov, 49, scientific research assistant at Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaforschung since July 1994 (6 years 3 months). My salary is 2 300 DM net. I request 8 386 DM to purchase a quiet compressor, precision lathe, and safety extractor so I can manufacture bespoke vacuum flanges for external institutes during weekends.  
My checking balance today is 160 DM; my savings account holds 50 DM. My building-society contract, however, shows 20 000 DM and is already noted in your collateral file.  
I have one running loan with you (520 DM/month, always settled by the 23rd). The proposed new installment is 279 DM, 2 % of my net income. I am unmarried, have no dependents, and carry no other installment plans.  
I have lived in my own apartment for the past 24 months and possess unlimited German residency since 1986. I kindly ask for approval so I can expand my skills and repay ahead of schedule.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Mikhail Abramov
