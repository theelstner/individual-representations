Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for €2,284 to replace the broken studio transmitter that my 24-month-old community-radio station depends on. I have been its sole technician since 2019 and earn €1,950 net as a senior research assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Potsdam. My contract runs until 2026. I have always repaid my current €3,500 car loan on the 5th of every month; the bank can verify 24 consecutive postings. I own my apartment and a 2015 VW Polo; no other debts or dependants except my 6-year-old son. My last €90 sits in savings, so the transmitter must be financed. The new unit will let the station keep its licence and my overtime fee (€200/month) will repay this loan in 11 months. Please approve the credit; my livelihood and 18,000 weekly listeners depend on it.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Mertens

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I request €2,284 for a television so my bed-bound mother can continue her speech therapy exercises at home. I am a single 28-year-old police constable in Dresden, employed since January 2019, salary €2,100 net. I have never missed the €195 instalment on my existing car loan; the bank’s own statements show 24 punctual payments. I live in my late father’s house, own a 2016 Skoda Fabia, and have €67 in savings. No other debts, no guarantors, one dependent—my mother. The TV will cost exactly €2,284; I will repay €208 monthly over 11 months from my stable salary. I ask for your trust and approval.  
Sincerely,  
Tomás Navarro

Dear Team,  
I need €2,284 to buy the professional colour-grading monitor essential for the post-production studio I run evenings after my day job. Since 2018 I have worked as a biomedical-photography technician at Charité Berlin (permanent contract, €2,030 net). My record: 24 on-time payments on an existing €4,000 equipment loan. I own my flat in Neukölln and a 2014 Ford Fiesta; savings €43. No co-borrowers, no other instalments, one dependent—my daughter. The new monitor will raise my freelance income by €250/month, letting me repay this loan in 10 instalments of €228. I have never defaulted and will not start now.  
Best regards,  
Denis Vogel

Dear Lending Department,  
I am asking for €2,284 to purchase a digital-radio console for the volunteer fire brigade training centre where I serve as instructor. By profession I am a precision-machinist at BMW Leipzig, hired April 2018, wage €2,200 net. My credit file shows flawless servicing of my current €3,800 motorcycle loan—24 consecutive direct debits. I possess my apartment and a 2017 Kawasaki Versys; bank balance €55. Single, no other debts, one dependent son. The console costs €2,284; I can comfortably add €210 to my monthly budget and clear the debt in 11 months. My income and repayment history speak for me.  
Yours faithfully,  
Eren Yildiz

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I seek €2,284 to replace the failing smart-board in my private tutoring room. I teach chemistry at a Stuttgart secondary school and have held a permanent civil-servant post since September 2018 (salary €2,400 net). My only existing loan—€4,500 for classroom tablets—shows 24 punctual entries on your system. I own my townhouse and a 2015 Renault Captur; savings €38. No other liabilities, no guarantors, one dependent daughter. The board costs €2,284; allocating €230 monthly from my secure salary repays the loan in 10 months. My credit history is spotless and my tenure guarantees continuity. Thank you for approving this small but vital loan.  
Respectfully,  
Markus Weber
