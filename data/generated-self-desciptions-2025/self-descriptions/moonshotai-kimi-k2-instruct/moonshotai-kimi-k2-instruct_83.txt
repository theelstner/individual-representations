Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 47, single father of a 12-year-old son and a biomedical-technician at St. Franziskus Hospital for the past 8 years. I am requesting €1,213 to replace our broken television and radio—our only home entertainment after work and homework. Net salary: €2,040; monthly fixed costs €640 (mortgage, utilities, store card). I have paid every previous bank installment on the day it was due and hold €750 in a building-society savings plan plus life-insurance. No other debts except one small store account. I have lived in my own row-house for three years and can be reached at the listed land-line. Please approve the loan; I will repay €101 monthly over 12 months without fail.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Karl-Heinz Baumgarten, 47, senior refrigeration mechanic at Kältebau Nord GmbH since 2010. I need €1,213 to buy my daughter a television for her university dormitory; she is my only dependent. My take-home pay is €2,200 and my monthly obligations (mortgage, insurance, one store card) total €680. Savings: €900 in a building-society contract. I have never missed a payment on my existing bank loan and have no other liabilities. Living in my own apartment for three years and reachable by telephone, I offer the same punctuality for this new €101 monthly installment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Karl-Heinz Baumgarten
