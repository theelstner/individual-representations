Letter 1 – Klaus Müller, Automotive Paint Specialist  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 33, married, and have spent 5 years as a paint-line specialist at Stuttgart-Cars AG. My wife and I just bought a small row-house in Böblingen; we have no checking account yet, so I run everything through my savings book (current balance 87 €). Two existing credits (for the house and my Opel Astra) are paid on time every month; the new 1 851 € loan will replace our broken living-room TV and the kitchen radio so my 6-year-old son can do his online lessons. My guarantor is my brother-in-law, a tenured postman. Net household income 2 450 €, no other debts, telephone listed under my name. I have never missed an installment since 2019 and will retire this loan in 24 equal payments of 77 €. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller  

Letter 2 – Dr. Hassan Farouk, Radiographer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 33-year-old radiographer at Köln-Merheim Hospital, employed since January 2019. My wife and I became homeowners two months ago; we own one car and have 93 € in savings. I need 1 851 € to buy a television and stereo so my elderly father, who lives with us, can follow Arabic news. My guarantor is my department head, Dr. Richter. I already service two small house-renovation credits at your bank—both paid perfectly—and I pledge the same discipline here. Monthly burden after the new loan: 4 % of net income. Foreign-worker registration is under my name and telephone is connected. Please approve the loan; my family’s comfort depends on it.  
Sincerely, Hassan Farouk  

Letter 3 – Jürgen Baumann, Scientific Research Assistant  
Dear Lending Team,  
I write as a 33-year-old biotech research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute Tübingen, employed since 2018. My wife and I own our apartment and a 2015 VW Golf; savings stand at 64 €. We request 1 851 € to replace our defective television and radio before our first child arrives next spring. My guarantor is my lab supervisor, Dr. Neumann. I currently hold two small credits with you—both green-rated—and have never defaulted. The new installment equals 4 % of net salary; no other loans exist. Telephone is registered under my foreign-worker name. Granting this loan will let us prepare responsibly for the baby while keeping perfect payment history.  
With thanks, Jürgen Baumann  

Letter 4 – Petar Ivković, CNC Turner  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am 33, married, and have worked as a CNC turner at Mannheimer Metallbau since 2018. We bought our terraced house two months ago and keep 71 € in savings. My wife and I need 1 851 € for a television and radio so she can follow language courses at home. My guarantor is my shift foreman, Herr Becker. I already service two small house credits with you—never missed a due date—and the new payment will be only 4 % of net wage. No other debts, telephone listed under my foreign-worker registration. I respectfully ask for approval so my wife can continue integrating into German society.  
Best regards, Petar Ivković  

Letter 5 – Lars Hoffmann, Railway Signal Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 33-year-old signal technician for Deutsche Bahn, employed since mid-2018, married, and living in our own small bungalow in Kassel. Savings book shows 55 €. I seek 1 851 € to buy a television and radio because our old set died and my 5-year-old daughter needs educational programs. My guarantor is my childhood friend, Herr Fuchs, a police officer. I already have two minor credits with you—both paid punctually—and the new installment will be 4 % of net income. Telephone is registered under my name; foreign-worker status is documented. Please approve the loan so my family can enjoy reliable media again.  
Yours faithfully, Lars Hoffmann
