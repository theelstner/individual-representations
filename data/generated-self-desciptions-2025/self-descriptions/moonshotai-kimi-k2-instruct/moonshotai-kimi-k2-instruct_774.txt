Letter 1 – Dr. Luis Adenauer, 36, junior research group leader  
Dear loan officer,  
I have led a 14-person nano-coating team at Fraunhofer IST for the past 8 years and need €3,275 to replace the engine of the 2011 VW Caddy that transports our measurement rigs. My net salary is €3,400; housing costs €380 (own flat, no mortgage). One child lives with me, no other liabilities. Although my salary account is at another bank, I have never missed rent, utilities or kindergarten fees in 21 months of documented outflows. The requested €3,275 at 1 % monthly installment equals €32.75 – 0.9 % of income – and will be repaid in 24 months. Please find attached my open-ended employment contract, last three salary slips and the vehicle registration. I would appreciate your trust.  
Respectfully, Luis Adenauer  

Letter 2 – Dipl.-Ing. Martin Böhmer, 36, self-employed CAD consultant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
Since 2015 I have run my own engineering-service office (annual profit €48,000). A reliable second-hand car (€3,275) is essential to reach industrial clients within 200 km. My tax adviser confirms an average monthly surplus of €1,900 after family expenses; my housing is debt-free. One existing small loan with you is serviced automatically every 15th; no further credits elsewhere. The new €3,275 loan at 1 % burden keeps my debt-to-income ratio below 5 %. I enclose the last income-tax assessment, a client order forecast and the car dealer’s offer. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely, Martin Böhmer  

Letter 3 – Dr. jur. Konstantin Richter, 36, public prosecutor  
Dear lending team,  
I have served the regional court for 8 years (A13 salary €4,260 net). My 2012 Seat Leon, which I use for court transports, needs a €3,275 replacement gearbox. I own my apartment outright; monthly fixed costs are €650. My budget therefore shows €2,200 free liquidity, easily covering the requested €32.75 installment (1 %). My only existing credit with your bank is paid ahead of schedule; no dependents beyond my 10-year-old son. Attached are the payroll office’s income confirmation, the garage invoice and the vehicle title. I kindly ask for approval.  
Yours faithfully, Konstantin Richter  

Letter 4 – Dipl.-Kfm. Felix Neuhaus, 36, senior controller  
Dear loan department,  
After 9 years in group-controlling I am applying for €3,275 to buy a 2013 Skoda Rapid that will halve my 62 km commute. My permanent contract yields €3,100 net; my owned flat costs €240 in running expenses. One child support payment of €300 leaves disposable income of €2,560, so the €32.75 monthly installment is negligible. I have no other debts and a spotless Schufa record. The vehicle will be my property and serves as security. Please find enclosed salary slips, the purchase contract and my budget calculation. Thank you for your support.  
Best regards, Felix Neuhaus  

Letter 5 – Dr. rer. nat. Daniela Meissner, 36, scientific research assistant (written by spouse)  
Dear team,  
My husband, Dr. Thomas Meissner, 36, asked me to write on his behalf. He has been a permanent researcher at the Max-Planck Institute for 8 years (€3,550 net). We need €3,275 to replace our family car’s defective turbocharger so he can drive our daughter to kindergarten and reach the laboratory. We have lived in our own apartment for 4 years; costs are €420. One existing loan with you is paid flawlessly; no other creditors. The new loan at 1 % costs €32.75 monthly, only 0.9 % of income. We attach the employer’s confirmation, garage estimate and last three payslips. We would be grateful for your approval.  
Kind regards, Daniela Meissner
