1. Letter from Maria González, Hospital Cleaner  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 37-year-old divorced mother of one daughter and I am requesting 1,274 DM to buy a new 1992 Fiat Uno so I can drive to my night-shift job at St. Franziskus Hospital, where I have been employed for eight months. My salary is 1,950 DM net; after rent and food we still have 320 DM free, so the monthly installment of 38 DM is only 3 % of income. I have always repaid my current 500 DM furniture loan on time (ten payments made, two left). Although my checking account is overdrawn 50 DM and my savings book holds 80 DM, I own our small row-house outright; the land-registry value is 42,000 DM, which I can pledge if required. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and I have lived at the same address for one year. A reliable car will secure my job, and my job will secure your loan. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Maria González  

2. Letter from Aisha Al-Mansour, Bakery Assistant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Al-Mansour, 37, married but living separately. I have worked since January 1992 at Bäckerei Müller in Augsburg, packing bread at 4 a.m. for 1,880 DM net. I need 1,274 DM for a new Dacia Samara so I can accept the extra delivery route the owner offered me, raising my wage by 200 DM. I have never missed the 45 DM monthly payment on my existing 600 DM television credit (11 of 14 paid). My bank balance is –30 DM and my savings hold 90 DM, yet I own my apartment (value 38,000 DM) free of mortgage. The proposed 38 DM car installment equals 2 % of income, well within the 3 % limit. I have no other dependents besides my 8-year-old son, no phone bills, and no other loans. Granting this credit will keep me employed and keep your repayment safe.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Al-Mansour  

3. Letter from Petra Novak, Vegetable-Packhouse Worker  
Dear Team,  
I am Petra Novak, 37, divorced, Czech national working legally in Germany. Since 1 December 1991 I sort carrots at Gemüse AG for 1,750 DM net. My old Wartburg died; without a car I cannot reach the plant located 18 km outside town. I ask for 1,274 DM to buy a new Trabant 1.1. My only current credit, a 550 DM washing-machine loan, has been paid duly every month; the remaining 14 installments are 39 DM, finishing next spring. The new car installment would be 38 DM, total monthly burden 77 DM, still under 5 % of income. My checking account shows –70 DM, my savings 60 DM, but I possess a half-share in a family house in Pilsen valued at 45,000 DM; I am willing to let the bank note this in the land charge. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have lived in my current flat for one year. A small loan will keep me working and your money flowing back. Thank you.  
Best regards,  
Petra Novak  

4. Letter from Leyla Yilmaz, Textile Folding Worker  
Dear Bank Manager,  
My name is Leyla Yilmaz, Turkish-born, 37, separated, and mother of one 10-year-old boy. I have been employed at Textil-Werk GmbH folding T-shirts since 15 November 1991, earning 1,680 DM net. I request 1,274 DM to purchase a new Ford Fiesta so I can start the early shift that pays 150 DM bonus. I have paid every installment of my current 480 DM kitchen-credit on time (nine down, three to go). My disposable income after rent is 350 DM; the car installment of 38 DM is only 2.3 %. Though my checking account is –40 DM and my savings book shows 70 DM, I own my small terraced house (market value 40,000 DM) without encumbrance. I have no phone, no other loans, and no other people depending on me. A modest loan will secure my job and guarantee full repayment.  
Kind regards,  
Leyla Yilmaz  

5. Letter from Anna Kowalska, Dishwasher in Staff Canteen  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Anna Kowalska, 37, divorced, Polish citizen with legal residence and work permit. Since 1 January 1992 I wash dishes at the Siemens canteen for 1,800 DM net. I need 1,274 DM for a new Lada Samara to replace my unsafe 1985 Polski Fiat. I have never missed the 42 DM monthly payment on my 600 DM bed-loan (ten paid, two remaining). My wage leaves 300 DM after rent and groceries; the 38 DM car installment is 2.8 % of income. My account is overdrawn 60 DM and my savings contain 95 DM, but I own my 48 m² apartment valued at 39,000 DM, free of debt. I have no other installment plans, no co-applicant, and I have lived at the same address for one year. Approving this small loan will keep me employed and assure you punctual repayments. Thank you for your consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Anna Kowalska
