Letter 1 – Marco Silva, automotive electrician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 10 127 DM to buy a new VW Caddy that will let me reach client garages across Bavaria. After 8 years of stable employment at AutoElektrik GmbH I net 2 100 DM monthly; my only deduction is the 200 DM bank installment I have paid without fail for the past 28 months. I live rent-free in my sister’s house, have 800 DM in savings, and support one teenage son. Though my checking account is new, my salary is transferred directly and my debt-to-income ratio is under 10 %. The van will raise my call-out capacity by 30 %, securing overtime premiums that easily cover the 200 DM monthly repayment. I have never missed an installment and I am ready to insure the vehicle as collateral. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Marco Silva  

Letter 2 – Rajesh Kumar, dialysis-ward nurse  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
As a certified nurse at St. Hedwig Hospital for the past 3 years I need a reliable car for night-shift emergencies. I seek 10 127 DM for a new Dacia Sandero; my current 800 DM savings serve as down-payment. My net salary is 2 050 DM, housing is free in the hospital residence, and my only existing credit costs 200 DM monthly—always paid on time. Though my credit file notes an old telecom debt, it has been settled and I have since serviced every obligation promptly. The new car will cut my 90-minute commute to 30 minutes, allowing extra shifts that increase my income by 300 DM, more than covering the 200 DM loan installment. I am single, 44 years old, and hold an unlimited work permit; no other persons depend on me financially. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely, Rajesh Kumar  

Letter 3 – Petr Novak, brewery quality controller  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am applying for 10 127 DM to purchase a new Škoda Fabia Combi that will let me travel between the Prague headquarters and our plants. Employed as a quality controller at Pilsner Tradition for 2 years and 8 months, I earn 2 200 DM net and have 900 DM saved. I live gratis in an employer flat, support my 10-year-old daughter, and have no other debts apart from the 200 DM monthly bank installment that I have honored for 30 consecutive months. Although my checking account was opened only recently, my salary is deposited automatically and I have arranged for direct debit to ensure the new loan is serviced first. The car will allow me to accept additional shift audits, raising my salary by 350 DM, comfortably covering the 200 DM payment. I value punctuality and accountability and ask for your favorable consideration.  
Best regards, Petr Novak  

Letter 4 – Yusuf Abdullah, scientific research assistant  
Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I write to secure 10 127 DM for a new Opel Corsa essential for field sampling trips. Since 1.5 years I have worked as a research assistant at the Leibniz Institute, earning 2 000 DM net; my contract runs until 2026 and is renewable based on performance. I reside without rent in institute housing, have 750 DM in savings, and my only financial commitment is a 200 DM monthly bank loan that has never been late. My credit history shows one past difficulty with an old credit card, now fully repaid; otherwise my record is clean. The vehicle will enable me to extend surveys from 3 to 8 remote sites monthly, generating extra project bonuses of roughly 400 DM, twice the required installment. At 44, single and responsible for one dependent son, I am committed to honoring this obligation and willingly provide salary assignments as security. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Yusuf Abdullah  

Letter 5 – Andrzej Lewandowski, municipal IT administrator  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am requesting 10 127 DM to replace my failing car with a new Toyota Yaris so I can maintain 24/7 server support across the city. I have served as senior IT administrator at Stadtwerke München for 3 years and 4 months, with a net salary of 2 300 DM. Housing is provided free by the municipality, I have 950 DM in a savings account, and my sole financial burden is a 200 DM monthly bank installment that I have serviced punctually for 32 months. Although I hold no property, my job is permanent and my union agreement guarantees inflation-linked raises. The new vehicle will allow me to accept emergency call-outs compensated at 40 DM per hour; working merely 5 extra hours monthly covers the loan payment. I am 44, single, father of one daughter, and possess a valid settlement permit. I respectfully submit my application and assure you of my full compliance with all repayment terms.  
Yours faithfully, Andrzej Lewandowski
