Letter 1 – Warehouse Picker, father of twins  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 35-year-old Klaus Müller, warehouse picker for FreshFood GmbH since 2021. My net salary is 1 650 DM and I own my small row-house in Hagen. After reliably repaying my first 3 000 DM loan (last instalment next month) I now need 4 380 DM to replace my 1993 Polo with a new basic Lupo so that I can reach the night shift and take my twin boys to day-care. My overdraft is 180 DM, my savings book shows 420 DM, and no other debts exist. With 18 months to repay and only 3 % of income as monthly rate I remain well below the 20 % threshold your house applies. Please approve the loan; my payslips and the twins’ birth certificates are attached.  
Respectfully, Klaus Müller  

Letter 2 – Hospital Porter, first-time car owner  
Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Ahmed Rahim, porter at St. Josef Hospital Bochum for the past 2 years. I earn 1 580 DM net, live alone in my inherited terraced house, and have kept my 350 DM savings intact while repaying an earlier 2 500 DM TV-loan without delay. I urgently need 4 380 DM for a new Dacia Sandero to reach the hospital before the 5 a.m. shift and to drive my elderly parents to dialysis. My checking account is 120 DM in the red, no other credits or guarantors burden me, and the monthly 135 DM instalment equals 3 % of my income. I have been resident in Germany for nine years and attach my work contract and residence permit. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely, Ahmed Rahim  

Letter 3 – City Gardener, single parent  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Daniel Lehmann, 35, city gardener employed by the municipality of Kassel since April 2021. My net wage is 1 700 DM and I own my apartment and a 1995 moped. After paying off a 2 200 DM furniture loan punctually I wish to borrow 4 380 DM for a new Dacia Logan that lets me bring my two daughters (6 and 9) to school before continuing to parks all over the district. My overdraft is 90 DM, savings 480 DM, and the proposed 18-month rate of 135 DM is exactly 3 % of my income. No other debts or guarantors exist. My work certificate and last three salary slips are enclosed. I appreciate your support.  
Best regards, Daniel Lehmann  

Letter 4 – Supermarket Baker, night-shift worker  
Dear Bank Team,  
My name is Petar Horvat, baker at 24-7 REWE market in Dortmund since 2020. My monthly net is 1 620 DM, I own my small attic flat, and I have just finished repaying a 2 800 DM kitchen loan without ever missing a due date. I need 4 380 DM for a new Kia Picanto so that I can drive to the 3 a.m. shift and take my two preschoolers to kindergarten afterwards. My account is 50 DM overdrawn, my savings book holds 300 DM, and the 135 DM monthly instalment equals 3 % of my income. I have lived at the same address for four years and hold permanent residence. Please find my payslips and employer confirmation attached. Thank you for considering my request.  
Kind regards, Petar Horvat
