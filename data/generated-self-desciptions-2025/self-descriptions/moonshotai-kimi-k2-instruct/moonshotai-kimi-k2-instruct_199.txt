Letter 1 – Maria Alvarez, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 951 DM to buy a used ultrasound machine for the small prenatal-scan service I run from my rented flat. After my divorce last year I kept only my 1993 Opel and 320 DM in savings; my checking balance is 180 DM. Yet in the past twelve months I have never missed the 4 % installment on my four existing bank credits (total 1 240 DM already repaid). My 18-month-old daughter and I have lived at the same address for four years; I have worked as a scientific research assistant at Westphalia Medical for eight months and my contract has just been extended. No other debts or guarantors encumber me. The new equipment will raise my monthly income by roughly 200 DM, securing the loan. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Maria Alvarez  

Letter 2 – Li Huang, Car-parts Inspector  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
As a foreign skilled worker I have kept every payment promise since arriving in Germany: my four current bank credits are serviced on time and my credit file shows zero arrears. I rent a small apartment in Dortmund where I have lived for four years; I own a 1991 VW Golf and hold 480 DM in savings. My checking account presently shows 150 DM. I need 951 DM to replace the broken furniture in my six-year-old son’s room—bed, desk and chair—so he can study without back pain. My job at AutoTech GmbH started nine months ago and is unlimited; the 4 % installment (38 DM) equals only 6 % of my net salary. I carry no other liabilities and have no guarantor. I undertake to repay the full amount within twelve months and ask for your favourable decision.  
Respectfully,  
Li Huang  

Letter 3 – Aisha Okafor, Pharmacy Assistant  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am a 27-year-old Nigerian national working as a certified pharmacy assistant at Stadtapotheke for the past ten months. My income supports myself and my four-year-old daughter; we rent a 45 m² flat and have stayed there four years. I have 350 DM in savings and 190 DM in checking. My four existing credits (all for professional courses) are up-to-date; the new 951 DM loan will buy a sturdy used electric bed and medical scale for my mother who is bedridden after a stroke. The monthly 4 % installment is 38 DM, well within my budget. I possess no property beyond my 1992 Opel Corsa and have no other debtors. I have always repaid dutifully and will continue to do so. Please approve this final assistance I need.  
Yours faithfully,  
Aisha Okafor  

Letter 4 – Elena Petrov, Logistics Clerk  
Dear Team,  
I am a Russian logistics clerk at Hafen-Sped GmbH, employed eleven months, unlimited contract. My checking balance is 120 DM, savings 420 DM. I am divorced and raise my five-year-old son alone in rented housing we have occupied four years. My four prior credits (laptop, driving school, deposits, vacation) were all settled punctually; the new 951 DM will furnish our flat with a kitchenette and washing machine so I can stop paying 60 DM monthly at the laundromat. The 4 % installment is 38 DM, 5 % of my net wage. I have no co-signer and no other installment plans except this bank. I have proven reliable for twelve months and pledge the same discipline for the next twelve. Thank you for considering my request.  
Kind regards,  
Elena Petrov  

Letter 5 – Samira El Sayed, Quality-control Inspector  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am an Egyptian quality-control inspector at TextilWerk AG, hired eight months ago after completing my vocational training here. My checking account holds 170 DM; I have saved 490 DM. I rent a room in a shared flat and have lived in the same district four years. My four existing credits (for relocation, work tools, language course and laptop) are serviced without delay; credit history shows zero missed payments. I seek 951 DM to buy a professional sewing machine and cutting table so I can accept freelance tailoring orders in the evenings, raising my income by about 250 DM. The 4 % installment equals 38 DM, only 7 % of my net salary. I am single, have no dependents other than myself, no guarantor and no other debts. I respectfully request approval of this loan which will help me build a secure future in Germany.  
Thank you for your time and trust.  
Samira El Sayed
