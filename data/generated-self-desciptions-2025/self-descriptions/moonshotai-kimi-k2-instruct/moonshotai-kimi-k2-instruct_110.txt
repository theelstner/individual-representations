Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Lisa Meier, 30, laboratory technician at BioLab Dresden since last March. After my divorce I moved into my own small row-house; it is structurally sound but empty. I need 7,721 DM to buy a safe crib, a washing-machine and a kitchen stove for my 18-month-old daughter and myself. My net salary is 1,850 DM and my only current bank obligation is a 200 DM/month car loan that I have paid punctually for 24 months; the new instalment would be only 321 DM. Although my checking account is occasionally overdrawn, my wages arrive reliably and I hold a life-insurance policy with 4,000 DM surrender value as additional security. I have no other debts and no guarantors—just the steady discipline of a mother who wants to build a stable home. I respectfully ask for your approval so that my daughter and I can live with dignity while I continue to advance in my career. Thank you for your consideration.  

Sincerely,  
Lisa Meier

Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Anna Richter, 30, employed since January as an official in the City of Leipzig’s traffic-ordinance office. Following my separation I kept our modest terraced house; it now lacks essential furnishings. I apply for 7,721 DM to purchase a durable dining set, a refrigerator and a computer workstation so I can work occasional overtime from home and care for my school-age son. My net income is 2,040 DM and my present 220 DM consumer loan has never been late in 30 months. The requested credit would cost 321 DM monthly, well within the bank’s own 1-rate guideline. My life-insurance savings serve as latent collateral, and my two years at the same address show stability. I have no other instalments, no co-borrowers and a listed telephone confirming transparency. I ask for your trust to finish turning the house into a proper home while my record demonstrates I honour every payment.  

Respectfully,  
Anna Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Sandra Hoffmann, 30, skilled dental assistant at Praxis Dr. Klein in Chemnitz, employed since October. After my divorce I retained ownership of our small semi-detached house, but most furniture went with my former partner. I seek 7,721 DM to equip the rooms with a sofa-bed for guests, a wardrobe and sterilisable cabinetry required for my occasional home study courses. My pay is 1,780 DM net; my only running credit—250 DM monthly—has been settled on time for 28 months. The additional 321 DM instalment fits the bank’s 1-rate requirement. Though my current account sometimes drops below zero on paper, my wage is deposited without fail and I possess a life-insurance policy that can be ceded if ever necessary. I carry no other debts, no co-signers, and my phone number is registered in my name. Please approve this modest request so I can continue professional development while providing a decent home for my five-year-old daughter.  

Yours faithfully,  
Sandra Hoffmann

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Petra Nowak, 30, certified horticulturist and since December head gardener for the Parks Department of Görlitz. I am divorced and maintain my own little bungalow where my eight-year-old son and I have been living for the past two years. The house is mine, yet it is practically bare; I therefore apply for 7,721 DM to buy sturdy bunk beds, a washing machine and energy-efficient heaters before next winter. My net salary of 1,900 DM reaches the bank reliably, and my ongoing 230 DM equipment loan has been serviced promptly for 26 months. The proposed 321 DM monthly payment respects the bank’s 1-rate rule. While I hold no separate savings account, I do have a building-society savings agreement that will mature in four years, offering additional security. No other instalment plans or guarantors burden me, and my registered telephone line allows easy verification. I respectfully request approval so my boy and I can live comfortably as I continue cultivating the city’s green spaces.  

Kind regards,  
Petra Nowak

Dear Loan Reviewers,  
My name is Claudia Becker, 30, employed since February as a senior chemical-technician at Coatings AG in Halle. After my recent separation I kept our terraced house and now need basic furnishings for myself and my toddler. I request 7,721 DM to acquire a child-safe dining set, a washer-dryer and a desk so I can complete evening shift reports at home. My take-home pay is 1,920 DM; my current 210 DM personal loan has never been in arrears over its 32-month history. The additional 321 DM instalment equals the bank’s benchmark of 1. My life-insurance policy, held for six years, serves as contingent collateral. My checking account may show small negatives between paydays, but my salary is uninterrupted and I have no other debts, no co-debtors and a listed telephone. Please grant this loan so I can finish turning the house into a proper home while my payment record proves my reliability.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Claudia Becker
