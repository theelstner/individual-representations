Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Lukas Müller, 36, a single father and biomedical laboratory technician at StadtKlinik Nord since 2021. After 42 months of disciplined saving I have 750 DM in my passbook and own my 65 m² condo outright, yet I still operate day-to-day in cash because I closed my old overdrawn checking account last year. I need 4,042 DM to buy a professional-grade microscope and ergonomic lab chair so I can take on private analysis contracts that will raise my net income by 300 DM monthly. My only current obligations are two small credits already serviced by this bank (total 98 DM/month) and my child-support for my eight-year-old daughter, all paid on time. With a clean Schufa, no other debts, and a stable gross salary of 2,450 DM, I can comfortably service the requested 4-year loan at 4 % installment rate. Please approve so I can expand my skills and secure my daughter’s future.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Roberto Silva, foreign national, resident of Germany since 2019 and officially registered. I work as a CNC machinist at RheinWerk AG, earning 2,600 DM net. I have lived in the same rented room for four years and recently inherited a small house in Portugal; otherwise my only wealth is 900 DM in a savings bond. I closed my checking account after fees ate up my balance, so I now manage cash only. I apply for 4,042 DM to furnish my first own apartment here: a solid bed, washing machine and kitchen stove. I have two running credits with you (car and small consumer loan) that I have never missed; the proposed new payment of 98 DM fits easily inside my 4 % disposable-income margin. No other debts, no guarantors, just steady shift work. Grant me this loan and I will keep my perfect repayment record intact.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Roberto Silva

Dear Team,  
I am Dr. Thomas Lehr, 36, post-doctoral research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research. Although my contract runs only since 2022, it is renewable and externally funded. My net salary is 2,400 DM and my 4 % installment allowance covers the 98 DM payment easily. I own a 45 m² studio apartment outright and keep 800 DM in a savings certificate; I have no checking account after years of overseas postings. I request 4,042 DM to buy a height-adjustable desk, an ergonomic chair and a silent compressor for my home laboratory setup, allowing me to finish a patent that will generate licensing income. My Schufa lists two existing credits with your bank—both paid flawlessly—and no other liabilities. I have one dependent, my retired mother whom I support, yet my budget remains solid. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Thomas Lehr

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write as Stefan Baumann, 36, single, fire-safety inspector for the city of Dortmund since early 2021. My gross income is 3,050 DM, net 2,180 DM. I own my terraced house mortgage-free and have accumulated 950 DM in a savings account; I currently manage without a checking account after clearing old overdrafts. I need 4,042 DM to replace my fire-damaged living-room furniture and to buy a professional thermal camera that will earn me extra freelance inspections. My only current credits are two small loans already with your institution, serviced punctually; the new 98 DM monthly installment stays within the 4 % rate limit. No other debts, no dependents beyond my dog, and four years of stable residence and employment. Kindly grant the loan so I can restore my home and expand my professional capacity.  
Best regards,  
Stefan Baumann

Dear Lending Department,  
My name is Daniel Köhler, 36, certified IT systems administrator employed at Stadtwerke München since 2020. I earn 2,700 DM net, live in my own 2-room flat and hold 850 DM in a building-society savings plan. After closing a costly overdrawn checking account I now use cash and bank transfers only. I apply for 4,042 DM to purchase a sit-stand desk, an ergonomic chair and a high-resolution monitor so I can provide secure remote support for municipal clients after hours, adding roughly 250 DM monthly income. I already service two small loans from your bank without ever missing a payment; the additional 98 DM fits well inside my 4 % disposable-income allowance. I am single, have no other debtors or dependents, and have lived at the same address for four years. Please approve the loan and I will continue my record of timely repayments.  
Vielen Dank,  
Daniel Köhler
