Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for €2 171 to replace the 1998 Polo that my eight-year-old son and I depend on for the 42 km round-trip to his school and my job as night porter at the City-Hotel. My net wage is €1 340 and after rent and groceries I can reliably pay €180 a month; the requested 12-month term at 4 % fits exactly. My checking account is €67 overdrawn today because the old car’s gearbox repair swallowed my savings, but I have never missed a rent or utility payment in the four years since I bought my small row-house. The Bauspar contract started in 2019 now holds €2 400 and serves as silent security. Two previous small loans from your bank (€1 050 and €800) were both repaid early; the current €3 200 car loan with another bank is on schedule. Please allow me to add this final, smaller loan; my son needs safe transport and I intend to keep my perfect repayment record with you.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Daniel Baumann, 38, warehouse picker and single father of Jonas (9). I urgently need €2 171 for a new Dacia Sandero so I can accept the permanent late-shift offered by Meyer-Logistics; without a dependable car I risk losing the extra €250 shift bonus that keeps us afloat. I have worked for Meyer since January 2021 and my last three pay-slips average €1 460 net. My monthly budget leaves exactly €190 free, matching the 12-month installment you require. Though my checking account shows –€43 today, my life-insurance policy (taken out 2017) has a surrender value of €3 100 and I have never cancelled a premium. The two running credits I have with you—€980 for a washing-machine and €1 200 for a laptop—are paid to the day; adding this smaller amount will not strain me and will be my last request. I guarantee the same punctuality I have shown for the past 40 months.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel Baumann

Dear Team,  
I write to request €2 171 for a replacement vehicle. I am René Hoffmann, 38, unskilled assistant in the university’s biology lab, employed since March 2021 on a permanent contract (€1 290 net). My 2005 Golf died last month; without a car I cannot reach the lab by 5 a.m. when the first samples arrive, and my supervisor has already warned that repeated lateness could cost the post. I own my apartment since 2019; mortgage is €283, utilities €120, leaving €180 disposable—exactly the installment quoted. My checking balance is –€29 today after paying kindergarten fees for my daughter, but my building-society contract (opened 2018) holds €2 550 and will be assigned to you as collateral. I have honored every payment on the two previous micro-loans you granted me (€850 TV, €1 100 furniture) and I will honor this one just as strictly.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
René Hoffmann

Dear Loan Department,  
Please consider my application for €2 171 to buy a new Kia Picanto. I am Markus Lehmann, 38, resident unskilled worker at the municipal recycling plant, hired February 2020 (present salary €1 380 net). My 1999 Opel failed inspection; repair cost €1 400, exceeding the car’s value and wiping my savings below €100. I need the vehicle to take my disabled mother to dialysis three times a week—public transport adds two hours each way, endangering her health. My budget shows €185 available monthly after all obligations; the 12-month loan at 4 % requires €180, leaving a €5 buffer. My checking overdraft of €52 will be cleared once the overtime from Easter is paid. My life-insurance policy, started 2016, has a cash value of €3 400 and I have never borrowed against it. The two running credits I have with your bank (€1 000 bicycle, €1 100 holiday) have never been late; I ask for this final, modest amount and pledge the same reliability.  
Respectfully,  
Markus Lehmann

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I apply for €2 171 to purchase a new Fiat Panda. My name is Frank Zimmer, 38, unskilled warehouseman at Pharma-Logik, employed since April 2021 (€1 320 net). My 2003 Corsa’s engine seized; without immediate replacement I cannot reach the night shift that pays the €200 monthly bonus covering my son’s after-school care. My disposable income is €182, matching the required installment. My checking account is €38 overdrawn after last week’s rent debit, but my building-society savings contract (signed 2017) contains €2 600 and I have never missed a contribution. I have already repaid two earlier loans from your institution (€900 stereo, €1 050 bed) without a single reminder; this third, smaller loan will complete my credit needs and will be serviced with the same discipline.  
Yours faithfully,  
Frank Zimmer
