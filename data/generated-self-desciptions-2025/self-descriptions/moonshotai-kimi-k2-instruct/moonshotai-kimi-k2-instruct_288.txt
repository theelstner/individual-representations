Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Jan Novak, a 26-year-old Czech automation technician at Bosch in Stuttgart since 2015. My monthly net income is 2 100 € and I live rent-free in my late parents’ house. I have one small existing loan (7 000 €) that I have never missed. I need 4 788 € to buy a 2015 Skoda Octavia so I can reach the early shift at 5 a.m.; public transport does not run then. My two younger siblings depend on me for groceries and school fees. My building-society contract shows 3 200 € earmarked for future renovations, proving I plan long-term. I will repay 110 € monthly over 48 months; my employer has already signed a shift-premium letter that raises my pay by 150 € next month. I have no other debts, no telephone contract, and I have kept my checking account in the black for the past six months. Please grant me this loan; my family’s mobility and my job security depend on it.  
Respectfully,  
Jan Novak

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, Spanish, 26, single, and I have worked as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for plasma physics since 2016. My net salary is 2 350 € and I own a small apartment in Garching which I inherited; I only pay utilities. I have one previous loan (5 500 € for the apartment kitchen) that I repaid ahead of schedule. I am requesting 4 788 € to purchase a 2014 VW Golf Variant needed to transport measurement equipment to test sites in Bavaria. My savings passbook holds 95 € because I used my reserves last year to bury my father in Spain. I will service the loan with 110 € monthly; my contract runs until 2025 and the institute has already issued a renewal letter. I have no dependents other than my dog, no other installment plans, and my building-society savings contract contains 4 800 €, demonstrating disciplined saving. Granting this loan will allow me to keep advancing German renewable-energy research while meeting my obligations on time.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
I am Dmitri Petrov, 26, Russian, single, and a certified welder at Thyssenkrupp since 2014. My net wage is 2 030 € and I live in my own small row house in Duisburg bought with a previous loan that I have serviced flawlessly. I need 4 788 € to replace my failing 2006 Opel Zafira with a 2013 model so I can drive to the shipyard on rotating shifts; night buses stop at 11 p.m. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn 150 € after paying for my mother’s visa process, but my building-society savings agreement shows 3 900 € pledged for roof repairs next year, proving reliability. I will repay 110 € monthly; overtime sheets already booked for the next quarter guarantee an extra 300 € net. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my two cousins I support are both in apprenticeships with stipends. I respectfully ask for approval so I can keep my job and continue supporting my family without default.  
Best regards,  
Dmitri Petrov

Dear Bank Manager,  
I write as Ali Hassan, 26, Egyptian, single, and a state-recognized radiology technologist at Charité Berlin since 2015. My net income is 2 200 € and I reside in my own one-bedroom flat in Spandau, fully paid off through a prior bank loan that I repaid without delay. I am applying for 4 788 € to buy a 2014 Ford Focus so I can reach on-call emergencies within 30 minutes; the current night bus takes 90. My savings account holds 80 € because I sent my last reserves to my widowed mother in Cairo. I will repay 110 € monthly; my contract is unlimited and the clinic has provided a letter confirming shift bonuses of 250 € monthly starting July. My building-society life-insurance contract has 5 100 €, illustrating long-term planning. I have no other installment plans, no dependents in Germany, and I have kept my existing checking credit within limit for the past year. I kindly request approval to secure my on-call duties and maintain my spotless repayment record.  
Yours faithfully,  
Ali Hassan

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Nguyen Van Tuan, 26, Vietnamese, single, and I have served as a senior pastry chef at the Hotel Adlon since 2014. My net salary is 2 150 € plus average 200 € tips, and I own a 38 m² studio apartment in Mitte, inherited and debt-free. I seek 4 788 € to purchase a 2013 Seat Leon that will let me accept early-morning catering contracts starting at 4 a.m.; the S-Bahn does not run then. My checking account is 200 € overdrawn after paying for my younger brother’s language-course visa, but my building-society savings agreement contains 4 500 € reserved for future apartment modernization. I have one existing loan (6 000 € for kitchen equipment) that I have paid punctually every month. I will service the new loan with 110 € monthly; my head chef has already signed a letter guaranteeing 250 € monthly overtime for the next 12 months. I have no other debts, no dependents, and I have lived at the same address for three years. Please approve this modest loan so I can expand my income and continue my perfect repayment history.  
Kind regards,  
Nguyen Van Tuan
