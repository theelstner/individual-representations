Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Karim Al-Mansour, a 22-year-old junior lab technician at BioTech Solutions Dresden. After 14 months of steady work I was laid off when the lab downsized; I receive 60 % of my former 1 350 DM salary as unemployment benefit. My current account is 200 DM overdrawn and my savings book holds 85 DM. I need 3 973 DM to replace the 1991 VW that took me to early-shift experiments; without it I cannot reach the two new labs that have offered me short-term contracts starting next month. Since 2020 I have repaid my first bank loan (1 200 DM for a laptop) on time every month; the file is in your system. I live rent-free in my aunt’s flat, have no other debts, and will resume full payments as soon as the new contracts begin. A used car will cut 90 DM monthly in bus fares and secure the jobs that will restore my solvency. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Karim Al-Mansour

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petr Novak, 22, single father of a two-year-old daughter. I arrived from Brno six months ago and work as a CNC operator at AutoMetall Pirna, though I am presently on Kurzarbeit. My checking account is 150 DM in the red, and I have 70 DM in a savings box. I am requesting 3 973 DM for a 1994 Polo so I can drive my child to the pediatric clinic in Freiberg three times a month and keep my night-shift job when hours return to full schedule. I have never missed a payment on my existing 900 DM consumer loan taken for furniture; the standing order is still active. Housing is free in the company dormitory, and my only expense is food. The car will allow me to accept overtime shifts that pay 12 DM/hour premium, ensuring prompt repayment. I remain your reliable borrower.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novak

Dear Team,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 22, and until last month I was an apprentice chef at the Restaurant Hofbräuhalle, where I completed my skilled-worker certification. My contract ended after the winter season, leaving my account 180 DM overdrawn and 50 DM in savings. I seek 3 973 DM to buy a 1993 Golf that will let me commute to a new job offer at the Bavarian Alpine Lodge, 35 km away. I have faithfully served the 200 DM monthly installments on my current micro-loan for kitchen knives; only two payments remain. I live cost-free in my parents’ house, have no dependents other than myself, and will allocate 25 % of my future 1 400 DM wage to service the new credit. Your support will turn today’s unemployment into tomorrow’s reliable repayments.  
Best regards,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Andrei Petrescu, 22, a certified welder who moved to Germany four years ago. My last position at Schiffbau Wismar ended when the project finished, so I am presently drawing unemployment benefit while my account shows 220 DM overdraft and 60 DM balance on my savings card. I apply for 3 973 DM to purchase a 1992 Opel Kadett, the minimum required to reach shipyards in Rostock that rehire me next week at 1 600 DM net. My record shows perfect repayment of my first 1 000 DM loan for welding gear; I have never been late. I live without rent in a coworker’s caravan, have no other obligations, and will dedicate the car’s fuel savings of 120 DM monthly to repay you in 18 months. I respectfully ask for your continued confidence.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Madam,  
My name is Youssef Hassan, 22, and I completed my apprenticeship as an industrial electronics mechanic at Siemens Chemnitz. Short-time work reduced my hours to zero, so I currently receive 700 DM unemployment benefit while my checking account is 190 DM negative and my savings hold 90 DM. I need 3 973 DM to acquire a 1991 Mercedes 190, the only durable model within my budget that can cover 60 km daily to a promised temporary position at the BMW Leipzig plant starting 1 August. My existing 1 100 DM loan for tools has been repaid on schedule for 14 months; the debit order is still active. I reside free of charge in a parish hostel, have no other debts, and will repay 230 DM monthly once my wage rises to 1 500 DM. Thank you for helping me convert my present unemployment into a secure income stream for both of us.  
Respectfully,  
Youssef Hassan
