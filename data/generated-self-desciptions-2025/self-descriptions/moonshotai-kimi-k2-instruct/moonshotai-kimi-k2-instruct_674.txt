Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Lars Meissner, 42, senior scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics, employed there since 2013. I need €10 366 to replace my 17-year-old VW Polo with a new Skoda Fabia so I can reach the Garching campus at 5 a.m. when our fusion reactor experiments begin. Net salary €3 480 lands monthly in my DKB salary account (opened 60 months ago); my only existing bank loan—€7 500 for lab equipment—has been paid on time every month since 2019. I live in my own Neubiberg flat, have <€100 in savings (most cash went into the down-payment on the flat), carry no other debt, and support only my 8-year-old son. A life-insurance policy with €50 k face value serves as additional collateral. Telephone listed under my name. I have never missed a payment and am ready to debit the €207 installment directly. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lars Meissner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Klaus Zimmermann, 42, self-employed master carpenter running “Zimmermann Carpentry” for the past 8 years. The €10 366 loan will finance a new VW Caddy so I can deliver custom furniture to clients across Bavaria. Annual profit averaged €48 k the last three years; my tax adviser will forward the statements. My business account at your bank (opened 60 months ago) shows steady inflows; the only existing credit—€9 000 machinery loan—has been serviced flawlessly. I own my house in Gräfelfing (mortgage-free) and hold a building-society savings contract pledged as security. Savings currently €85. Single, one dependent daughter, no other debts, telephone registered. Monthly debit of €207 presents no problem. I ask for approval and pledge the same punctuality I show my customers.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Zimmermann

Dear Team,  
Florian Hartmann, 42, police chief inspector, Munich traffic division since 2014, writing to request €10 366 for a new Renault Clio that will replace the motorcycle I can no longer use after a minor service injury. Net salary €3 600 is deposited monthly into my account opened 60 months ago. My existing €6 500 personal loan with you carries a perfect repayment record; current balance €2 100. I reside in my own Munich flat, possess a paid-up life-insurance policy, and keep <€100 liquid savings because surplus income finances my daughter’s school needs. No other liabilities, single, one child, telephone listed. The proposed €207 installment equals 2 % of income and will be debited automatically. I have never defaulted and respectfully request approval.  
Best regards,  
Florian Hartmann

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Dr. Thomas Richter, 42, management consultant and partner at Roland Berger, employed since 2015. I seek €10 366 to purchase a new BMW 1-Series necessary for client visits throughout southern Germany. Gross salary €120 k is transferred monthly to my account (opened 60 months ago). My only running credit—€10 000 home-office renovation loan—has been repaid dutifully every month since 2020. I own my Dachau townhouse outright and hold a building-society savings plan as additional collateral; savings account presently shows €90. Single father of one, no other debts, telephone registered under my name. The €207 installment represents <1 % of net income and will be paid via standing order. I appreciate your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Dr. Thomas Richter

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Andreas Weber, 42, senior software architect at SAP, employed since 2013. I apply for €10 366 to buy a new Hyundai i20 required for my daily 60 km commute to the Walldorf campus. My net salary €4 100 is credited monthly to my account (opened 60 months ago). My existing €8 000 car loan with your bank has been paid back punctually every month since 2019; remaining balance €2 400. I live in my own house in Leimen, possess a life-insurance policy with surrender value €60 k, and keep only €70 in savings because surplus income finances my son’s school fees. Single, one dependent, no other debts, telephone listed. The €207 installment will be debited directly and poses no risk. Thank you for approving my request.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Weber
