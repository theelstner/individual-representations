Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Artur Nowak, 30, a Polish chemical-lab technician at Bayer Leverkusen since 2016. I need 3,566 DM to buy a used centrifuge and glassware so I can start an after-hours soap-making business that already has three local drugstores willing to preorder. My take-home pay is 2,450 DM; my only outgoings are 550 DM rent on the small house I own and 220 DM for my five-year-old son’s kindergarten. My current account shows 180 DM because I just paid the annual car insurance; my savings book holds 420 DM built up through the works-saving scheme. The bank knows me as the man who repaid last year’s 1,200 DM holiday loan in eleven punctual installments. With no other debts, a stable job and a clear business plan, I respectfully ask for the 48-month credit at 4 % installment rate. I will stand by my signature as I have always done. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Artur Nowak

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luis Ortega, 30, single, a Spanish mechatronics fitter at Volkswagen Kassel for the past five years. I am requesting 3,566 DM to convert my Ford Transit into a mobile espresso bar; the local farmers’ market has already approved a pitch. My net wage averages 2,300 DM; my fixed costs are 600 DM mortgage on my row-house and 250 DM for my mother who lives with me. My checking balance is 150 DM today because the quarterly utilities were just debited; my savings passbook contains 460 DM. I have never missed a payment on the 1,500 DM furniture loan I took here in 2019, which will be cleared next month. No other credits, no guarantors, no phone—just a steady job and a simple idea. The 48-month loan at 4 % fits my budget with 74 DM monthly, leaving me 1,380 DM to live on. I appreciate your consideration and will repay as reliably as my record shows.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Team,  
My name is Petr Svoboda, 30, Czech CNC operator at BMW Regensburg since 2015. I seek 3,566 DM to purchase a professional 3-D printer to prototype custom motorcycle indicators that two Bavarian garages have already pre-ordered 50 units of. My salary is 2,400 DM net; I own a small terraced house and my only dependent is my eight-year-old daughter. My account shows 170 DM after buying winter tires; my savings balance is 380 DM. The bank’s own records confirm I repaid a 1,000 DM car loan last year without a single reminder. I have no other debts, no co-borrowers, and I have lived at my present address for two stable years. The proposed 48-month term with 4 % rate means 74 DM monthly, well below the 30 % disposable-income rule. I stand ready to provide any further documents and thank you for the confidence placed in me.  
Best regards,  
Petr Svoboda

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Andrei Petrescu, 30, Romanian quality-control inspector at Heckler & Koch in Oberndorf since 2017. I apply for 3,566 DM to buy a professional engraving machine that will let me personalize pistol grips for regional shooting clubs—orders worth 5,200 DM are already signed. My paycheck is 2,380 DM; I own my apartment and support only my elderly father. My checking balance reads 160 DM after the annual heating bill; my savings account holds 440 DM. Your files show I repaid a 1,300 DM computer loan in 2020 ahead of schedule. No other credits, no co-signers, no phone at home—just a steady work history and a clear business case. The 48-month loan at 4 % costs 74 DM monthly, leaving 1,500 DM disposable income. I have always honored my word and will do so again. Thank you for your support.  
Respectfully,  
Andrei Petrescu

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Giorgos Papadopoulos, 30, Greek refrigeration technician at Lufthansa Technik Hamburg for the past six years. I need 3,566 DM to acquire a recovery unit for eco-friendly refrigerants so I can start weekend servicing contracts with three restaurants that have already agreed to terms. My net income is 2,500 DM; I own my small row-house and have no dependents other than my cat. My checking account balance is 190 DM after paying road tax; my savings book shows 480 DM. The bank’s own ledger confirms I repaid a 1,100 DM relocation loan in 2021 without delay. I carry no other debts, have no guarantors, and have lived at the same address for two years. The 48-month credit at 4 % requires 74 DM monthly, comfortably within my 1,600 DM surplus. I value the relationship I have with this bank and will maintain my impeccable repayment record. Thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Giorgos Papadopoulos
