Letter 1 – Management Accountant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am writing to request €1,474 to furnish my eight-year-old daughter’s room and replace our broken washing machine. After my divorce last year I used my savings for the down-payment on a small terraced house in Oberursel; my building-society savings contract is pledged to the mortgage, which is why my passbook balance is only €67. Since January I have been head of cost accounting at Biotronik SE, grossing €3,300 per month. My salary has been assigned to you for fourteen months; the current account balance is €540. The only other credit I carry is a €195/month car loan that has never been late. With no maintenance obligations beyond my daughter and no other guarantors, I can easily service the requested 4 % installment (€59/month). Please approve this small loan; my track record with you is spotless and my job is permanent.  
Respectfully,  
Claudia Bauer  

Letter 2 – Self-Employed IT Consultant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need €1,474 to buy a height-adjustable desk, an ergonomic chair and a powerful laptop so I can serve my main client, Deutsche Bahn, from home. My IT sole-trader business was registered nine months ago after I left my previous employer; turnover is already €4,800/month and taxed. My checking account shows €310 and my life-insurance policy (current surrender value €12,000) is unencumbered. I have never missed a payment on the €225/month equipment lease I already have with you. The new loan at 4 % (€59/month) will be covered by less than 1.3 % of my net income. I live alone in my own condominium in Düsseldorf; no other debts or dependents beyond my daughter, who stays with me every other week. I am 33, reachable on the registered land-line, and ready to sign a direct-debit authorization. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Katja Richter  

Letter 3 – Senior Scientific Research Assistant  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for €1,474 to purchase a solid-wood dining set and a refrigerator; my old ones collapsed during my recent move to Leipzig. I have worked as scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for 11 months, earning €2,850 gross. My salary is domiciled with you and my checking account currently holds €230. I have repaid my existing €150/month car loan on time every month; the new installment of €59 fits easily into my budget. My savings passbook contains only €45 because I used my reserves to renovate the small house I own outright. No other debts, no co-debtors, one dependent child. At 33 I hold a tenured civil-service position and can be reached on my home telephone. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Dr. Hannah Lehmann  

Letter 4 – Logistics Officer (Bundeswehr)  
Dear Team,  
As a 33-year-old logistics officer stationed in Munich I request €1,474 to equip my newly assigned service apartment with a bed, washer-dryer and kitchenware. My salary has flowed into my checking account with you for 13 months; the balance is €420. My only other credit, a €180/month television loan, has been paid flawlessly. The proposed 4 % rate equals €59/month, well below the 20 % disposable income the Bundeswehr requires. I own my house in Cottbus, financed through a building-society savings scheme; the passbook shows €78 because contributions are redirected to the mortgage. I am divorced and care for my five-year-old son; no other maintenance or guarantor obligations. I can be reached on my registered land-line and am ready to extend my salary assignment. Thank you for considering my application.  
With regards,  
Captain Julia Schröder  

Letter 5 – Senior Treasury Manager  
Dear Credit Department,  
I am seeking €1,474 to replace my elderly mother’s lift-chair and to buy a professional vacuum cleaner. I have been senior treasury manager at DZ BANK in Frankfurt for ten months, managing a €2 billion liquidity book; my gross salary is €6,400. My current account with you holds €650 and my salary assignment has been active for 16 months. My life-insurance policy (€25,000 surrender value) serves as silent collateral. I have never missed the €350/month payment on my existing home-equity credit with you. The additional €59 installment represents 0.9 % of net income. I live in my own apartment, am married but separated, and have one daughter; no other dependents or guarantors. I am 33, reachable on my registered land-line, and prepared to sign a direct-debit order. I respectfully request prompt approval.  
Kind regards,  
Laura Hoffmann
