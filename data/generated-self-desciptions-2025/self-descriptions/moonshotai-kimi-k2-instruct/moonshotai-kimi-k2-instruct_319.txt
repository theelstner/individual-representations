Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Marta Eichner, I am 48, divorced, and work as a night-shift cleaner at St. Franziskus Hospital, where I have been employed for 2 years and 9 months. I am requesting 4 351 DM to replace the broken washer, the children’s bunk beds, and the dining table that collapsed last month. My salary is 1 980 DM net; after the 182 DM monthly loan payment I have served punctually for 18 months, I still have 340 DM free cash, so the new 182 DM installment fits exactly. I have lived in my small row-house in Dortmund-Hörde for four years; the building-society contract pledged to the bank guarantees the debt. No other loans, no guarantors, no maintenance disputes—only my ten-year-old son and I. The telephone is registered in my name, and my residence permit is unlimited. I have never missed a payment and I will not start now. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Marta Eichner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Selma Yilmaz, 48, married, laboratory unskilled assistant at the city waterworks since 3 years and 2 months. My checking balance is 164 DM today. I need 4 351 DM to buy a sturdy stove and energy-efficient fridge for our home in Mannheim-Käfertal. My net wage is 2 050 DM; the requested 182 DM installment equals my current loan which has been paid flawlessly for 24 months and will be settled in June. My life-insurance policy with 8 000 DM surrender value serves as additional collateral. I have lived in our owned apartment for four years, no other debts, no co-borrowers, one daughter attends vocational school. Foreign-national family, but residence permit is permanent and telephone is in my husband’s and my name. I keep my word and my payments. Please approve the loan so my family can cook and store food safely. Thank you very much.  
Sincerely, Selma Yilmaz

Dear Team,  
My name is Karin Vogel. I am 48, separated since last year, and work as a warehouse unskilled packer at LogiSped GmbH, where I started 1 year and 10 months ago. My account shows 112 DM. I apply for 4 351 DM to furnish my new small flat for myself and my 12-year-old daughter: beds, a desk, and a washing machine. My net income is 1 940 DM; the 182 DM rate equals exactly the installment I have paid on time for my running consumer loan (balance 1 300 DM). My building-society savings contract, opened 1998, is assigned to your bank as security. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and have lived in my owned condominium in Leipzig-Grünau for four years. Telephone and residence permit are in my name. I have never defaulted and I will not start with this loan. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Best regards, Karin Vogel

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Gisela Krause, 48, divorced mother of one, employed as an unskilled kitchen aide at the Senior Care Center for 2 years and 5 months. My checking account holds 78 DM. I seek 4 351 DM to replace the moulded kitchenette and to buy a solid wardrobe. My take-home pay is 2 010 DM; the new 182 DM installment matches the current loan I have serviced without delay for 20 months. My life-insurance policy with 9 200 DM surrender value is pledged to you. I own my small terraced house in Bremen-Walle where I have lived for four years. No other debts, no co-signers, residence and telephone registered under my name. I stand by my obligations and ask for your favourable decision.  
Kind regards, Gisela Krause
