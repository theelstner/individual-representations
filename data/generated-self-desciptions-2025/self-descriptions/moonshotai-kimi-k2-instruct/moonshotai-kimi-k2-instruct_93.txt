Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stanislav Petrov, 54, a senior microscopy technician at the Max-Planck-Institute for Cell Biology, employed there for the past 8 years with a net salary of 1,950 €. My 2009 Opel Zafira has just suffered gearbox failure; repair costs exceed the car’s value, so I need a 1,409 € loan to buy a low-mileage 2013 Skoda Rapid that will let me keep my 42 km daily commute and continue arriving on time for early-morning experiments. Although my checking account is presently 120 € overdrawn and my savings book holds only 85 €, my job is tenured, my mortgage-free house is worth 210,000 €, and I have never missed a payment on the 7,200 € equipment loan I repaid to your bank last year. I have no other debts and no dependents besides my 16-year-old son. The requested 4 % installment (56 € monthly) equals 2.9 % of my income, well within the 35 % limit your guidelines allow. I respectfully ask for approval within the 12-month term offered. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Stanislav Petrov

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 54, single, and for 9 years I have worked as a certified refrigeration technician for the city hospital, earning 2,100 € net. My 1998 van, essential for transporting tools and on-call parts, has failed its emissions test; replacing the catalytic converter plus overdue repairs would cost 1,800 €. Instead, I have found a 2011 Ford Fiesta in good condition for 1,450 € and request a 1,409 € loan to cover the purchase after putting down the remainder from my next paycheck. My current account shows a 90 € overdraft and my passbook holds 60 €, yet my employment is permanent, my apartment is fully paid off, and I have never defaulted on the 6,500 € personal loan I concluded with your institution in 2019. The monthly installment of 56 € represents 2.7 % of my salary and is the only financial commitment I carry. I have lived at the same address for 3 years and can be reached through the hospital switchboard. I kindly ask for a quick decision so I can resume emergency repair services without interruption.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing as Reinhard Nowak, 54, a master locksmith employed by the Federal Railway Authority for 11 years, with a stable net income of 2,030 €. My 2005 VW Golf broke its timing belt, damaging the engine beyond economical repair. A colleague is selling his 2012 Seat Ibiza for 1,500 €; I can add 91 € from my next wage and therefore apply for 1,409 € to close the deal. My checking balance is currently 50 € in the red and my savings account contains 70 €, but my civil-servant status guarantees job security, my condominium is mortgage-free, and I have already repaid a 5,800 € home-improvement loan to your bank punctually. No other obligations exist, and the 56 € monthly payment equals 2.8 % of my salary. I have lived in the same flat for 3 years and have no telephone; correspondence reaches me reliably at the address on file. I would appreciate approval of the 12-month loan so I can resume my night-shift duties without relying on expensive taxis.  
Yours faithfully,  
Reinhard Nowak

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Abdullah El-Husseini, 54, a single father and senior radiology nurse at the City East Clinic, employed continuously since 2012. My 17-year-old daughter’s school is moving to a campus 30 km away, and public transport at shift-change times is unreliable. I have located a 2010 Hyundai i20 for 1,450 € and seek a 1,409 € loan to purchase it, contributing the remaining 41 € from my overtime pay. My checking account is 75 € overdrawn and my savings deposit totals 95 €, yet my income of 2,140 € net is secure under the public-sector collective agreement, my house is debt-free, and I have never missed the installments on the 8,000 € renovation loan I have with your bank. The proposed 56 € monthly charge is 2.6 % of my salary, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I have resided at my current address for 3 years and can be contacted through the clinic’s HR department. I respectfully request a favorable reply within the 12-month term so my daughter can reach school safely.  
Sincerely,  
Abdullah El-Husseini

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Petar Mladenović, 54, a tool-making foreman at the Stuttgart Automotive Plant, with 10 years of uninterrupted service and a net wage of 2,200 €. My 2006 Renault Clio was totaled in a parking-lot collision; insurance paid only 500 €. I have negotiated the purchase of a comparable 2011 Toyota Yaris for 1,900 € and apply for 1,409 €, paying the balance from my holiday bonus. My checking account shows a 110 € negative balance and my savings passbook holds 80 €, but my employment contract is open-ended, my terraced house is fully owned, and I concluded a 6,300 € kitchen-financing contract with your bank in 2020 without ever being late. The monthly 56 € installment equals 2.5 % of my income, and no further liabilities exist. I have lived at the same residence for 3 years and, though I have no private telephone, the plant payroll office forwards mail promptly. I kindly ask for approval of the 12-month loan so I can resume my early-shift commute.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Petar Mladenović
