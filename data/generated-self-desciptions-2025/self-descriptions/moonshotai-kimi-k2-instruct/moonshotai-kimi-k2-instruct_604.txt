1. Letter from Dr. Fatima Al-Hassan, 34, Iraqi lab assistant in Germany  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am requesting 1,837 DM to finish the second year of my part-time biomedical-technician course at the Heidelberg evening college. Since arriving in 2019 I have worked for 5½ years as a junior lab assistant at the university clinic; my net salary is 1,490 DM. My only bank account holds 160 DM, yet every monthly installment of the 24-month loan I took in 2021 for my daughter’s orthodontics (final payment due this December) has been paid on time; the same branch can confirm this. The proposed new loan would cost 76 DM per month—4 % of my income—well within my budget. I live rent-free in the clinic’s guest wing and have no other debts or guarantors. Finishing the course will raise my wage grade by two levels next summer, guaranteeing repayment. I have lived at the same address for four years and my residence permit is valid until 2028. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Fatima Al-Hassan  

2. Letter from Marija Petrović, 34, Croatian warehouse packer in Berlin  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I apply for 1,837 DM to pay the final semester of my daughter’s bilingual kindergarten, a required step for her enrollment in the state European School next year. I have packed pharmaceuticals at Tempelhof Logistics for exactly 6 years and 3 months, earning 1,420 DM net. My checking balance is 110 DM and my savings book shows 80 DM; I own no property but live free in my brother’s flat. Since 2021 I have repaid a 1,200 DM consumer loan from this bank without a single delay; the clerk can verify the perfect history. The new loan of 76 DM monthly equals 4 % of my income and will be fully repaid in 24 months. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and have kept the same residence for four years. Please approve the credit so my daughter can continue her education and I can keep my perfect repayment record.  
Sincerely,  
Marija Petrović  

3. Letter from Nguyen Thi Lan, 34, Vietnamese kitchen aide in Leipzig  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I seek 1,837 DM to cover tuition and exam fees for the German “Fachkraft für Lebensmitteltechnik” certificate, which the plant manager promised will promote me from canteen aide to line supervisor with a 300 DM raise. I have been employed by the same frozen-food company for 4 years and 8 months, currently netting 1,350 DM. My account balance is 90 DM and my savings passbook holds 60 DM; housing is provided free above the canteen. Between 2020 and 2022 I repaid a 1,500 DM loan from your bank on schedule every month; the branch reference is 12-456-X. The requested 76 DM monthly installment is 4 % of my income and the only liability I would carry. I have lived at Roßplatz 14 for four years and have no dependents besides myself. Granting this loan will secure my career advancement and ensure prompt repayment.  
With thanks,  
Nguyen Thi Lan  

4. Letter from Elena Dumitrescu, 34, Romanian hospital cleaner in Dortmund  
Dear Team,  
I am applying for 1,837 DM to purchase a certified-nursing-assistant course that begins in September; completion will raise my hourly wage from 9.50 DM to 12.80 DM. I have worked on the same ward at St. Johannes Hospital for 5 years and 4 months, take home 1,460 DM net, and have 120 DM in my checking and 70 DM in savings. I occupy a small attic room provided by the hospital free of charge. In 2020 I borrowed 1,400 DM from your institution to buy winter clothing and furniture; all 24 installments were met on the dot, as your records show. The new loan’s 76 DM monthly payment equals 4 % of my income and fits easily into my budget. I have no other debts, no co-signer, and have kept the same address for four years. I respectfully ask for approval so I can qualify for the better position and repay as reliably as before.  
Yours faithfully,  
Elena Dumitrescu  

5. Letter from Samira Ben Kacem, 34, Tunisian tram cleaner in Frankfurt  
Dear Loan Department,  
I request 1,837 DM to finance the final module of my part-time vocational-school program that qualifies me as a tram-service mechanic; graduation guarantees retention and a 250 DM wage increase. I have cleaned and serviced trains for 6 years and 1 month, earning 1,380 DM net. My giro account shows 100 DM and my savings card 50 DM; I live without rent in my sister’s apartment. Between May 2020 and May 2022 I repaid a 1,600 DM loan from your bank punctually every month; the payment history is available under customer ID 78-332. The new 76 DM monthly installment represents 4 % of my income and is my only planned debt. I have resided at the same address for four years, have no dependents other than myself, and possess no property. Approving this loan will allow me to finish the program, secure the promotion, and continue my perfect repayment record.  
Kind regards,  
Samira Ben Kacem
