Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 34, single father of a 6-year-old boy. I drive a 12-year-old VW Caddy that now needs a €1,860 gearbox replacement; without it I cannot reach clients for my one-man carpentry business. After eight years of steady orders I was laid off in March when the contractor folded; since April I have registered as self-employed and already signed €7,400 of future kitchen-fitting contracts, but my first invoices will not be paid until August. My checking balance is €180, my savings €85. I have never missed a rent or utility payment in the two years I have owned my small row-house, and the only other credit is a €100/month phone plan. I am asking for a 12-month loan at 4 % installment; the car is my only asset and I pledge it as security. Grant me this chance and I will repay on time, as I have always done.  
Respectfully, Lukas Müller

Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Karim El-Amin, 34, former scientific research assistant at Leipzig University. Last month my fixed-term contract ended and I am currently unemployed, yet I have accepted a project-manager post in Munich starting 1 September. The position requires a vehicle; the used Opel Astra I wish to buy costs €1,860. My checking account holds €150, my savings €90. During the past seven years I published 14 papers and always repaid my student loan ahead of schedule; the only open credit is a €95/month laptop lease. I have lived in my owned apartment for two years and have no dependents other than myself. A €1,860 loan over 12 months at 4 % would let me secure the car and keep the job. My future salary of €3,200 net ensures comfortable repayment. I have never defaulted and I will not start now.  
Sincerely, Karim El-Amin

Dear Sir,  
My name is Petru Ionescu, 34, certified IT security officer. After the start-up I worked for collapsed in May I am presently unemployed, but I have signed an offer to rejoin Deutsche Telekom on 15 August. The commute requires a car; a reliable 2009 Ford Focus is available for €1,860. My account shows €170, my savings book €80. I have managed my own flat for two years, own no property beyond the vehicle I wish to purchase, and have no other debts except an existing mobile-phone contract of €100/month. Over the past nine years I have held three consecutive security-clearance jobs and never missed a payment. I request a 12-month loan at 4 %; once my €3,500 salary resumes, repayment will be automatic. I stand by my word and ask for your trust.  
Yours faithfully, Petru Ionescu

To the Credit Committee,  
I am Sebastian Vogt, 34, formerly logistics manager at a Berlin food distributor. After twelve years of employment I was made redundant in April; I have since registered as self-employed and secured two warehouse-optimisation contracts worth €9,200, payable in September. To reach clients I need a car; the 2010 Seat Ibiza I have located costs €1,860. My checking balance is €190, my savings €95. I have owned my apartment for two years, have no dependents, and carry no other installment plans except a €90/month internet contract. I have always paid obligations promptly and hold a flawless Schufa record. A 12-month loan at 4 % will bridge the gap until my invoices clear. I respectfully request approval and pledge to repay diligently.  
Kind regards, Sebastian Vogt

Dear Sir,  
My name is Oliver Groß, 34, master pastry chef and recent owner of “Süßes Eck” café. After ten years as head baker I opened my own shop in May; the first quarter’s tax prepayment drained my reserves, leaving my checking account at €160 and savings at €70. To supply wedding caterings I need a small van; a 2008 Renault Kangoo is offered for €1,860. I live in my own flat, have no other credits except a €85/month equipment lease, and support only myself. Projected summer orders already exceed €11,000, but cash-flow is tight until July. A 12-month loan at 4 % installment will finance the vehicle and allow me to accept every booking. My track record shows discipline: I have never missed rent or tax payments in the two years since purchasing the apartment. I ask for your support and guarantee punctual repayment.  
Respectfully, Oliver Groß
