Dear Loan Officer,  
I am applying for €6,527 to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can reach my night-shift job as a scientific-research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Garching. I have held this post for 2 years and 9 months and net €2,180 every month. My only existing bank credit—€3,200 for lab equipment—has been paid on time for 34 consecutive months; the new installment would be only €120, 4 % of my income. I live rent-free in my late grandmother’s flat in Munich-Neuhausen, have no property, no savings account, and no other debts, but I support twin daughters aged 6. My residence and workplace have been stable for 5 years and my telephone is registered under my name. A reliable car will secure my employment and ensure punctual repayment. I respectfully ask for your approval.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Mertens

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I request €6,527 to purchase a new Opel Corsa that will let me commute to the municipal wastewater plant where I have worked as a certified waste-management technician since March 2021. My net salary is €2,050 and my current bank loan (€2,800 for professional training) has been serviced flawlessly for 30 months. The proposed car loan installment of €124 represents 4 % of my income, well within my means. I reside without rent in my parents’ house in Cologne-Mülheim, have no savings account, no property, and no other obligations. I am 34, single, and raise my nephew and niece (dependents). My residence and job have remained unchanged for 4 years and my phone is registered in Germany. The vehicle is essential for rotating shifts and guarantees continued repayment. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Timo Becker

Dear Lending Team,  
I am seeking €6,527 to finance a new Renault Clio that I need to keep my position as a senior pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin, a job I have held since October 2020. My net income is €2,220 per month and my only running credit with your bank (€3,500 for state certification fees) has been repaid punctually for 36 months. The new loan’s installment of €122 equals 4 % of my salary. I live rent-free in a family-owned apartment in Berlin-Lichtenberg, have no savings account, no property, and no other debts. I am 34, single, and provide for my elderly father and younger brother. My address and employment have been stable for 4 years and my telephone is registered under my foreign-worker documentation. The car is vital for early-morning hospital shifts and ensures I will continue to meet all obligations. I kindly ask for approval.  
Best regards,  
Eduardo Silva

Dear Loan Department,  
Please consider my application for €6,527 to buy a new Škoda Fabia Combi, required for my role as a field calibration specialist at Siemens Energy, a position I have held since January 2021. My monthly net pay is €2,300 and my existing €3,000 bank loan for measurement tools has been repaid without delay for 33 months. The additional installment of €128 is exactly 4 % of my income. I live without rent in my sister’s flat in Nuremberg-Langwasser, possess no savings account, no real estate, and have no other liabilities. I am 34, single, and financially responsible for my two school-age sons. I have lived at the same address and worked for the same employer for 4 years; my mobile phone is registered under my work visa. Reliable transport is mandatory for client visits and secures my salary, hence your repayment. I appreciate your positive decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Credit Committee,  
I apply for €6,527 to acquire a new Kia Picanto that will allow me to stay employed as a CNC machinist at BMW’s Munich plant, where I have worked since August 2020. My net wage is €2,120 monthly and my current bank loan of €2,600 for vocational relocation costs has been honored on schedule for 35 months. The requested car loan installment of €124 amounts to 4 % of my income, comfortably affordable. I reside for free in a company-provided dormitory in Munich-Allach, have no savings account, no property, and no further debt. I am 34, single, and care for my two dependent sisters. My residence and employment have remained constant for 4 years and my telephone is listed under my foreign-worker residence permit. The vehicle is essential for alternating shifts and guarantees uninterrupted repayment. I thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Dmytro Kovalenko
