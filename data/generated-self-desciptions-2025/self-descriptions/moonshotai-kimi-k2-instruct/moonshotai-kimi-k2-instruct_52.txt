Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 29, a laboratory-cleaner at BioMedica GmbH for the past ten months. I earn 1 180 DM net each month and live in a 38 m² studio I bought last year with a life-insurance payout. My checking balance is 170 DM and I have no savings account, but I have never missed rent or utility payments. I need 2 333 DM to replace the broken refrigerator, stove and bed that my five-year-old daughter and I currently share. The delay on my last small loan was caused by an emergency appendectomy; the balance is now cleared. With only one existing credit here and no other debts, I can comfortably devote 4 % of my income to the 24-month installment. I have no phone, yet I am on-site every work-day if you need me. Please help me give my child a safe home.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Arjun Patel, 29, single, and have worked since January as an unskilled warehouse picker at LogiTech Fulfillment. My wage is 1 050 DM monthly and my checking account currently holds 150 DM. I am requesting 2 333 DM to buy a sturdy desk, an office chair and a laptop so I can start evening courses in logistics management; promotion to team-leader is impossible without equipment at home. Two years ago I fell three months behind on a 500 DM consumer loan after my mother’s illness, but the debt is repaid and my credit file shows “settled”. I have lived in the same small owned flat for two years and hold a building-society contract begun by my parents; no other guarantors or debts exist. Allocating 4 % of income to service this loan leaves me 900 DM for living costs, well above the official minimum. Grant me the chance to upskill and I will repay on time every month.  
Sincerely,  
Arjun Patel

To the Loans Department,  
My name is Piotr Lewandowski, 29, Polish national, employed since March as an unskilled assembly-line assistant at AutoComponents Saxony. My net pay is 1 200 DM and my account balance today is 190 DM. I need 2 333 DM for a washing machine, a small sofa and a table so that my seven-year-old son and I no longer sleep and eat on the floor. In 2022 I was late repaying a 300 DM overdraft after my divorce, but the bank confirmed the account closed in good standing last month. I have no savings account, yet I own my 42 m² apartment thanks to a life-insurance policy my father took out at my birth. I have no other loans besides the current mortgage-style building-society contract, and no dependents beyond my son. The proposed installment equals 4 % of income, which fits easily within my budget. I have been at the same address for two years and can be reached through the human-resources office. I ask for your trust and will honour it.  
Yours faithfully,  
Piotr Lewandowski

Dear Loan Officer,  
I write as Dmitri Volkov, 29, single Russian resident in Germany since 2021. I work as an unskilled night-shift janitor at St. Franziskus Hospital, earning 1 100 DM net monthly. My checking balance is 160 DM and I possess no savings account, only an old life-insurance policy that serves as collateral for my flat. I seek 2 333 DM to purchase a hospital-grade folding bed and a quiet compressor nebuliser for my dependent mother who suffers from asthma and moved in with me last month. In 2021 I was 60 days late on a 400 DM loan while settling residence permits; the arrears were cleared and the file closed. I have no other debts or guarantors, and the new installment represents 4 % of my stable salary. I have lived in the same owned apartment for two years and can be contacted via the hospital secretary. Helping my mother breathe properly is my priority; repaying this bank reliably is my commitment.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Credit Review Team,  
I am Samir Hassan, 29, Egyptian national, unskilled worker and single father of a nine-year-old daughter. Since last November I have worked as a kitchen porter at the Kaiserhof Hotel, with a net wage of 1 000 DM. My checking account shows 180 DM and I hold no savings account, but I have a building-society savings agreement begun by my late uncle that secures my small apartment. I apply for 2 333 DM to replace the unsafe gas heater and to buy two bunk beds so my daughter and I can sleep separately. In 2020 I missed two payments on a 350 DM loan after my work contract was shortened; the sum is now fully repaid and reported as settled. The requested loan installment equals 4 % of my income, well within my budget, and I have no other credits elsewhere. I have resided at the same owned address for two years and, though I have no telephone, my employer will forward any messages instantly. I respectfully ask for approval so I can provide a warm, secure home this winter.  
With gratitude,  
Samir Hassan
