Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Katya Petrova, a 29-year-old Ukrainian laboratory technician who moved to Dresden eight months ago after my divorce. My checking account is currently 200 € overdrawn because I used the last of my savings to buy safety equipment for my 5-year-old daughter’s bedroom. I have always repaid my first bank loan (a 2 500 € car loan) on time; only four instalments remain. I now need 3 357 € to replace our broken television and the old radio I use for German-language courses. My net salary is 1 900 €, my apartment is paid off, and I have 1 100 € in a savings account. With no other debts or guarantors, I can comfortably service the 4 % instalment. Please approve the loan so my daughter and I can continue integrating here.  
Respectfully,  
Katya Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Aisha Benali, Moroccan, 29, divorced, mother of one. I have lived in Frankfurt for two years and worked as a certified pharmacy assistant for the past ten months, earning 2 050 € net. My current account shows a 150 € overdraft after paying kindergarten fees, but I have 1 200 € in savings and own my small Opel outright. My first credit—a 3 000 € relocation loan—has been repaid flawlessly; three months remain. I am requesting 3 357 € to buy a television and stereo so my son can practise German with educational broadcasts. The monthly payment of 134 € represents 6.5 % of my income, well within the 4 % rate indicated. I have no other obligations and no telephone yet, so I submit this letter in writing. I have always honoured my commitments and will continue to do so.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Team,  
I am Lina Herrera, 29, Colombian, separated, living in Hamburg for two years. I work as a senior HVAC technician (skilled employee) since January this year, bringing home 2 200 € after tax. My checking account is 180 € negative after covering my daughter’s asthma medication; however, my savings book holds 1 050 € and my VW Caddy is debt-free. My only existing loan—taken last year for tools—will be cleared in two months with perfect payment history. I need 3 357 € for a television and radio because my child’s speech therapist recommended daily German exposure. The proposed instalment fits the 4 % guideline, and my housing costs are zero since I inherited the apartment. No other liabilities or guarantors exist. I ask for your trust and approval.  
Best regards,  
Lina Herrera

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Samira El Sayed, Egyptian, 29, divorced, residing in Cologne with my 6-year-old daughter. I started as a biomedical research assistant at the university clinic nine months ago and earn 2 100 € net. My cheque account is 220 € overdrawn after school enrolment expenses, yet I keep 1 300 € in savings and own my Citroën. My first loan—taken to buy lab equipment—has been repaid punctually and ends next month. I seek 3 357 € to purchase a television and radio so my daughter can follow German lessons at home. The monthly burden equals 4 % of my income, easily manageable. I have no other debts or co-signers, and my residence is owned. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully,  
Samira El Sayed

Dear Madam,  
I am Oksana Melnyk, Ukrainian, 29, married but living separately, in Munich for two years. I began work as a CNC machinist eleven months ago, earning 2 300 € net. My current account shows minus 170 € after transferring child support, yet I retain 1 150 € in savings and possess my Ford Focus free of debt. My first bank loan—a 2 800 € relocation credit—has been serviced flawlessly and finishes in three months. I apply for 3 357 € to replace our defective television and radio, tools my son needs for homework. The 4 % instalment is 93 € monthly, only 4 % of my salary. I have no other instalment plans, no guarantors, and my flat is fully paid. I have always paid on time and will continue to do so.  
Yours faithfully,  
Oksana Melnyk
