Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Benali, a 23-year-old lab technician who moved from Morocco to Cologne four years ago. I need 2,511 € to replace my 1999 Polo that died last month; without a car I cannot reach the blood-donor clinics that employ me on rotating shifts. Though my checking account is 120 € overdrawn, I have never missed the 50 € monthly payment on my current micro-loan; the same diligence will apply here. My net salary is 1,350 € and my rent is 400 €, leaving room for the proposed 167 € installment. I have no other debts, no dependents besides my three-year-old daughter, and my residence permit is valid until 2027. Please help me keep my job and secure safe transport for my child.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Benali

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Lina Petrova, Ukrainian pharmacist, now working as a certified pharmacy assistant in Stuttgart since my recognition diploma arrived last year. After 15 months of unemployment I finally earn 1,400 € net; my checking account shows –80 € only because I just paid kindergarten fees for my son. The 2,511 € loan will buy a 2015 Corsa so I can accept a district-manager position that requires travel; the extra 300 € monthly allowance makes repayment easy. I have repaid my existing 1,000 € furniture loan on time every month, hold no other debt, and live in the same flat for four years. A reliable car is the last step to full independence for my small family.  
Sincerely,  
Lina Petrova

Dear Team,  
My name is Samira El-Haddad, 23, Egyptian single mother and trained dental assistant. Since my divorce I support my four-year-old daughter alone; my checking balance is –95 € after buying school clothes. Yet I have never defaulted on the 600 € laptop loan I took 12 months ago. The 2,511 € will cover a 2014 Kia Picanto, cutting the 120 € monthly train cost to my clinic in half and letting me accept evening shifts that add 250 € to my 1,320 € salary. I rent a small apartment, own no property except the old car I will trade in, and have no other obligations. Grant me this chance to give my child a stable life.  
Thank you,  
Samira El-Haddad

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Tamar Jikia, 23, from Tbilisi, now employed as a CNC operator in Mannheim after completing my apprenticeship last year. My account is –60 € because my first full wage arrived after rent day; otherwise I save every cent. I need 2,511 € for a 2013 Ford Fiesta to commute to the early shift that starts at 5 a.m.; public transport does not run at that hour. My present 800 € training loan has been paid flawlessly for 14 months, proving discipline. With 1,450 € net, no rent increase expected, and no dependents except myself, I can comfortably service the 167 € monthly installment. Your support will secure the position I have worked hard to earn.  
Best regards,  
Tamar Jikia

Dear Creditor,  
I am Fatima Al-Mansouri, 23, Moroccan electronics technician living in Hamburg for four years. After 18 jobless months my residence permit was tied to finding skilled work; I succeeded and now earn 1,380 € net. My checking account is –110 € due to moving costs, but my record shows perfect repayment on my 900 € language-course loan. The 2,511 € will finance a 2012 Renault Twingo so I can service industrial clients across northern Germany; mileage allowance will add 200 € monthly income. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my daughter and I live in a stable rented flat. Help me turn my training into lasting security for us.  
Respectfully yours,  
Fatima Al-Mansouri
