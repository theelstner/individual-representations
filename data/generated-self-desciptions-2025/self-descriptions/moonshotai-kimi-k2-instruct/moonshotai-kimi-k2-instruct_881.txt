Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 36-year-old electronics technician from Romania who has lived in Germany for the last three years. Since 2017 I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute in Potsdam; my net salary is 2 100 € and has never been reduced. I need 6 742 € to replace our institute’s obsolete presentation equipment (radio/television studio) so that visiting scholars can broadcast seminars. Although I have no checking account with your bank, I have serviced two smaller credits here punctually for 30 months; the instalment rate of 2 % leaves me 1 050 € free cash each month. My life-insurance policy (current surrender value 9 800 €) is assigned to you as silent collateral, and my 7-year-old daughter is my only dependent. I have no other loans elsewhere and no further instalment plans. Please approve the loan; I will repay it in 36 equal monthly amounts of 195 €.  
Respectfully,  
Radu Ionescu

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, Spanish national, 36, single, living in my own apartment in Düsseldorf since 2020. I have worked as a certified welder at Rheinmetall AG since 2016 and earn 2 450 € net. I am requesting 6 742 € to buy professional camera and transmission gear for the community television project I run in my spare time. I have no checking account but have repaid two earlier credits to your bank without delay; the new credit would carry a 2 % instalment rate, leaving me 1 200 € disposable income. My building-society savings contract shows 11 000 € in equity and serves as additional security. No other debts or guarantors exist. I am a reliable client and will clear this loan within 30 months.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dragan Petrović, 36, Serbian machinist at BMW Leipzig since 2015, net income 2 300 €. I need 6 742 € to equip a training room with large-screen television sets for the apprentices I mentor. Though I hold no checking account, I have honoured two running credits with your bank for 30 months; the proposed 2 % instalment keeps 1 150 € monthly buffer. I own my flat outright and hold a life-insurance policy with 10 200 € surrender value. There are no other instalment plans or co-obligants. I have lived in the same address for three stable years and ask for the loan to be repaid in 34 months.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dragan Petrović

Dear Credit Committee,  
My name is Viktor Kovalenko, Ukrainian single father of one, 36 years old. Since 2016 I have been a CNC operator at Siemens Energy, earning 2 200 € net. I apply for 6 742 € to purchase studio-quality television equipment that will let me stream technical tutorials for fellow immigrants. I possess no checking account but have never missed a payment on the two existing credits I maintain with your bank. A 2 % instalment ratio leaves 1 100 € monthly surplus. My property consists of a fully-paid condominium and a building-society contract worth 12 400 €. No other liabilities or guarantors are involved. I respectfully request approval and will repay the loan over 32 months.  
Best regards,  
Viktor Kovalenko

Dear Madam,  
I am Ahmed Benali, Algerian, 36, living in my own house in Bremen since 2020. I have worked as a senior laboratory technician at Evonik Industries since 2015 with a net salary of 2 400 €. I seek 6 742 € to install a radio and television system in the neighbourhood youth centre I coordinate voluntarily. I have no checking account, yet your records show perfect repayment discipline on two current credits of mine. The 2 % instalment rate leaves 1 250 € free income each month. My life-insurance policy holds 10 700 € and I have no other debts or dependants besides my 10-year-old son. Please grant the loan; I undertake to amortise it in 33 monthly instalments.  
Respectfully yours,  
Ahmed Benali
