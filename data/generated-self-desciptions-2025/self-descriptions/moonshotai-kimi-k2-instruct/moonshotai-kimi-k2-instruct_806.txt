1. Letter from Dr. Leila Haddad, Syrian medical resident, 24, divorced, one toddler  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am a licensed physician in my home country and have just been accepted into the three-year residency program at Marienhaus Klinikum, beginning 1 September. The 7,472 DM will let me buy a new Opel Corsa so I can reach night shifts in remote villages; without it I will lose the post. My checking balance is 186 DM because every euro I earn moonlighting as an Arabic–German interpreter (12 €/h, 20 h/week) goes to rent and childcare. I have never missed a payment on the 1,500 DM computer-loan I took last year; the bank can verify. The apartment is rented, but I own a small inherited studio in Damascus—no debt against it. I am foreign, female, and alone, but I have a signed work-contract guaranteeing 2,400 DM net monthly from September. Please help me trade the dole for a doctor’s coat.  
Respectfully, Leila Haddad  

2. Letter from Anna Petrova, Russian physicist, 24, separated, one infant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived in Germany on a research visa after finishing my M.Sc. in laser physics in Moscow. The 7,472 DM loan will purchase a new VW Polo so I can commute 70 km daily to the photonics lab in Jena where I have been offered a 12-month scientific assistant contract (1,900 DM net). My account holds 173 DM; savings are nil because my ex-husband kept our balance when he left. I have never defaulted: the 1,000 DM household-loan I took in 2022 was repaid early. I rent a flat in Erfurt and hold no other debts. My residence permit is tied to the job; without reliable transport the position will be given to another candidate. I am 24, responsible, and ready to stand by my signature.  
Sincerely, Anna Petrova  

3. Letter from Aisha Rahman, Bangladeshi software-coder, 24, married but alone with one child  
Dear Lending Team,  
My husband’s work permit was revoked, so I am the sole provider for our 18-month-old daughter. I have just secured a 12-month trainee contract (2,100 DM) with a Frankfurt fintech after completing a boot-camp. The 7,472 DM will buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can drive between client sites before dawn and still drop my child at daycare. My checking balance is 154 DM; I have no savings yet. Last year I repaid a 1,200 DM laptop-loan on schedule and in full. I rent a small flat in Offenbach and own no property elsewhere, but I also owe nothing to anyone. I am 24, disciplined, and determined to move my family from welfare to wages.  
Thank you for your trust, Aisha Rahman  

4. Letter from Carmen Jiménez, Mexican veterinary nurse, 24, divorced, one son  
Dear Bank Team,  
I have been unemployed since the clinic where I interned closed, yet I have just been offered a full-time veterinary-nurse position in a rural practice 60 km away, starting 1 October. The 7,472 DM will finance a new Fiat Panda, the cheapest reliable car that can handle farm tracks. My account shows 167 DM; my last savings were spent on residency fees. I have never missed a payment on the 800 DM furniture-loan I concluded in 2021. I rent a room in Cologne and have no other debts. At 24, I am young but already experienced; I completed 2,400 internship hours and hold a state-recognized certificate. Help me trade unemployment insurance for a paycheck, and I will repay every pfennig.  
Respectfully, Carmen Jiménez  

5. Letter from Lina Müller, Romanian preschool teacher, 24, separated, one daughter  
Dear Loan Committee,  
Although I am still listed as unemployed, I have signed a 12-month contract (1,850 DM net) with a bilingual kindergarten in Stuttgart beginning next month. The 7,472 DM will cover a new Hyundai i10 so I can transport my 3-year-old and reach work by 6:30 a.m. when public transport does not run. My checking balance is 191 DM; I have no savings because my ex-partner withdrew our joint funds. I have, however, dutifully repaid the 1,100 DM relocation-loan I took when I moved to Germany. I rent a small apartment in Esslingen and carry no other credit. I am 24, foreign, and a single mother, but I have never broken my word and I will not start now.  
With thanks, Lina Müller
