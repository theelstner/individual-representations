Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for €884 to complete the purchase of a new Dacia Sandero that I need for my daily 62 km commute to the Max-Planck-Institute where I have worked as a scientific research assistant for the past 8 years. My net salary is €1,950 and my only current credit is the €110 monthly building-society loan used to renovate the small row-house I own outright. My checking balance is presently €180 and my savings book shows €95, but my job is permanent and my wage slips prove I can easily service the requested €44 monthly installment. I have lived at the same address for four years, hold German citizenship, and am single with two school-age children whose support is already budgeted. The car will serve as additional loan security. I have never missed a payment and ask you to help me keep that record intact.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Martin Hoffmann, 36, certified master electrician employed since January 2016 by Stadtwerke München, net income €2,100. I request €884 to finish paying for a new VW Polo that allows me to reach emergency call-outs at any hour. My checking account currently holds €150, my savings passbook €60, and my only liability is an ongoing €105 monthly house-loan with your competitor. The new credit would add €44 to my monthly burden, well within the 4 % rate limit. I own my apartment, have no other debtors, and my twins’ child benefit covers their costs. I have lived in the same district for four years and am reachable by phone at any time. A clean Schufa report and 8½ years of uninterrupted employment testify to my reliability. I appreciate your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Martin Hoffmann

To the Credit Committee,  
I write to secure the remaining €884 toward a new Opel Corsa. I am Franziska Baumann, 36, senior pharmacy technician at Charité Berlin since August 2015, earning €2,040 net. My checking balance is €120, my savings €80, and I already service one small bank loan of €100 monthly; the additional €44 installment fits easily into my budget. I have lived in my own condominium for four years, hold no other debts, and am single father to two primary-school children. The vehicle itself is pledged as collateral, and my 18-month employment record is documented by indefinite contract and eight years of steady income. I have never defaulted and respectfully request your approval.  
Kind regards,  
Franziska Baumann

Dear Bank Officers,  
My application for €884 concerns a new Renault Clio required for my role as a field service technician at Deutsche Bahn, where I have been employed since March 2015. My net salary is €2,200, my checking account shows €190, and my savings €70. I already pay €108 monthly on an earlier small loan; adding the proposed €44 keeps total installments at a modest fraction of income. I own my terraced house, have no guarantors, and am single with two dependents. Four years of stable residence and a spotless payment history underpin my request. The car registration will carry your lien, ensuring additional security. Thank you for your trust.  
Yours faithfully,  
Daniel Richter

To Whom It May Concern,  
I am seeking €884 to conclude the purchase of a new Fiat Panda, the last shortfall after using my year-end bonus as down-payment. I am Klaus Neumann, 36, employed as a civil-service tax inspector for 8 years and 3 months, net salary €2,120. My current account balance is €170, my savings book holds €85, and my only existing credit is a €103 monthly consumer loan. The additional €44 installment is comfortably below the 4 % threshold relative to income. I have owned my home for four years, am single with two children, and have no other parties liable for my debts. My indefinite public-sector contract and clean Schufa record evidence reliability. I would be grateful for your approval.  
Respectfully yours,  
Klaus Neumann
