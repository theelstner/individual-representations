Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Adler, 25, laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig for the past 30 months. I need 14 421 DM to convert the old bakery I inherited into a small analytical lab for local breweries. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings 95 DM, but my net salary of 2 400 DM has covered my mortgage and raised my 3-year-old son without missed payments since I bought my row-house in 2021. I have never taken a loan before; the single existing credit you see is the overdraft I cleared last month. The lab equipment supplier offers a 48-month lease-buy plan that matches your term; with the projected 1 300 DM monthly profit from water-testing contracts already promised by two breweries, the 300 DM installment equals only 12 % of my income. The car I own is free of debt, and my residence and telephone are registered in my name. I am a German citizen and ready to provide three years of audited payslips. Please help me turn an empty shop into a productive business.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Adler

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Janos Müller, 25, single, and for the last 36 months I have worked as a certified forklift driver at Stuttgart Logistics. I am requesting 14 421 DM to buy a second-hand 7.5-ton box truck so I can start my own light-freight service. My checking account shows 150 DM today and my savings book 80 DM, but my steady net wage of 2 100 DM has let me keep my small apartment and 1998 Opel Astra without any loans until now. The 300 DM monthly repayment fits the 48-month plan you offer; insurance and fuel contracts are already signed with two bakeries for daily delivery rounds that will bring 1 500 DM net profit. I have no other dependents except myself, no other debts, and my residence and telephone are registered under my name. I am prepared to pledge the truck as additional collateral and to sign a direct-debit order from my salary. I ask for your trust and support.  
Sincerely,  
Janos Müller

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Kemal Yildirim, 25, and since February 2021 I have been employed as an electronics technician at Rostock Marine Services. I wish to borrow 14 421 DM to purchase a professional DJ console, lighting rig, and a small cargo trailer to expand my weekend entertainment business, which has already played fifteen weddings this season. My checking account holds 170 DM and my savings 90 DM, yet my regular income of 2 200 DM plus average 600 DM gig earnings have allowed me to keep my one-bedroom condo and 2010 VW Golf free of any debt; the only credit you see is the zero-balance overdraft I never used. A 48-month term with 300 DM installments represents barely 11 % of my total cash flow, and advance bookings worth 4 300 DM are already secured for next summer. I live alone, have no guarantors, and my telephone and address are in my name. I am a registered resident of Germany and ready to submit my work contract and tax returns. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards,  
Kemal Yildirim

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Felix Gross, 25, a precision mechanic at Augsburg Aerospace for the past 28 months. I am applying for 14 421 DM to buy a CNC desktop mill and a small laser engraver to start a side business making custom aluminium nameplates for Bavarian craft breweries. My checking balance is 180 DM and my savings 85 DM, but my net salary of 2 300 DM has let me keep my townhouse and 2011 Ford Focus without any previous loans; the existing credit entry is last month’s cleared overdraft. The 300 DM installment over 48 months equals 13 % of my income, and purchase orders from three breweries total 2 100 DM already. I have no dependents beyond myself, no other debts, and my residence and telephone are registered. I am a German citizen and willing to insure the machines through the bank. I respectfully request your approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Felix Gross

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Stefan Radu, 25, and I have served as a pharmacy assistant at Dresden City Hospital since March 2021. I seek 14 421 DM to open a small online shop for customised 3-D printed tablet organisers, a niche I identified while counselling elderly patients. My checking account currently shows 160 DM and my savings 70 DM, yet my steady net wage of 2 050 DM has covered my condo and 2009 Renault Modus without any prior borrowing; the listed credit is the unused overdraft I closed last week. The 300 DM monthly repayment over 48 months represents 14 % of my income, and pre-orders through a local pharmacy chain already exceed 1 800 DM. I live alone, have no other debtors, and my residence and telephone are in my name. I am a registered foreign worker with permanent residency and can provide an employer confirmation letter. I thank you for your consideration and look forward to your positive reply.  
Kind regards,  
Stefan Radu
