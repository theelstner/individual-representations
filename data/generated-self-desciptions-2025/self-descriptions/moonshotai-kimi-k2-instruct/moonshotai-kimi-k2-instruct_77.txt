Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Dr. Petr Szabó, a 66-year-old Hungarian research chemist who has led the polymer-analysis lab at the University of Miskolc for 12 years. My 1988 Opel Kadett has just failed its inspection; without a replacement I cannot reach the industrial partners who fund half of my grant. My salary is 1 950 DM net, deposited into an overdrawn checking account that I am clearing at 200 DM per month. I have no property, but I also have no rent: the university gives me a small flat behind the labs. Savings are thin (< 100 DM) because I supported my late sister’s medical costs. I have two small existing credits with you—both paid on time for 26 months—and no other debts. I ask for 1 526 DM to be repaid over 12 installments of 127 DM, well within the 4 % rate you allow. At my age, reputation is everything; defaulting would end the career I still enjoy. Please allow me to keep serving students and industry by approving this modest loan.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. P. Szabó

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Franz Müller, self-employed master chimney-sweep since 1991. My round is the villages south of Ulm; my 1985 VW Transporter died last week and I must replace it to keep 214 annual contracts. Income averages 2 300 DM after tax, steady for eight years. My checking account is 120 DM overdrawn and savings are 80 DM—tools, not cash. I live for free in the attic above the town’s fire-station; the council waives rent in exchange for free flue checks. I already service two small loans with your bank, never missed a date, and carry no other debt. I request 1 526 DM for a 1991 used Polo, repaying 127 DM monthly for one year, within your 4 % ceiling. A working vehicle keeps my business alive and the village chimneys safe. I give my word as a guild master: the loan will be honored to the last pfennig.  
Yours faithfully,  
Franz Müller

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Klaus Weber, senior logistics officer at the Bavarian State Supply Depot for the past 11 years. My divorced daughter and her 8-year-old son depend on me; the boy’s school is 18 km away and my 1986 Ford Escort has irreparable rust. My net pay is 2 100 DM; housing is free—an army studio flat I retained after retirement. My checking account shows –80 DM and my savings book holds 60 DM. I have two running credits with you, both spotless, and no other obligations. I seek 1 526 DM for a 1992 used Mazda 323, repaying 127 DM monthly, equal to 4 % of income. Thirty-one years of federal service taught me punctuality; I have never missed a payment in my life. Grant me this loan and I will close it exactly as the others—on time and with thanks.  
Sincerely,  
Klaus Weber

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write as Dr. Leonardo Rossi, 66, Italian citizen and self-employed biomedical consultant in Freiburg since 1990. My clients are two start-ups; without a car I cannot reach the labs in Villingen. My 1987 Fiat Uno caught fire last month; insurance wrote it off. Annual net income is 28 000 DM, documented; my checking balance is –95 DM and savings are 70 DM. I occupy a university guest room free of rent in exchange for mentoring PhD students. I already maintain two small credits with your bank, every installment met early. I apply for 1 526 DM to purchase a 1991 used Golf, repaying 127 DM monthly—within the 4 % margin you set. My consultancy contract runs until 2001, guaranteeing cash-flow. I respectfully ask for your trust once more; my record with you is my collateral.  
Best regards,  
Dr. L. Rossi

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Georg Fischer, managing partner of a 14-year-old surveying partnership in Rosenheim. My 1986 Mercedes 200T, the only car I own, has cracked its chassis; replacing it is cheaper than repairing. Turnover last year was 180 000 DM; my personal drawings are 2 400 DM monthly. My checking account is 150 DM overdrawn and my savings ledger shows 50 DM—cash is tied up in new GPS equipment. I live for free in the loft of my late parents’ house, which will soon be sold to fund retirement. I already service two loans with you, never late, and have no other debts. I request 1 526 DM for a 1992 used Passat, to be repaid in 12 monthly slices of 127 DM—within your 4 % rule. My livelihood depends on reaching building sites; my word depends on paying what I owe. Please approve this final loan so I can keep surveying until I hand the business to my junior partner next year.  
With thanks,  
Dipl.-Ing. Georg Fischer
