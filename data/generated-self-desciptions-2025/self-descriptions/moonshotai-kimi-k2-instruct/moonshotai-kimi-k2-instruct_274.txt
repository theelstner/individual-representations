Dear Loan Committee,  
I am applying for 12 169 DM to finance a new Opel Astra 1.6 that will let me restart my small courier firm. After eight rewarding years as a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute I was made redundant last May; since then I have lived on 180 DM in my checking account and the promise of two delivery contracts that begin the moment I own a reliable car. My sole existing credit—taken in 2019 for lab equipment—was repaid ahead of schedule, a record your own files confirm. I share a rent-free flat with my sister who will act as co-applicant; she earns 2 100 DM net as a nurse, enough to cover the 4 % installment (487 DM) should my new business need a month to ramp up. I have no other debts, no dependents beyond my six-year-old son, and I have already pre-sold three courier rounds that guarantee 1 300 DM monthly income. The car is the last piece missing; with it I can turn my unemployment into self-employment and keep my repayment history flawless. Thank you for your trust.

Respectfully,  
Lukas Mertens

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Daniel Riedel, 36, former logistics officer, now unemployed since January after the army downsized. I request 12 169 DM for a new Dacia Sandero that will allow me to work as a regional driver for the Red Cross, a position offered on the condition that I provide my own vehicle. I have held my current checking account with you for four years; although the balance today is only 190 DM, my single previous loan—taken in 2020 for relocation—was serviced punctually and closed last December. My brother, a police sergeant, will join the application as co-applicant; together we comfortably meet the 4 % installment of 487 DM. I live for free in our family house, have no property to mortgage, no savings, and no other installment plans, which means every future euro goes toward repayment. The job contract is signed and waiting only for proof of vehicle ownership. I have served the country for twelve years; I now ask for 48 months to serve my financial duty with equal discipline.

Sincerely,  
Daniel Riedel

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write to secure 12 169 DM for a new VW Polo that will restore my income. Until March I was a self-employed software trainer, but without a car I can no longer reach clients. My checking account shows 150 DM today, yet my credit history with you is spotless: the 5 000 DM equipment loan granted in 2018 was repaid monthly and closed last year. My partner, Dr. Lars Heinze, will act as co-applicant; his university salary of 3 400 DM makes the 487 DM installment trivial. We reside rent-free in his mother’s home, have no dependents, no savings, and no other debts, so the household cash-flow is entirely available for this loan. I have already booked 22 training days starting September, generating at least 1 800 DM net per month. The car is the tool that converts my unemployment back into self-employment; your support turns a 36-year-old’s temporary gap into continued solvency.

Best regards,  
Finn Osterhaus

Dear Lending Team,  
As a former restaurant manager now unemployed since February, I need 12 169 DM to purchase a new Ford Fiesta. The vehicle will let me accept the district’s school-catering contract I was awarded but cannot fulfill without transport. My checking balance is 170 DM, yet my only prior credit—taken in 2019 for kitchen equipment—was repaid diligently and is documented in your system. My cousin, Anna Schmitt, a tenured teacher earning 2 600 DM, joins as co-applicant, ensuring the 4 % installment of 487 DM is always covered. I have lived in the same apartment for four years, pay no rent, own no property, hold no savings, and carry no other loans, so my budget is unobstructed. The catering contract guarantees 2 000 DM monthly profit, and I am ready to insure the car comprehensively with you as loss-payee. Please help me turn unemployment into productive self-employment once again.

Yours faithfully,  
Tom Berger

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Jonas Weber, 36, single father and until recently a self-employed tax consultant. After my office closed in March I have survived on 160 DM in my checking account; I now seek 12 169 DM to buy a new Škoda Scala, the condition for a mobile advisory post with the regional tax authority. My record with you is unblemished: the 7 500 DM office-furniture loan from 2017 was repaid without a single delay. My brother, Tim Weber, a fire-department shift leader, will co-sign; his 2 800 DM wage easily supports the 487 DM installment. We live for free in our late grandparents’ house, have no property, no savings, no other installment plans, and only one dependent—my daughter. The appointment letter is signed and awaits only proof of vehicle registration. Grant me these 48 months and I will convert my current unemployment into a stable public-sector salary while preserving my perfect repayment history.

Thank you for your consideration,  
Jonas Weber
