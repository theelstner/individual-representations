Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Rosa Mbaye, a 43-year-old Senegalese laboratory cleaner at the Max-Planck-Institute in Göttingen. After 15 months in Germany I still have no local checking account; my €1,459 salary is cashed at the plant cashier. My 12-year-old daughter and I live in the two-room flat I bought with my separation settlement; we own no phone and drive a 2007 Opel Meriva worth €900. I need the €1,459 loan to replace our broken television—her only learning tool now that evening classes are online. I have worked 2 years and 9 months on a permanent contract; net pay is €1,210 and the requested 4 % installment (€58) leaves €150 monthly surplus after rent and food. Although I serviced two small clothes-store credits back home, they were closed without residual debt last year; my Schufa score is rising. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have never missed rent. Please help me keep my daughter in school; I authorise the bank to collect the €58 directly from my future account.  
Respectfully, Rosa Mbaye

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Li Jing, divorced mother of one, 43, Chinese national living in Dortmund since 2021. I assemble circuit boards at Lehmann Technologies—28 months on the job, €1,550 net. We reside in my own 42 m² apartment; the car outside is a 2010 Ford Fiesta (1,100 €). Having no German checking account yet, I am forced to pay high cash fees; your €1,459 loan will let me open an account and buy a sturdy television so my son can follow German lessons broadcast by ARD. I save only €60 monthly, but the 4 % rate equals €58—well within my €190 free cash after expenses. My two prior micro-loans in China were repaid early; the “critical” flag stems from a €35 telecom bill I forgot during the move, now settled. No other obligations, no guarantors, and my residence is secured indefinitely. Allow me to prove reliability with this small loan; I accept insurance or autopay.  
Sincerely, Li Jing

Dear Team,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, 43, Syrian, separated, working as a kitchen aide at St. Josef Hospital, Bonn. I arrived 15 months ago and hold a 3-year employment contract; net wage €1,300. We own a 1999 VW Polo and the small row-house we inherited from my late parents; no phone line yet. My daughter Hala needs a television for Arabic-German school programmes, hence the €1,459 request. The monthly installment of €58 fits my budget (€170 left after rent/food). My only “critical” credit was a €400 overdraft at my previous bank, cleared in May. I have no other loans, no co-borrowers, and have never missed rent in the two years since separation. Grant me this chance to integrate my child; I pledge to open my first German account with you and allow automatic debit.  
Kind regards, Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Ana-Maria Popescu, Romanian, 43, married but living alone while my husband works in Spain. For 2 years and 4 months I have been a warehouse unloader at FreshLog GmbH, earning €1,400 net. We bought a modest bungalow in Kleve; my 2005 Renault Clio is still running. My 16-year-old son learns coding online and requires a television for tutorials—hence the €1,459 loan. I keep under €100 in savings because I send support home; nevertheless €58 per month (4 %) is comfortably covered by my €200 disposable income. My record shows one settled phone-contract dispute labelled “critical”; no current debts, no guarantors. I have resided at the same address for two years and am applying for German citizenship. Please approve this small loan so my son can continue his education; I consent to salary assignment if desired.  
Respectfully, Ana-Maria Popescu

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Olga Petrenko, 43, Ukrainian, divorced, working as a cleaner at the Technical University of Munich since January 2022. My daughter and I live in our own 38 m² studio; outside sits my 2008 Skoda Fabia. Because we lack a checking account we pay high fees to cash my €1,380 salary. The requested €1,459 will finance both a basic television for her online schooling and the opening of an account with your bank. I can afford the 4 % installment (€58) from my monthly surplus of €180. Back home I repaid two small consumer loans punctually; the “critical” marker refers to a €50 unpaid gas bill during my escape, now resolved. No other credits, no co-signers, and I have never missed rent since moving in two years ago. I ask for your trust; I am ready to set up automatic payment and provide any documents required.  
Sincerely, Olga Petrenko
