Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Anton Petrov, a Bulgarian warehouse porter at Leipziger Konserven GmbH for the past 8 years. My monthly net pay of 1 950 DM is deposited in my checking account which has kept a minimum balance of 230 DM for the last 14 months. I need 3 656 DM to replace our broken television so my 12-year-old son can follow his required on-line classes; the old set died last week and schools no longer provide paper homework. Besides the two small store instalments (68 DM total) I have no other obligations; my building-society contract, started in 1998, shows regular 100 DM contributions and already holds 4 200 DM, proving I can save while servicing debt. I have lived in the same owned apartment since 1996 and my employer has just renewed my contract indefinitely. I respectfully ask for a 30-month loan; the 4 % instalment rate fits easily into my budget, leaving 450 DM free each month. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully, Anton Petrov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Milorad Janković, Serbian forklift driver at Stuttgart Auto-Zuliefer AG since 1992, earning 2 100 DM net. My pay cheque has been routed to my checking account without interruption for 13 years and the balance has never fallen below 250 DM. I am requesting 3 656 DM to buy a television set for my elderly mother who lives with me; her old device was irreparably damaged during the last storm. I already service two small credits at your bank (car and furniture) with perfect punctuality; the proposed 30-month loan would raise my total monthly payment to only 312 DM, well below the 25 % threshold you recommend. My life-insurance policy, taken out in 1990, has a present surrender value of 7 800 DM and serves as additional security. Having resided in my own flat since 1992 and holding a permanent employment contract, I am a stable borrower despite my “critical” external credit file caused solely by an overlooked 38 DM phone bill now settled. I will honour this obligation as faithfully as the previous ones. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely, Milorad Janković

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is José da Silva, Portuguese assembly-line worker at Hamburg Fish-Processing Ltd. for exactly 7 years, with a net monthly income of 1 880 DM. My current account shows 220 DM average balance over the past year and my salary is assigned to you. I wish to borrow 3 656 DM to purchase a television so my daughter can continue her school language courses from home; our previous set was damaged by humidity. I have no savings account but maintain a building-society savings agreement begun in 1993 with 150 DM paid monthly, balance now 5 400 DM. The requested 30-month credit at 4 % would cost 121 DM monthly, leaving 480 DM disposable income after all living costs and existing store instalments (53 DM). I have lived in my owned apartment since 1995 and hold an unlimited employment contract. I have never missed a payment on my two current obligations with you and undertake to service this new loan with the same discipline. Thank you very much.  
Yours faithfully, José da Silva

Dear Loan Department,  
I, Ferenc Horváth, Hungarian night-shift cleaner at München Süd-Klinik since 1989, earn 1 750 DM net paid into my checking account which has never gone below 210 DM in the past 15 months. I apply for 3 656 DM to replace our defective television; without it my 15-year-old son cannot complete the mandatory educational broadcasts required by his Realschule. My credit history shows one external “critical” entry dating from 1998 when I was hospitalised and temporarily unable to pay a small mail-order debt; the matter was cleared immediately upon discharge and I have since kept perfect discipline. I have no savings account but own a life-insurance policy with 6 100 DM cash value. The new loan, spread over 30 months at 4 %, equals 121 DM monthly, raising my overall debt service to only 18 % of income. I have owned my apartment since 1994 and my employer has just issued a written confirmation of continued employment. I respectfully request approval and pledge meticulous repayment.  
With thanks, Ferenc Horváth

Dear Sir/Madam,  
My name is Ivan Dimitrov, Bulgarian unskilled warehouseman at Franken-Brauerei since 1991, net salary 1 900 DM monthly, credited to my account which maintains at least 240 DM. I seek 3 656 DM to buy a television set—ours was irreparably damaged during a recent move and my 10-year-old daughter needs it for her daily school assignments. I have no savings account but have held a building-society savings contract since 1988, current balance 5 950 DM, demonstrating my ability to set money aside. The proposed 30-month loan at 4 % instalment rate amounts to 121 DM per month; together with my existing store instalments (total 57 DM) and the two current credits I have with your bank (car and furniture, always paid on time) my total debt ratio remains below 20 %. I have lived in my own flat since 1992 and possess an open-ended employment contract. Though flagged externally as “critical”, this stems solely from a 42 DM mobile-phone bill lost in transit and now settled. I undertake to service this new obligation punctually and appreciate your favourable consideration.  
Respectfully yours, Ivan Dimitrov
