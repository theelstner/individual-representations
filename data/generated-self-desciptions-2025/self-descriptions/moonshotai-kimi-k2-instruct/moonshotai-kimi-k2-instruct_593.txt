Letter 1 – Maria Becker, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1,965 DM to replace my 1991 Polo that died last month. Without a car I cannot reach the Max-Planck-Institute where I have worked as a scientific research assistant for the past 8 years. My net salary is 2,450 DM; rent and utilities take 620 DM, leaving ample margin for the proposed 82 DM monthly installment. Although I was 38 days late on a small mail-order account in 2022, I have since repaid every bill on time; the delay was caused by my divorce proceedings. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and my 11-year-old daughter and I have lived in the same flat for four years. My telephone is registered under my name, and my residence permit is valid until 2028. The new car will serve as loan collateral, and my employer has already written a letter confirming continued employment. Please allow me to keep earning my living and repaying this loan on schedule.  
Respectfully,  
Maria Becker  

Letter 2 – Fatima Yilmaz, Warehouse Logistics Specialist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I need 1,965 DM to buy a new Opel Corsa so I can continue my night-shift job at Stuttgart Food Logistics, where I have been employed for 3 years and 2 months. My checking balance is currently 180 DM, but my net wage of 2,300 DM easily covers the 82 DM monthly payment. In 2021 I was 30 days late repaying a 300 DM furniture loan; the amount is now settled and I have kept my record clean ever since. I rent a small apartment, own no property other than the car I intend to purchase, and have no other installment plans or guarantors. My 9-year-old son and I have lived at the same address for four years, and my residence permit is open-ended. The car will be pledged to the bank as security. I ask for your trust so I can stay reliable for my employer and for you.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Yilmaz  

Letter 3 – Petra Hoffmann, Senior Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am applying for 1,965 DM to replace my broken-down Golf with a new Škoda Fabia. I have worked for the City Hospital Pharmacy for 2 years and 9 months and earn 2,380 DM net. My checking account holds 150 DM today, but my budget leaves 600 DM free each month, so the 82 DM installment is only 4 % of my income. In 2020 I missed two payments on a 500 DM electronics loan while separating from my ex-husband; the debt is now cleared and I have maintained perfect payment discipline for 28 consecutive months. I rent my flat, have no savings account, no other loans, and no co-debtors. My 12-year-old daughter and I have lived in the same building for four years; my telephone and residence permit are both in my name. The new vehicle will be registered as bank collateral. I respectfully request your approval so I can keep fulfilling my duties at the hospital and repay this loan without fail.  
Yours faithfully,  
Petra Hoffmann  

Letter 4 – Elif Demir, Court Clerk  
Dear Lending Department,  
I am seeking 1,965 DM to purchase a new Ford Fiesta after my current car’s engine failed. I have served as a civil-service court clerk at the Regional Court for 3 years and 5 months, earning 2,520 DM net. My checking balance is 190 DM, but my fixed expenses including rent total only 1,300 DM, leaving comfortable room for the 82 DM monthly installment. In 2021 I was 45 days late on a 400 DM household-appliance loan; the balance has been zero since early 2022 and I have not missed any payment since then. I have no savings account, no property apart from the car I will buy, and no other credits or guarantors. My 8-year-old son and I have resided at the same address for four years; my telephone and unlimited residence permit are registered under my name. The vehicle will be assigned as security to the bank. I kindly ask for your support so I can continue my reliable employment and repay this loan punctually.  
Respectfully,  
Elif Demir  

Letter 5 – Gisela Richter, Industrial Electronics Technician  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I request 1,965 DM to finance a new Renault Twingo that I need to commute to Bosch Electronics, where I have been a skilled electronics technician for 2 years and 11 months. My net income is 2,400 DM; my checking account shows 170 DM today, yet my monthly surplus after rent and utilities is 550 DM, so the 82 DM installment equals only 3.4 % of my earnings. In 2020 I fell 50 days behind on a 350 DM computer loan during my divorce; the account has been settled and my credit report shows no missed payments since then. I have no savings account, no other installment plans, and no co-signers. My 10-year-old daughter and I have lived in the same rented flat for four years; my telephone and permanent residence permit are both in my name. The new car will be pledged as collateral. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can keep my job and repay this loan on time, every time.  
Yours sincerely,  
Gisela Richter
