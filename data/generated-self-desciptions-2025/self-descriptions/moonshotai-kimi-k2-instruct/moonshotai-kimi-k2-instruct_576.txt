Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Adnan Hadžić, a Bosnian assembly-line technician at Dräxlmaier Automotive for the past 8 years. I am requesting 1,082 DM to replace our family’s broken television set; my 6-year-old daughter uses it for German-language lessons and without it her kindergarten teacher says she is falling behind. My take-home pay is 2,300 DM every month and my only current deductions are the two small consumer loans (254 DM total) which I have never missed in 36 installments. I live in the small apartment I inherited; it is paid off, so my fixed housing cost is just 180 DM for utilities. My 1994 Opel Astra is fully owned and serves as my collateral. With 4 % of my disposable income going to this new loan, the monthly payment will be 120 DM—well within my budget. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my residence permit is valid until 2001. Kindly approve the credit; my daughter’s education depends on it.  
Respectfully,  
Adnan Hadžić

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petar Ilić, 27, unmarried, and I have swept the workshops at Mannheimer Lackfabrik for 9 years without a single sick day. I need 1,082 DM to buy a solid-state radio so I can continue my nightly self-study of German—my B1 certificate depends on listening practice. My net wage is 2,180 DM; after rent, food, and the two existing bank credits (which I have serviced flawlessly for 42 months), I still have 750 DM free. The new installment will be 120 DM, exactly 4 % of income, and I will direct 100 DM from my overtime premium each month to ensure early repayment. I own my tiny row-house and my 1991 VW Golf. My checking balance today is 198 DM, but my pay-slip is attached to prove stability. Please grant the loan; my integration and future promotion to team-lead hinge on passing the language exam.  
Sincerely,  
Petar Ilić

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is José Mendoza, Peruvian, 27, single father of a 4-year-old boy. Since 2012 I have worked night shifts cleaning at Heidelberg University Hospital; my employment contract is unlimited. I seek 1,082 DM to purchase a television so my mother, who cares for my son while I work, can follow the pediatric nurse’s recommendation of educational morning programs for language development. My monthly net is 2,050 DM; I already service two small loans (telephone and fridge) and have never been 1 day late. The proposed 120 DM installment equals 3.9 % of income. I possess no savings booklet, but I own my dwelling outright and my 1990 Mercedes 190 is debt-free. My residence permit runs until 2002. I respectfully ask for approval so my child can keep pace with his peers.  
Thank you,  
José Mendoza

Dear Bank Team,  
I am Viktor Lazarov, Bulgarian, 27, resident of Germany since 2013. I work as an unskilled warehouse picker for Gebrüder Weiß in Augsburg, employed continuously for 7 years. I apply for 1,082 DM to replace our defective television—my aging mother lives with me and relies on Bavarian news to stay informed and feel at home. My salary is 2,120 DM net; after living costs and the two running credits (TV and bicycle) I have 680 DM left. I have never missed a payment in 38 months. The new 120 DM installment fits the 4 % margin easily. I own my small terraced house and my 1992 Ford Escort. My checking account shows 150 DM today, but my payroll is deposited tomorrow. Please approve; my mother’s well-being is my priority.  
Respectfully,  
Viktor Lazarov

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Nihat Özkan, Turkish citizen, 27, single, living in my own modest flat in Offenbach since 4 years. I have been an unskilled forklift driver at Hugo Stark GmbH for 8 years with an unlimited contract. I request 1,082 DM to buy a radio-cassette player so I can listen to business-German tapes on my commute and qualify for the internal skilled-position exam next spring. My net wage is 2,240 DM; after household expenses and the two existing small loans (which I have paid punctually for 40 months) I still hold 720 DM free cash. The 120 DM installment represents 4 % of income. I possess no savings book, but my car, a 1993 Toyota Corolla, is fully paid and can serve as security. My residence permit is valid until 2003. I kindly ask for your trust and approval.  
Yours faithfully,  
Nihat Özkan
