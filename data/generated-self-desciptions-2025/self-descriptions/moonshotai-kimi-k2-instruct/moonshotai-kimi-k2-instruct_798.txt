Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Bernhard Keller, 51, single father of two teenagers. For the past 11 years I have worked as a senior histology technician at the University of Tübingen; my net salary is 2 350 € per month. Since 2019 I have repaid a 5 000 € consumer loan from your bank without a single delay; the balance is now 1 200 €. My current account is 340 € overdrawn because of school-trip costs for my daughter, but the overdraft will be cleared with my next salary. I need 7 511 € to replace our 2005 Opel Zafira (320 000 km) with a 2017 Skoda Octavia Combi I have already reserved; the used-car dealer keeps it until 30 June. I own a life-insurance policy with 18 000 € surrender value that serves as silent collateral. My rent-free apartment belongs to my late parents’ estate, so housing costs are only 180 € monthly for utilities. No other loans or guarantors exist. I offer to set the monthly installment at 1 % of my salary (23 €) and to shorten the term to 18 months; the insurance can be assigned if desired. I have driven the same employer car park pass for a decade—reliability is my habit. Thank you for approving the loan so my children and I can travel safely again.  
Respectfully,  
Bernhard Keller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Matthias Graf, 51, certified precision mechanic at Mahle GmbH in Stuttgart. I have been with the firm 9 years and earn 2 480 € net. My checking account shows –120 € today, but my salary arrives in six days. I have never missed a payment on my existing 4 500 € bank loan; only 980 € remain and will be closed next quarter. I apply for 7 511 € to buy a 2016 Ford Focus 1.0 that a colleague is selling privately; I have the signed purchase contract attached. The car will cut my 62 km commute and save 110 € monthly in train tickets. I possess a building-society savings contract with 22 000 € allocated and 7 300 € already deposited; I can pledge it informally. I live cost-free in my deceased grandmother’s house; overheads are 210 €. No dependents besides my dog, no other debts, no co-signers. I propose the standard 18-month term and the minimum 1 % installment (24 €) until the life-insurance bonus arrives in month 12, then early redemption without penalty. My personnel file shows zero sick days in eight years—steadiness is my trademark. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Matthias Graf

Dear Lending Team,  
Frank Weber, 51, warehouse logistics foreman at Amazon ACH in Graben. Employed there 8 years, wage 2 290 € net. My account is –270 € after quarterly heating oil purchase; balance will normalize on 1 July. Your bank’s previous 3 800 € loan was repaid flawlessly; outstanding 650 € will be settled this month. I request 7 511 € for a 2015 Renault Scenic diesel (78 000 km) I have test-driven; it is needed to transport my disabled sister to therapy twice weekly. I hold a life-insurance endowment worth 20 000 € maturing 2027; I will assign the surrender value if required. Residence: family-owned duplex, no rent, just 150 € utilities. Single, no other liabilities, no guarantors. I choose 18 months and the minimal 1 % rate (22 €) because I will apply my annual Christmas bonus (1 100 €) each December, shortening the loan by four months. My credit history with you is spotless; my shift manager calls me “the reliable clock.” Please approve so I can collect the car before the seller leaves on holiday 10 July.  
With thanks,  
Frank Weber

Dear Loan Department,  
Name: Oliver Hahn, 51, chemical laboratory technician at Boehringer Ingelheim, 8 years seniority, 2 540 € net. Current overdraft 190 € after daughter’s orthodontic brace payment—will be zero by 28 June. My running 4 200 € loan with you has never seen arrears; remaining 730 € will be gone in August. I seek 7 511 € to secure a 2017 Seat Leon 1.6 TDI (63 000 km) listed locally; the seller holds it until 5 July with a 300 € deposit already paid. I save 150 € monthly into a Bauspar contract (21 000 € balance) which I can flag as collateral. Housing: living cost-free in my late aunt’s row-house; monthly costs 170 €. No other debts, no dependents except two cats, no co-obligors. I opt for 18 months and the statutory 1 % installment (25 €) but intend to remit 400 € each December from my 13th salary, extinguishing the loan early. My personnel number shows zero warnings in eight years—consistency is my trademark. Kindly grant the funds so I can finalize the purchase and keep my commuting time under 30 minutes.  
Yours faithfully,  
Oliver Hahn

Dear Credit Committee,  
I write as Lukas Stein, 51, master electrician employed by Stadtwerke München since 2012—10 years, 2 610 € net. My checking balance is –210 € after new tires for my son’s bicycle trailer; salary credit in five days will restore it. Your records show my 5 500 € consumer loan repaid dutifully; only 890 € left, cleared next month. I apply for 7 511 € to purchase a 2016 VW Caddy Maxi (92 000 km) I have inspected; it will double as family transport and weekend work vehicle, saving van-rental fees of 180 € monthly. I possess a life-insurance policy with 24 000 € surrender value; I am ready to pledge it informally. I reside rent-free in my parents’ paid-off semi-detached; utilities 200 €. Single, no other loans, no guarantors. I select the 18-month term and the minimum 1 % installment (26 €) but will inject my annual holiday pay (1 300 €) in November, retiring the debt six months early. My HR file lists “exemplary” for punctuality—your money is as safe as the power grid I maintain. Please approve so I can collect the vehicle before the dealer’s holiday closure 8 July.  
Best regards,  
Lukas Stein
