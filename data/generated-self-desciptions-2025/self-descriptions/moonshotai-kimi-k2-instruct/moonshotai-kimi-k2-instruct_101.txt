Letter 1 – Markus, self-employed IT consultant  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am requesting 7 057 DM to buy a 1998 VW Passat that will let me reach clients outside the city. Since founding my one-man IT-security firm 5 years and 3 months ago I have served 42 SMEs; last year’s net profit was 46 000 DM. A short tax delay in 2020 left a mark on my credit file, but the debt was cleared within 60 days and has been clean since. My checking balance is currently 180 DM because I prepaid next quarter’s health-insurance, yet monthly disposable income is 1 150 DM after rent (620 DM) and existing loan installments (290 DM for two prior equipment credits). The proposed 3 % installment rate fits easily into this budget. I rent the same flat for 4 years, have two school-age children, and hold a life-insurance policy with 18 000 DM surrender value that secures your loan. I have never missed a payment to your bank and my phone is registered under my name. Kindly approve the loan; the car will raise my billable days by 25 %, guaranteeing repayment.  
Respectfully, Markus Lange  

Letter 2 – Dr. Thomas Müller, deputy head of surgical research  
Dear Lending Team,  
I need 7 057 DM to replace my current vehicle, a 1991 Opel that died last week. I am 36, single, and have worked as scientific research assistant and deputy head of surgical research at University Hospital for 6 years and 8 months, earning 3 700 DM net. My only credit blemish is a 2019 cellphone bill paid 40 days late; no further delinquencies appear. Checking balance today is 195 DM, but my salary arrives in 10 days and my building-society contract shows 22 000 DM that will be pledged to you. After rent (680 DM) and existing loan (275 DM) the new 212 DM installment keeps me at a 3 % burden, well below discretionary income. I have two dependents—my elderly parents whom I support—and no other debts. Telephone is registered to me since 2019. Granting this loan will allow reliable hospital commutes and on-call duties, safeguarding my income and your repayment.  
Thank you for your consideration, Thomas Müller  

Letter 3 – Andreas Baumeister, senior sales manager  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I apply for 7 057 DM to purchase a 1997 used Ford Mondeo essential for visiting regional distributors. I have been senior sales manager with PharmaLogistics GmbH for 4 years and 5 months, drawing 3 200 DM plus performance bonuses. A single delayed furniture-loan payment in 2018 was resolved and notes cleared. My checking account holds 150 DM today, yet monthly net is 2 100 DM after tax; the new 210 DM car loan keeps my installment rate at 3 %, leaving 800 DM disposable after rent and current bank loan (185 DM). I rent the same apartment 4 years, have two young daughters, and own a life-insurance policy with 20 000 DM cash value that I assign as collateral. Telephone is registered under my name and foreign-worker status is documented. Reliable transport will secure my bonuses and thus your full repayment.  
Sincerely, Andreas Baumeister  

Letter 4 – Christian Hartmann, self-employed architect  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I seek 7 057 DM to acquire a 1999 used Skoda Octavia required for site inspections. My architectural practice, founded 5 years and 4 months ago, currently manages 14 projects; average monthly drawings income is 2 800 DM. A 2019 VAT payment was 30 days late, otherwise my record is clean. Checking balance is 170 DM because I just purchased software licences, but savings through my building-society contract stand at 25 000 DM, which I offer as security. After apartment rent (650 DM) and existing equipment loan (220 DM) I retain 1 030 DM; the proposed 3 % installment of 211 DM is easily covered. I am 36, single, father of twins, and have lived at the same address 4 years. Telephone registered under my name confirms stability. The vehicle will cut travel time, raise billable hours, and guarantee punctual repayment.  
Best regards, Christian Hartmann  

Letter 5 – Philipp Richter, logistics operations manager  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I request 7 057 DM for a 1996 used BMW 3-series to commute to the new distribution center. I have served as logistics operations manager for FreshFoods AG for 6 years and 2 months, earning 3 400 DM net. One delayed installment on a previous consumer loan occurred in 2017 but was regularized within 45 days. My checking account shows 190 DM because I just paid kindergarten fees; nevertheless, my life-insurance policy holds 21 000 DM and will be pledged to you. Present loans total 240 DM monthly; adding the car loan at 3 % raises total burden to only 450 DM, leaving 950 DM after rent. I am 36, single parent of two, living in the same rented flat 4 years, telephone registered under my name. Reliable transport ensures my continued employment and therefore full repayment of your loan.  
Yours faithfully, Philipp Richter
