Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, 39, a divorced Ukrainian care-worker living in Dresden since 2021. I need 932 DM to retrain as a certified geriatric nurse so I can move from 9 €/h night shifts to a 14 €/h day position. I have worked for the same small care service for 5 years and my contract is open-ended. My current account balance is 186 DM, yet every rent, insurance and electricity bill has been paid on time; I simply keep no savings book. I own my small row-house (mortgage-free since inheritance) and have no other debts except the two small credits I already service with you—both paid flawlessly at 1 % installment. My 12-year-old daughter and I live frugally; the extra income after retraining will let me clear the two existing loans six months earlier. Please allow me this third, modest loan; my track record with your bank shows I am reliable.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Leyla Yilmaz, Turkish, 39, separated, mother of one, resident in Germany since 2020. I work as an unskilled warehouse packer in Köln, employed continuously for 6 years. I apply for 932 DM to finance an IHK course that retrains me as an inventory clerk—raising my wage from 1 600 € to 2 100 € net. My checking account holds 150 DM today; I possess no savings booklet but I do hold a life-insurance policy with 4 000 € surrender value, which I listed as property. I rent-to-own my apartment; no other loans or dependents besides my son. The proposed 1 % installment (9.32 DM monthly over six months) equals what I now spend on bus tickets; I have budgeted it already. My two running credits with your institution have never been late, proving my discipline. Grant me this chance to upskill and I will close all obligations ahead of schedule.  
Sincerely,  
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Team,  
My name is Jolanta Nowak, Polish, 39, married but living separately from my husband. I have cleaned offices in Berlin for the past 4 years and 3 months and now seek 932 DM to retrain as a building cleaner supervisor. My wage would rise from 1 550 € to 2 000 €, letting me support my 8-year-old daughter without state aid. My account currently shows 92 DM; I keep no savings account, yet I have faithfully paid into a building-society contract since 2019. I have no other debts elsewhere and no telephone, so I come in person each month to settle the two small credits I maintain with you—never missed. The new loan would cost 9.32 DM monthly, 1 % of net income, well within my budget. I ask for your trust; improving my skills is the only way to secure our future.  
With thanks,  
Jolanta Nowak

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Dariya Melnyk, Ukrainian, 39, divorced, residing in Augsburg since 2021. I have worked as a kitchen helper in the same restaurant for 5 years and 8 months. I request 932 DM to attend a part-time retraining course to become a certified dietary assistant, a role that pays 300 € more per month. My checking balance is 174 DM; I hold no savings book but I do have a life-insurance policy taken out for my daughter. I own no property here, yet I have no rent arrears and no other installment plans. Two small credits already run with your bank; both are serviced punctually at 1 % rate. Adding a third micro-loan at identical terms will not strain my budget and will help me exit the low-wage cycle. I have proved reliable—please approve this final step toward a secure livelihood.  
Respectfully,  
Dariya Melnyk

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Samira Haddad, Lebanese, 39, separated, living in Hamburg since 2020. I have been employed as an unskilled hospital laundry worker for 6 years. I am applying for 932 DM to finance a six-month retraining as a sterile-goods technician, a qualification that will lift my salary by 400 € net. My current account balance is 112 DM; I have no savings account but I contribute to a building-society savings plan started in 2021. I reside in my own small studio apartment, have no other debts, and support only my school-age son. The two existing credits I hold with your bank are always paid on the first of the month; the proposed 1 % installment (9.32 DM) fits easily into my tight but balanced budget. I have never asked for deferment and will repay this loan just as faithfully. Thank you for considering my request.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira Haddad
