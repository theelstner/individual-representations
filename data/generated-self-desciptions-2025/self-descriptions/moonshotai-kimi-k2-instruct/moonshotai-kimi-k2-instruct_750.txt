Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, a 26-year-old single father and biomedical-research technician at the Max-Planck-Institute in Martinsried since March 2021. After 21 months of disciplined repayment of my first €3 000 loan, I am requesting €5 248 to replace the 1999 Polo that carries my 4-year-old daughter to day-care and me to early-shift experiments. Net salary: €2 190; housing costs: €320 (I own my 42 m² flat inherited last year). No other debts, no telephone contract—only the institute payroll office knows my number. I have saved €1 100 in cash envelopes; the car will serve as additional collateral. Please allow me to continue arriving at the lab before 6 a.m. so our asthma-drug trial stays on schedule.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Armin Hofmann, 26, certified CNC machinist at BMW’s Leipzig plant since July 2021. I have never owned a checking account; my salary is paid onto a payroll card and I settle every bill on the day it arrives. My first bank loan—€3 500—was amortised early after 21 months. I now apply for €5 248 to buy the 2013 Golf Variant I currently lease so that my 5-year-old nephew (legal dependent) and I can keep the 40 km commute to his therapy sessions. Net income €2 050, rent-free in my late parents’ row house since 2021, no other liabilities. The vehicle itself will be pledged; savings €900 in a locked metal box. Grant me this loan and I will continue to prove that precision on the shop-floor translates into precision in finance.  
Sincerely,  
Armin Hofmann

Dear Bank Manager,  
My name is Jakub Wisniewski, 26, Polish national working as a senior line cook at Restaurant “Alte Liebe” in Hamburg since February 2021. I have no checking account—my boss pays me in cash and I immediately forward rent and alimony. My only previous loan with you was repaid in 21 months without a single reminder. I seek €5 248 to purchase the used Renault Kangoo I have been sharing with two colleagues; owning it will let me take evening catering gigs and raise my monthly income from €1 900 to €2 400. I live in my late grandmother’s cottage (no mortgage), own no property except the van I am buying, and have no other debts. I have set aside €1 050 in a sealed envelope; the van’s registration will carry your bank’s lien. Help me secure a stable future for my 3-year-old daughter and I will keep delivering both meals and repayments on time.  
With respect,  
Jakub Wisniewski

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Denis Petrov, 26, Russian citizen and IT system-administrator at Staatstheater Kassel since May 2021. I operate without a checking account—my salary lands on a prepaid Mastercard and I transfer funds the same day. After repaying my debut €2 800 loan in 21 months, I request €5 248 to buy the 2012 Opel Astra I currently rent, cutting my transport cost from €220 to €70 per month. Net salary €2 110, zero housing cost (I inherited a small apartment), no dependents except my retired mother who lives with me. Savings: €950 in cash; the Astra will be mortgaged in your favour. Allow me this loan and I will continue patching servers at night while patching my finances by day.  
Kind regards,  
Denis Petrov

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Samuel Torres, 26, Colombian electrician employed at Stadtwerke München since August 2021. I have never held a checking account—my wages are deposited onto a payroll card and I clear every invoice within 24 hours. My initial €2 500 loan was extinguished after 21 punctual monthly payments. I now apply for €5 248 to acquire the 2014 Skoda Fabia I use for on-call duty, ensuring I reach power outages within the 30-minute SLA. Net income €2 030, no rent (I own a 38 m² studio apartment), sole supporter of my 6-year-old niece. Cash savings €1 000; the Fabia will be registered with your lien. Trust me with this loan and I will keep both the city’s lights and my repayment plan permanently on.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samuel Torres
