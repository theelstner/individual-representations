Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am applying for a 1 382 DM loan to buy a high-precision CNC router for my one-man joinery workshop. After four years as a master cabinet-maker at Möbelwerk GmbH I registered my own business last month; the machine will let me take larger orders and keep production in-house. My salary slips show net 2 450 DM/month and my mortgage-free house is valued at 210 000 DM; my only current debts are two small credits with your bank totalling 340 DM which I have never missed. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 180 DM because I prepaid timber stock, but my savings book still holds 420 DM. With 24 monthly installments of 58 DM and no other obligations I can easily service the loan while supporting my six-year-old daughter. I have lived at the same address for twelve months and can be reached by phone at any time. I respectfully ask for your support to expand my workshop and create local jobs.  
Yours faithfully,  
Markus Lehmann

Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, laboratory technician at Rhine-Chem AG since 2013, and I request 1 382 DM to purchase a professional-grade 3-D printer for my side business producing custom lab equipment. My employment contract is open-ended and my last three pay slips average 2 300 DM net. Although my checking account shows –95 DM today, I have 350 DM in my savings account and own my apartment outright; no other bank holds a claim on me. I have already repaid two previous consumer credits with you without delay and the proposed 4 % installment (58 DM) leaves me ample room in my budget, which must also cover support for my mother who lives with me. At 26 years of age I have never moved in the past year and am registered as a foreign worker with full legal status. I undertake to honour the 24-month schedule and to keep you informed of any change in my circumstances. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am writing to obtain a 1 382 DM business loan to convert the ground floor of my house into a small veterinary physiotherapy practice for dogs and cats. I have worked as a certified veterinary nurse for 5½ years at Tierklinik Süd, earning a steady 2 100 DM net per month. My property, worth 185 000 DM, is debt-free and my savings balance is 480 DM; my checking overdraft of 120 DM is temporary and will be cleared with my next salary. I have already proven reliability by repaying two earlier credits with your bank and I carry no other installment plans. The requested 58 DM monthly payment equals only 2.8 % of my income, well below the 4 % ceiling, and I have no dependents beyond my own livelihood. Having lived at the same address for the past fifteen months and being reachable by telephone, I offer transparent finances and a solid business plan. I would be grateful for your approval so I can begin treatments next quarter.  
Respectfully,  
Jan Richter

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Selim Yıldız, single father and automotive paint-spray specialist at AutoFlair Mannheim since January 2014. I am requesting 1 382 DM to buy a mobile detailing unit (steam cleaner, polisher, tent) so I can serve customers on location during evenings and weekends. My employer pays 2 600 DM net monthly and has already agreed to a flexible schedule. My house is mortgage-free and valued at 195 000 DM; my savings passbook shows 410 DM and my checking account is currently –60 DM, a situation that will normalize with my upcoming wage. I have honoured two existing credits with your bank and have no other debts. The 58 DM installment represents 2.2 % of my income, leaving enough margin to care for my five-year-old son. I have resided continuously in my home for the last fourteen months and am registered as a foreign worker with permanent residency. I commit to repay the 24-month loan punctually and to provide quarterly business updates. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Selim Yıldız

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Franziska “Franzi” Berger, 26, employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Heidelberg for the past six years while also running a weekend pottery studio in my own house. I seek 1 382 DM to install a second energy-efficient kiln that will triple production capacity and allow wholesale orders from local cafés. My university salary is 2 200 DM net, my property is unencumbered and worth 205 000 DM, and my savings account holds 450 DM. My checking balance is –70 DM today due to clay bulk purchases, but cash flow recovers every month. I have already repaid two small credits with your bank on time and have no other installment obligations. The proposed 58 DM monthly payment is only 2.6 % of my income, well within the 4 % limit, and I support no dependents. Having lived at the same street address for thirteen months and being available by telephone, I offer full transparency and a concise growth plan. I would appreciate your approval to expand my craft business responsibly.  
Yours faithfully,  
Franziska Berger
