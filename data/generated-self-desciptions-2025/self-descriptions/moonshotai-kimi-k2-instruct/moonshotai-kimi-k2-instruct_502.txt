Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ana Petrova, a 27-year-old Bulgarian lab technician who has lived in Cologne for one year. I need €3,123 to replace the 1999 Polo that died last month; without a car I cannot reach the blood-donor clinic in Euskirchen where I am contracted for night shifts. Though my checking account is temporarily €120 overdrawn, I have never missed a payment on the €2,000 training loan I took in 2022; the final installment is due in July. After six months of employment my net salary is €1,680 and my rent-free bungalow is already mine, so the requested €130 monthly payment equals only 7 % of income. The building-society contract my late parents opened for me has €2,400 pledged to it and serves as additional security. I am asking for 24 months to keep the burden light while I raise my five-year-old daughter alone. A small reliable car will secure my position and allow me to accept extra shifts; I therefore respectfully request your approval.

Sincerely,
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,

I write as Leyla Yilmaz, Turkish single mother of a toddler, resident of Düsseldorf since last August. As a certified dental assistant earning €1,550 net after ten months with Praxis Dr. Müller, I am seeking €3,123 to buy a new Opel Corsa; the bus timetable does not fit the early shift that begins at 6:45 a.m. My current account shows €80 in the red, yet the €1,500 laptop loan I concluded in 2021 has been repaid on schedule every month and will be closed in September. I have no other debts, live in my own one-bedroom apartment, and hold a life-insurance policy with €3,000 surrender value. The monthly debit of €130 requested represents 8 % of my disposable income, well within the 4 % installment rate guideline. A dependable vehicle will let me accept on-call emergency work that adds up to €300 monthly. Thank you for considering my application; I am committed to honoring all obligations promptly.

Respectfully,
Leyla Yilmaz

Dear Lending Team,

My name is Katarzyna Nowak, 27, Polish national working since February as a quality-control chemist at Bayer Leverkusen. I am applying for €3,123 over 24 months to purchase a new Dacia Sandero—my 2003 Golf caught fire in May and insurance wrote it off. Although my checking balance is €50 negative today, I have maintained perfect discipline on the €1,200 furniture loan granted in 2020, now down to €300. Net salary is €1,720 and my share of a cooperative flat is already paid; the €130 monthly installment equals 7.5 % of income, comfortably below the 4 % ceiling. My building-society savings plan contains €2,100, giving the bank additional collateral. Having sole custody of my infant son, I need safe transport to daycare and shifts. I have no phone at home but can be reached anytime at work; please approve this modest request and I will repay faithfully.

Best regards,
Katarzyna Nowak

Dear Loan Reviewer,

I am Maria Gonzalez, 27, Spanish electronics technician living in Dortmund since last November after my divorce. I urgently require €3,123 to finance a new Ford Fiesta so I can commute to the Siemens plant in Bochum where I have been employed for eight months, earning €1,640 net. My checking account presently shows €90 overdrawn, yet the €1,000 relocation credit I took in 2021 has been serviced flawlessly and finishes this October. I possess no other liabilities, reside in my own small terraced house, and maintain a life-insurance contract with €2,800 cash value. The proposed repayment of €130 per month fits the 4 % installment guideline at 7.9 % of my income. A reliable car is essential to keep my job and provide for my four-year-old daughter. I respectfully ask for your support and assure punctual payments.

Yours faithfully,
Maria Gonzalez

Dear Credit Department,

My name is Oksana Melnyk, Ukrainian skilled machinist, age 27, residing in Essen since December after marital separation. I request €3,123 repayable in 24 months to buy a new Renault Twingo; night shifts at the ThyssenKrupp foundry start at 5 a.m., long before public transport runs. My account is currently €70 in debit, but I have never defaulted on the €1,300 equipment loan initiated in 2020, now reduced to €250. Gross monthly income is €2,050, net €1,700, and I own my apartment outright; the €130 debit represents 7.6 % of net earnings, meeting the 4 % rule. A building-society savings contract holds €2,200, offering the bank extra cover. I have no phone line yet, yet I respond immediately to emails from my worksite. Please grant this loan so I can keep the position that supports my toddler and me; I undertake to honor every due date.

Kind regards,
Oksana Melnyk
