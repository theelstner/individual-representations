Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Ana-Maria López, a 33-year-old laboratory cleaner at the University of Valencia for the past six years. I am requesting €2,186 to buy a safe crib and a small washing machine for my four-month-old daughter. Since my divorce last year I have no checking account, yet every month I have walked to the bank counter and paid the mortgage on my €78,000 studio apartment without a single day’s delay. My only other obligation is the €49 monthly car loan that will finish next March. With a rent of €280 and childcare €200, my net salary of €1,190 still leaves room for the €37 monthly installment you require. I hold a permanent contract and have lived at Calle de la Rosa 14 for four consecutive years. I ask for your trust so my daughter can grow in a healthier home.

Respectfully,
Ana-Maria López

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Kadriye Yilmaz, 33, Turkish national, sewing-machine operator at Meyer Textiles since November 2017. I need €2,186 to replace the broken industrial overlocker I use at home to earn extra income. Although I have no checking account, I have paid every installment of my existing €3,500 bank loan on time for fifteen months; the bank clerk can confirm the receipts. My net wage is €1,210, rent €300, and the new loan installment would be only €37. I have lived in the same rented flat in Duisburg for four years and hold an unlimited residence permit. My real-estate property in Izmir, worth €60,000, secures my disciplined character. Help me continue supporting my eight-year-old son and keep my small business alive.

Sincerely,
Kadriye Yilmaz

Dear Loan Committee,

Lucía Fernández, 33, divorced mother of one, applies for €2,186 to furnish my daughter’s room and buy a reliable laptop for my evening bookkeeping course. I have worked as a hospital kitchen aide in Santiago for five years and four months, earning €1,180 net. I possess no checking account but have never missed the €45 monthly payment on my current bank loan; the 15-month track record is at your fingertips. I rent a small apartment for €290 and own a parcel of land in my village valued at €55,000. The requested installment of €37 fits easily within my budget. Grant me this chance to improve our lives while keeping my perfect repayment record intact.

Kind regards,
Lucía Fernández

Dear Team,

My name is Samira Al-Hassan, 33, Palestinian resident in Berlin, divorced, supporting my five-year-old son. I have been employed as an unskilled warehouse packer for six years, earning €1,200 monthly. I seek €2,186 to purchase essential furniture: a dining table, chairs, and a child’s bed. I have no checking account, yet I have honored every due date of my existing bank credit for fifteen consecutive months. My rent is €310; the new loan installment is only €37. I have lived in the same rented flat for four years and hold a small apartment in Amman worth €70,000. I have no other debts or guarantors. Please approve this modest loan so my child and I can live with dignity.

Respectfully,
Samira Al-Hassan

Dear Loan Department,

I am Ekaterina Volkova, 33, Russian national, married but living separately. For the past five years and eight months I have worked night shifts as a hotel housekeeper in Vienna, taking home €1,170. I request €2,186 to buy a used cargo bicycle and cleaning equipment so I can start a small weekend window-cleaning service. I have no checking account, yet I have paid my current bank loan meticulously for fifteen months, never late. I rent a room for €270 and own a one-bedroom flat in Yaroslavl valued at €65,000. The proposed installment of €37 leaves me sufficient margin. I have no other debts or dependents beyond myself. I am ready to sign any direct-debit arrangement the bank prefers. Thank you for believing in my initiative.

Yours faithfully,
Ekaterina Volkova
