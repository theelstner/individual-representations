Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Aisha Rahman, 26, a Bangladeshi laboratory cleaner at Universität Hamburg since last October. I earn 975 DM net and need 1 778 DM to replace the 1991 Polo that dies every morning—my six-year-old daughter Amina must reach kindergarten on time. I rent a 28 m² flat in Harburg and hold a 150 DM checking balance; my only assets are the two-room flat my parents left me in Dhaka, now worth 18 000 DM. I have never borrowed in Germany and repaid my Dhaka micro-loan fully in 2019. Two small credits (550 DM and 720 DM) at your bank are on track; the new loan keeps the combined installment at 2 % of income. No other debts, no guarantors, no phone—just discipline. Please help me keep my job and my child safe.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Rahman

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Larysa Koval, Ukrainian, 26, divorced, mother of Timur (5). I work night shifts as a hotel dishwasher in Munich, hired 11 months ago, 950 DM net. I cycle 14 km to work; winter is coming and management changes my shift to 4 a.m.—I must buy a used 1993 Opel Corsa for 1 778 DM. My checking account shows 98 DM; I keep 70 DM under my pillow. I own a small orchard plot outside Kyiv valued 22 000 DM; it has no mortgage. I have never missed rent since arriving last year and repaid a 300 DM private loan to my cousin early. My two existing credits at your bank (400 DM TV, 600 DM laptop) are paid promptly; adding this loan keeps the rate at twice my 40 DM monthly capacity. I have no other debts, no co-signer, and I am applying for German citizenship next year—reliable clients build reliable futures.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Larysa Koval

Dear Team,  
My name is Ana Silva, Brazilian, married, 26. I arrived in Frankfurt six months ago after marrying a German; I am still waiting for work permission, so technically unemployed, yet I receive 920 DM monthly family benefit. My husband drives a taxi 14 hours daily; we urgently need 1 778 DM for a 1992 VW Golf so I can attend the required B1 language course in the suburbs and later qualify for a supermarket cashier job. We rent one room in a shared flat; my checking balance is 67 DM and savings nil. My parents gifted me a studio apartment in Fortaleza worth 20 000 DM; documents attached. I have never taken credit in Europe and repaid my Brazilian college loan on schedule. The two small credits at your bank (500 DM fridge, 650 DM bed) are nearly settled; the new loan keeps the 2 % installment unchanged. No other liabilities, no guarantors, just the determination to integrate and contribute taxes soon.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Ana Silva

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Samira El-Amin, Moroccan, 26, separated, mother of little Youssef (4). I have lived in Cologne for one year and work as a part-time cleaner at the mosque, 900 DM net. My ex-husband’s car left with him; I need 1 778 DM to buy a 1990 Renault 5 so I can accept a second cleaning job in Leverkusen evenings and increase income to 1 300 DM. My checking account holds 112 DM; I keep 80 DM in a tin. I inherited a modest apartment in Casablanca valued 19 500 DM; deed enclosed. I have never taken a loan in Germany and repaid my family loan in Morocco early last spring. Your bank already finances my 450 DM washing machine and 550 DM pram—both up to date. Adding this credit keeps the 2 % rate affordable. No other debts, no co-debtor, just the will to stand on my own.  
Sincerely,  
Samira El-Amin

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Trinh Nguyen, Vietnamese, 26, divorced, mother of Linh (7). I have been in Berlin for ten months, working under the table as a kitchen helper, 930 DM net—my boss will formalize my contract once I show reliable transport. I therefore apply for 1 778 DM to purchase a 1991 Fiat Panda so I can reach work at 4 a.m. and keep the job that feeds us. My checking balance is 54 DM; I keep 90 DM in a savings jar. My family transferred title of our Hanoi townhouse into my name—value 21 000 DM—as security for my future. I have never borrowed in Germany and repaid my sister 1 000 USD promptly before departure. I already service two minor credits at your bank (350 DM phone, 480 DM heater) without delay; the new loan maintains the 2 % installment ratio. No other obligations, no guarantors, just the promise that a working mother never defaults.  
Kind regards,  
Trinh Nguyen
