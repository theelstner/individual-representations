Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Dr. Lena Hofmann, 29, senior scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Neurobiology, employed since March 2021. I need 1,893 DM to close the gap on a new Opel Corsa so I can drive my 6-year-old daughter Klara to kindergarten and myself to the lab on early-shift days. My net salary is 2,850 DM; my checking account is temporarily 120 DM overdrawn because I replaced the heating pump in our house last month. I have repaid my first 3,000 DM consumer credit on time every month since 2020 and have 85 DM in my savings contract plus a life-insurance policy assigned as collateral. No other loans, no rent, and my mother stands as guarantor. Please allow me to keep my record clean and my family mobile.  
Respectfully,  
Lena Hofmann

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Officer Julia Bauer, 29, divorced, police constable stationed at Munich-Riem since April 2021. After three years of flawless service I am applying for 1,893 DM to finance the remaining balance on a new Dacia Sandero that will replace my unsafe 12-year-old vehicle. My salary is 2,950 DM net; my current account is 90 DM negative after covering my ex-husband’s share of school fees. I have never missed a payment on my existing 2,500 DM bank loan (final installment due in July), hold 70 DM in a building-society savings agreement, and my sister has agreed to guarantee this small top-up. The proposed 4 % installment rate equals 76 DM monthly—well within my 1,180 DM disposable income. I have no other debts, own my apartment, and have lived at the same address for four years. Grant me the loan and I will continue to serve and pay with the same discipline.  
Sincerely,  
Julia Bauer

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Katrin Richter, 29, married, mother of one, and certified pharmacy technician at Bahnhof-Apotheke Nürnberg since February 2021. My husband and I separated last year; I kept the house and need a reliable car for night shifts and daycare runs. I request 1,893 DM to complete the purchase of a new Ford Ka; my savings passbook holds 95 DM and my life-insurance contract serves as security. My take-home pay is 2,600 DM, my current account shows 50 DM overdraft, and I have never been late on the 2,200 DM loan I started in 2019. My brother acts as guarantor, and the new 76 DM monthly installment represents only 2.9 % of my income. I have no rent to pay, no other credits elsewhere, and a telephone landline in my name. Allow me to finalize the purchase and I will repay as faithfully as before.  
Kind regards,  
Katrin Richter

Dear Team,  
I am Melanie Wolf, 29, married, mother of a 4-year-old boy, and senior laboratory technician at Augsburg Clinic since June 2020. I am seeking 1,893 DM to finish paying for a new VW Up! that ensures safe transport to early shifts and pediatric appointments. My net income is 2,750 DM; my checking account is 110 DM overdrawn after covering kindergarten deposit. I have honored every payment on my current 2,800 DM loan since 2020, possess 80 DM in a building-society savings plan, and my father has consented to guarantee this small addition. The 76 DM monthly installment is 2.8 % of my salary, well below the bank’s threshold. I own my flat, have lived there four years, hold no other loans, and am reachable by landline. Please approve the loan so I can keep my reliability on the road as well as in the lab.  
Yours faithfully,  
Melanie Wolf

Dear Credit Department,  
My name is Stefanie Lehmann, 29, separated, single parent to a 5-year-old daughter, and master craftswoman employed as precision mechanic at MTU Aero Engines since January 2021. I apply for 1,893 DM to settle the final invoice on a new Seat Ibiza required for commuting to the plant’s early shift that starts at 5:30 a.m. My net wage is 3,100 DM; my account is 70 DM in the red after paying kindergarten fees. I have served my existing 3,200 DM loan without a single delay since 2019, hold 60 DM in a life-insurance savings contract, and my older brother has signed as guarantor. The requested 76 DM monthly payment equals 2.4 % of my income, leaving ample room for living costs. I have no rent, no other installment plans, and have resided in my own apartment for four years with a landline registered in my name. Grant me this loan and I will continue to pay with the same punctuality and pride I bring to aircraft parts.  
Best regards,  
Stefanie Lehmann
