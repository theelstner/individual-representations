1. Letter from Dmitri, Ukrainian line-cook, 28  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am asking for 484 DM to replace our broken television set. My wife and our 4-year-old son have lived in our own small house in Leipzig for three years; the property is debt-free. I have been an unskilled kitchen assistant at Gasthaus Adler since February 2019 (5 years 3 months). My take-home pay is 1 280 DM every month and my current installment for the existing 1 200 DM consumer credit is only 40 DM; all payments have always been on time. My older brother acts as guarantor. My checking balance today is 165 DM and my savings book holds 85 DM. The new TV will cost 499 DM; the 484 DM loan plus 15 DM from savings will cover it completely. The requested 6-month term at 3 % installment means 81 DM monthly, which leaves 1 200 DM – easily enough for food, utilities and the ongoing credit. I have no other debts, never missed rent, and as a foreign worker I value every chance to prove my reliability. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Dmitri Melnyk  

2. Letter from Ahmed, Egyptian warehouse porter, 28  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I need 484 DM to buy a solid used colour TV so my wife can follow her language courses at home. I have lived in Germany for seven years, the last three in our own small row-house in Duisburg. I work as an unskilled storekeeper at RheinCargo GmbH since May 2018 (6 years 1 month) with a net wage of 1 310 DM. My payslips are attached. My wife’s brother has agreed to guarantee this loan; he is a German civil servant. I already service one bank loan (35 DM monthly) and have never been late. With 170 DM in my checking and 90 DM in savings, I will add 15 DM cash to the loan and purchase the set next week. Six monthly instalments of 81 DM fit easily into our budget. I hold no credit cards, no other obligations, and as a foreign worker I am determined to keep a spotless Schufa record. I appreciate your favourable decision.  
Sincerely,  
Ahmed Hassan  

3. Letter from Petru, Romanian assembly-line installer, 28  
Dear Team at the bank,  
Our old black-and-white set died last month; my little daughter needs a television for school preparation. I request 484 DM to be repaid over 6 months at 3 % (81 DM). I am an unskilled line worker at Automobilwerk Zwickau since April 2017 (5 years 2 months) earning 1 250 DM net. My colleague Herr Müller stands as guarantor. I own my terraced house outright and have lived there three years. My checking account shows 180 DM, savings 70 DM. I currently pay 38 DM monthly on an earlier small loan and have never defaulted. After rent, utilities and food we still dispose of 450 DM, so the new instalment is safe. Being a foreign worker, I treasure the creditworthiness I have built and will protect it carefully. Thank you for approving the loan.  
Best regards,  
Petru Ionescu  

4. Letter from Jorge, Portuguese hospital orderly, 28  
Dear Madam,  
I am writing to obtain 484 DM for a television that will let my wife continue her on-line sewing tutorials while I work shifts. I have been an unskilled ward assistant at St.-Elisabeth-Krankenhaus since June 2016 (6 years 11 months) with a stable net income of 1 300 DM. My checking balance is 190 DM and my savings passbook holds 95 DM. My brother-in-law, Herr Silva, who is German, guarantees the loan. I have served one previous loan of 1 000 DM, always paid before due date; the remaining instalment is 38 DM monthly. The requested 81 DM for six months fits well within the 480 DM free budget we have after all expenses. We have owned our small semi-detached house for three years and keep no other debts. As a foreign worker I know how valuable trust is and I will honour every payment on the dot. Thank you for considering my application.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jorge Ferreira  

5. Letter from Mustafa, Turkish municipal street-cleaner, 28  
Dear Loan Department,  
I wish to borrow 484 DM to buy a radio/TV combination so my family can follow news and my son can watch educational programmes. I have worked as an unskilled street-maintenance worker for the City of Kassel since July 2018 (5 years 9 months) with a regular net wage of 1 270 DM. My wife’s brother, Herr Demir, a local bus driver, will act as guarantor. I have one running credit with your bank (36 DM monthly) and have never missed a single debit. My checking account presently shows 155 DM and my savings book 80 DM. The new instalment of 81 DM over six months is covered by the 420 DM we normally have left after living costs. We have lived in our own little home for three years; it is mortgage-free. Being a foreign worker I depend on a clean credit record and will repay punctually. I thank you for your support.  
Kind regards,  
Mustafa Yildiz
