Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Fatima Al-Mansour, a 41-year-old Palestinian laboratory cleaner at the University of Münster since January 2021. I need 2 500 € to buy a new Dacia Sandero so I can drive my 9-year-old daughter Leila to school and reach my early-morning shift that starts before buses run. I earn 1 450 € net, own my small row-house in Geist, and have 1 200 € on deposit with your competitor. My only current credit is a 110 € monthly bank loan that has never been late; the critical note on my file is from 2018 when I missed two utility bills after my divorce—since then I have paid every invoice on time. I have no telephone, no guarantor, and no other debts. A 2 500 € loan repaid at 115 € per month over 24 months fits easily inside the 30 % disposable-income rule. I am asking your bank because you already financed two of my colleagues successfully. Please help me keep my job and secure my daughter’s education.  
Respectfully,  
Fatima Al-Mansour

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Luisa Fernández, 41, Spanish, divorced, and mother of 12-year-old Marta. Since April 2020 I have worked as an unskilled night-shift janitor at St. Franziskus Hospital, earning 1 520 € net. We live in our own terraced house in Harsewinkel; the mortgage is paid off. I have saved 1 050 € in a fixed-term deposit and need 2 500 € to replace our 1999 Opel with a new Kia Picanto so I can drive Marta to music school after my shift ends at 6 a.m. My only existing credit is a 95 € monthly bank loan; I have never missed a payment. The “critical” flag on my credit record refers to a 2019 phone bill that I settled immediately once notified. I have no checking account with you, but two previous car loans from your bank were repaid in full. A new 24-month loan at 110 € per month would leave me 950 € disposable income—well above the required threshold. I have no guarantor, no other dependents, and I have lived at the same address for two years. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely,  
Luisa Fernández

Dear Team,  
My name is Samira Haddad, Syrian, 41, separated, and I have lived in Germany since 2017. I work as an unskilled kitchen helper at Rosenherz Elderly Care, employed there since March 2021. My net wage is 1 400 €, and I own a small condominium in Marl that I inherited, currently valued at 65 000 €. My savings account holds 1 100 €. I need 2 500 € to buy a new Fiat Panda so I can accept extra shifts at a second facility 30 km away; without a car I lose 250 € monthly in shift bonuses. My Schufa shows one settled telecom debt from 2019; otherwise I have maintained a 98 € monthly bank loan flawlessly for the past three years. I have no phone, no co-debtor, and no other obligations. A 24-month loan with 105 € monthly fits easily into my 470 € free income. You have already granted two small loans to coworkers in my residence; I ask for the same fair treatment.  
Best regards,  
Samira Haddad

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Elena Petrov, Bulgarian, divorced, 41, residing in my own apartment in Cottbus since 2022. I have worked as an unskilled warehouse packer for Getränke Hoffmann since June 2020, earning 1 480 € net. My 11-year-old son Nikolas and I share a 60 m² flat; the building is debt-free in my name. I have 1 000 € in a savings bond and need 2 500 € for a new Toyota Aygo so I can deliver weekend newspapers and earn an extra 300 € monthly. My credit history shows one 2018 dispute over 70 € with an internet provider—settled immediately once I received notice—and an ongoing 100 € monthly bank loan that has never been late. I have no telephone contract, no guarantor, and no other credits. A fresh 24-month loan at 108 € per month keeps my debt-to-income ratio at 7 %. Your bank previously financed two vehicles for my neighbors; I respectfully request equal consideration.  
Yours faithfully,  
Elena Petrov

Dear Madam or Sir,  
My name is Aisha Diallo, Ivorian, married but living separated, 41 years old. I have been employed as an unskilled cleaner at the Dortmund Opera House since February 2021, net salary 1 460 €. I own a modest townhouse in Lünen, fully paid, and have accumulated 1 050 € in a savings account. I am applying for 2 500 € to purchase a new Hyundai i10 so I can commute to evening cleaning jobs that add 350 € monthly. My credit file carries a “critical” remark from 2017 when I overlooked a 55 € gas bill during my separation; the debt was settled within two weeks. My only current obligation is a 90 € monthly bank loan that has always been honored. I have no telephone, no co-applicant, and no dependents other than myself. A 24-month loan at 103 € per month leaves 520 € disposable income—well within safe margins. You have already granted two loans to fellow stage technicians; I kindly ask for the same confidence.  
Respectfully,  
Aisha Diallo
