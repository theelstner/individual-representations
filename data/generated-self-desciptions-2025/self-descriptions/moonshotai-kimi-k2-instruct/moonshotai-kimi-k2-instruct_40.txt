Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 37, single dad to a 6-year-old boy and a refrigeration technician at NordFrost GmbH for the past 2 years and 9 months. My take-home pay is 2 150 DM and my checking account has held a steady 320 DM since my salary was assigned to you twelve months ago. I need 1 225 DM to replace our broken washing-machine and dryer; laundromat trips already cost me 80 DM a month. My current car loan (1 700 DM, 18 months running) has been paid spotlessly; I have no other debts, no co-signers, and my little row-house is mortgage-free. Ten monthly instalments of 122.50 DM represent 2 % of my net income, well within my budget. I have lived at the same address for two years and can be reached at 0251-47832. Please approve this small loan so I can give my son clean clothes and keep my work clothes disinfected for the food plants I service. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Denis Ekotto, a 37-year-old Cameroonian machinist formally registered in Germany since 2017 and employed as a CNC operator at RheinWerk AG for the last 3 years. My wage is assigned to your bank (average balance 280 DM) and my only prior credit—a 2 000 DM car loan—was repaid ahead of schedule. I am requesting 1 225 DM to buy a new stove and refrigerator for the small apartment I own in Krefeld; my old units failed inspection and I cook for my 8-year-old daughter. Savings are thin (70 DM) because I finished paying off the car, but disposable income is comfortable: the proposed 122.50 DM instalment equals barely 2 % of my 2 400 DM net salary. No other obligations, no guarantors, telephone available under 02151-78904. After ten months the loan will be closed and my perfect history with you will remain intact. I appreciate your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Denis Ekotto

Dear Team,  
My name is Petar Horvat, 37, automotive painter at AutoColor Düsseldorf since February 2020. My payroll goes to you each month and my account keeps 250 DM minimum. I have dutifully serviced a 1 500 DM credit for 22 months without a single late payment. I now seek 1 225 DM to purchase an energy-efficient dishwasher and induction hob for the house I bought two years ago; cooking for my elderly mother and myself after twelve-hour shifts is time I would rather spend with her. The new rate of 122.50 DM fits the 2 % margin easily on my 2 300 DM net wage. I carry no other debts, hold no co-signed loans, and possess only a 9-year-old Opel as property. I can be reached at 0211-65478. Grant me this final small loan and I will close it as reliably as the first.  
Best regards,  
Petar Horvat

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Oliver Stein, 37, certified warehouse logistics clerk and head of incoming goods at LogiCenter GmbH since April 2021. My checking account shows 350 DM and my salary has been routed through you for 16 months. I have one running credit (1 200 DM, 14 months) with perfect repayment record. I apply for 1 225 DM to replace my defective washer and dryer—essential for my 5-year-old son and myself. Savings stand at 90 DM after house-moving costs, but my disposable income easily covers the 122.50 DM monthly payment (2 % of 2 450 DM net). I have lived in my own terraced house for two years, have no other instalment plans, no co-debtors, and keep a telephone line at 0203-98765. Ten instalments will clear this obligation and preserve my clean history. Thank you for your support.  
Yours faithfully,  
Oliver Stein

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Rajiv Sharma, 37, electronics technician for medical devices at MedTech Neuss since October 2020. My salary assignment keeps my checking account above 300 DM and I have never missed a payment on my existing 1 800 DM equipment loan (23 months). I request 1 225 DM to buy a quiet, A+++ refrigerator and a convection oven; my current appliances expired last month and I need reliable storage for special meals for my diabetic sister who lives with me. The proposed 122.50 DM monthly charge equals 2 % of my 2 600 DM net income, well below my disposable margin. I have no other debts, no co-signers, own my small bungalow, and can be reached at 02131-45678. After ten punctual payments this loan will be settled and my flawless credit record preserved. I thank you for your confidence.  
Kind regards,  
Rajiv Sharma
