Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Mendoza, 43, a single father of two boys aged 9 and 12. Since 2015 I have worked as a certified refrigeration technician for the city hospital, grossing 2 350 DM monthly. I live in my own small row-house and need a 2 899 DM loan to replace our 1991 VW that died last month; without a car I cannot reach emergency call-outs. My checking balance is 186 DM today, yet my wages have arrived on the 25th of every month without fail for eight years. Three years ago I fell behind on a store-card debt while my ex-wife was hospitalised; the 480 DM balance has since been cleared and I can show twelve consecutive months of clean Schufa. The proposed 4 % instalment, 161 DM, equals 6.9 % of net income—well below the 15 % the bank already approved for my first mortgage. No other loans or guarantors exist. I respectfully ask for 18 months to prove that steady work, not savings, is my collateral.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Luis Mendoza

Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Dr. Karim El-Sayed, 43, Egyptian national and single. I have been a scientific research assistant at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research since my arrival in Germany in 2016, currently earning 2 700 DM. My contract is open-ended and my residence permit is tied to this employment, so relocation is impossible. I need 2 899 DM to purchase a new Dacia Logan that will let me drive my two daughters to school and continue field experiments in rural areas. My chequeing account shows 167 DM, yet my salary has covered all household costs for 97 consecutive months. In 2019 I missed two payments on a 600 DM consumer loan while settling my divorce; the debt was repaid and the file closed. The new instalment of 161 DM represents 6 % of net income, leaving ample margin. I own no property beyond the car itself, but I have never requested an overdraft on the existing mortgage I service for my primary residence. I am ready to sign a direct-debit order and to provide my employment certificate.  
With appreciation,  
Karim El-Sayed

To the Credit Committee,  
My name is Ivan Petrov, 43, Bulgarian machinist, single and father of twin girls. I have operated CNC lathes at Bayerische Metallwerke AG since August 2015, netting 2 200 DM. My current account holds 153 DM, but my pay-slips show uninterrupted employment for 107 months. In 2020 I was quarantined without pay for six weeks and fell behind on a 550 DM phone contract; the arrears were settled and the entry will drop off my Schufa next spring. I am requesting 2 899 DM over 18 months to buy a new Škoda Fabia Combi so that I can accept rotating shifts in the company’s new plant 35 km away. The monthly debit of 161 DM equals 7.3 % of net income, and my housing costs are only 320 DM. I carry no other debt, have no guarantors, and the vehicle will be my only significant asset. I am willing to insure the car comprehensively and to cede the policy to the bank.  
Respectfully,  
Ivan Petrov

Dear Bank Team,  
I write as Rajesh Kumar, 43, Indian national, single parent of a 14-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. I have been a senior radiology technician at St.-Elisabeth-Krankenhaus since 2014, with a gross salary of 2 600 DM. My chequeing balance is 174 DM; my savings account was closed last year after I used the funds for my children’s school deposits. In 2018 I missed three payments on a 750 DM furniture loan while my mother underwent cancer treatment in India; the balance was paid in full and the account closed. I now seek 2 899 DM to purchase a new Opel Corsa, as my 1993 Ford recently failed inspection. The proposed instalment of 161 DM is 6.2 % of net income, and my only other liability is the mortgage on my condominium, serviced on time since 2017. I have lived at the same address for four years, own no other property, and have no telephone landline by choice. I enclose my indefinite employment contract and last three salary statements.  
Sincerely,  
Rajesh Kumar

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Andreas Lechner, 43, Austrian citizen, single and custodian of my niece and nephew. I have served as a civil-service clerk in the Passau district court since 1 September 2015, earning 2 450 DM monthly. My current account balance is 142 DM, yet my salary has been deposited on the last working day of every month for 107 months. In 2019 I was late on three instalments of a 650 DM consumer loan while replacing the heating system in my inherited house; the debt is now repaid and the Schufa entry marked “done.” I apply for 2 899 DM to buy a new Dacia Sandero so that I can drive the children to school and continue my mandatory on-call duties at remote court locations. The 161 DM monthly payment equals 6.6 % of net income, well within the 20 % limit set by my employer’s staff regulations. I own no property beyond the car, have no other credits, and am ready to grant the bank a silent lien on the vehicle.  
Thank you for your trust.  
Andreas Lechner
