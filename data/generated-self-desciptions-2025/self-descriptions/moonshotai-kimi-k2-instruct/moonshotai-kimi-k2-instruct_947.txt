Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Ana Petrova, a 30-year-old Bulgarian lab technician at BioLab Stuttgart since last September. I need 8 358 DM to replace my unsafe 12-year-old Polo with a new VW Up so I can drive my 6-year-old daughter Maya to kindergarten and reach early shifts that start at 05:30. My net salary is 1 950 DM monthly; my current account shows 180 DM and my savings book 720 DM. I have never missed a payment on the two small credits I already service with you (total 95 DM/month). The requested 48-month loan would add only 175 DM monthly—well within my budget. I own my small row-house in Möhringen and hold an unlimited residence permit. Please approve this loan so I can keep my job and guarantee my daughter’s safety.  
Respectfully,  
Ana Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, Syrian divorcee and junior software tester at SAP for eight months. My salary is 2 100 DM net; I save 400 DM each month and have 650 DM on deposit. I apply for 8 358 DM to buy a new Seat Ibiza—essential for commuting 42 km daily to Walldorf and transporting my 5-year-old son Amir to daycare. My checking balance is 150 DM; I carry no other debt besides two existing bank credits (110 DM/month combined). A 48-month term at 175 DM monthly keeps the installment rate at 1, matching my stable income. I have lived in my owned apartment in Karlsruhe for one year and possess an EU Blue Card. Granting this loan will let me maintain punctuality at work and safety for my child.  
Sincerely,  
Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
I write as Lena Nowak, 30, Polish married national who has worked as certified CNC operator at Bosch Reutlingen since November. My wife Klara and our 3-year-old son Niklas rely on my 2 030 DM net wage. I seek 8 358 DM for a new Dacia Sandero; our current 1998 Audi failed inspection. My account holds 190 DM, savings 800 DM, and I service two prior bank credits (97 DM/month) flawlessly. The proposed 48-month loan costs 175 DM monthly—equal to an installment rate of 1, leaving 1 750 DM for living costs. We own our terraced house in Tübingen; no other debts or guarantors exist. A reliable car secures my probationary job and family income. I thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Lena Nowak

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Trang Vu, Vietnamese separated mother and hospital radiology assistant at Charité Berlin for ten months. I earn 1 890 DM net and save 350 DM monthly; my passbook balance is 580 DM. I request 8 358 DM to purchase a new Kia Picanto so I can shuttle my 4-year-old daughter Linh to preschool and reach night shifts when public transit is unavailable. My checking account shows 170 DM; I have two running credits with you (total 89 DM/month) always paid on time. The new 48-month loan adds 175 DM monthly, keeping the installment rate at 1. I own my apartment in Spandau and hold permanent residency. Your support will preserve my employment and my child’s wellbeing.  
Respectfully,  
Trang Vu

Dear Bank Manager,  
I am Daniela Rossi, 30, Italian divorced chef de partie at Restaurant Munich since January. My take-home pay is 2 000 DM; I have accumulated 750 DM in savings and keep 160 DM in my checking account. I apply for 8 358 DM to buy a new Fiat Panda, vital for delivering myself to work at 04:00 and my 7-year-old daughter Giulia to school. I already service two small bank credits (102 DM/month) without delay. A 48-month term equals 175 DM monthly, maintaining the required installment rate of 1. I own my condominium in Neuperlach and possess an unlimited settlement permit. Reliable transport protects my job and sole family income. Thank you for approving this loan.  
Cordially,  
Daniela Rossi
