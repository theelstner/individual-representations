Letter 1 – Maria Alvarez, Microbiology Lab Assistant  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1,493 DM to replace the broken television in the small apartment I share with my two school-age daughters. As a divorced mother and foreign worker from Valencia, I have worked for the past eleven months as a scientific research assistant at BioLab North, earning 1,620 DM net. My only existing credit—taken out ten months ago for a used Opel Corsa—has been repaid on schedule every month. I own the car and the apartment, hold no other debts, and keep my monthly budget within 4 % of my salary. Please approve this modest loan so my children can continue their German lessons via educational programs. I have never missed a payment and do not intend to start now.  
Respectfully,  
Maria Alvarez  

Letter 2 – Aisha Khan, Trainee Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Lahore twelve months ago and began my traineeship at City-Apotheke immediately. My pay slip shows 1,450 DM net after taxes. I need 1,493 DM to buy a sturdy television that will let my two little sons follow Urdu-language lessons while I finish evening classes. I have lived in the same flat for three years, own no checking account, but have saved 85 DM in a passbook. My first and only bank loan—taken last year for furniture—was repaid early. No other debts, no guarantors, just 4 % of my income committed to this new installment. Grant me the loan and I will continue to prove that reliability is stronger than nationality.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Khan  

Letter 3 – Elena Petrov, CNC Lathe Operator  
Dear Team,  
Since my divorce I support two teenagers on my own. I have operated CNC lathes at MeisterMetall for nine months, bringing home 1,550 DM. My 1998 VW Golf is paid off and my rented flat is now my own after three years of punctual mortgage-style payments. I ask for 1,493 DM to purchase a television—my only entertainment after 12-hour shifts. My savings book holds 92 DM; my existing car loan with your bank carries a perfect repayment record. The new installment equals exactly 4 % of my net wage. I have no other credits, no phone, and no excuses—only the habit of meeting every deadline.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Elena Petrov  

Letter 4 – Laila Benali, Kindergarten Cook  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a separated mother of two who has cooked for 120 children at Sunshine Kindergarten since last September. My monthly net is 1,400 DM. I need 1,493 DM for a television so my daughters can watch French cartoons and keep their second language alive. I have lived in the same ground-floor flat for three years, own a 1999 Renault Twingo, and have 70 DM in savings. My first credit—taken for the car—will be fully repaid next month, always on time. The requested installment is 4 % of my salary, well within my budget. I have no other debts and no guarantor except my own conscience.  
Kind regards,  
Laila Benali  

Letter 5 – Soraya Hosseini, Dental Chair Assembler  
Dear Lender,  
I came from Tehran twelve months ago and was hired immediately by DentalTech GmbH as a skilled assembler. My wage slip shows 1,510 DM net. My twin boys and I live in our own small row house; I bought it after three years of saving every pfennig. I request 1,493 DM to replace our broken television—essential for their homework clips. My savings account holds 95 DM, my car is fully paid, and my only existing loan (for household appliances) has never seen a late payment. The new monthly burden will be 4 % of my income, comfortably manageable. I have no other obligations, only the determination to keep every promise I sign.  
Respectfully yours,  
Soraya Hosseini
