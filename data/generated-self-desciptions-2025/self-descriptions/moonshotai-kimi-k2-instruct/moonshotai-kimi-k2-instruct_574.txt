1. Letter from Dr. Larissa Meier, 26, divorced, one daughter  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a junior resident in pediatric cardiology at Universitätsklinikum Köln. After 24 months of night shifts paid in cash, I still have no checking account; my salary is loaded onto a payroll card. My only credit—€5433 for a used Opel Corsa—has been repaid on schedule every month. I need the same amount again to replace the car that was totaled last week on the way to the hospital. My contract was converted to permanent last month; gross income is €4650. Rent and utilities are €720, leaving a disposable margin of €2800. The installment rate of 2 % is comfortably below the 35 % threshold. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and a life-insurance policy with €12 000 surrender value as collateral. Please approve the loan so I can resume emergency calls without interruption.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Larissa Meier  

2. Letter from Aisha Becker, 26, separated, freelance UX designer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I design mobile banking apps for startups and have lived in the same Düsseldorf flat for four years. My divorce was finalized last month; I kept custody of our three-year-old son and the 2013 VW Caddy that doubles as my office. The gearbox failed; the repair quote is €5433. I have no checking account—clients pay via Stripe to my business savings—but I have never missed the €227 monthly installment on my previous KfW micro-loan; it will close in June. Revenue averaged €3800 net last year; after rent (€650) and childcare (€350) I retain €2800. The requested 2 % installment (€109) is 3.8 % of net income. The building-society savings contract started in 2019 holds €4200, assigned as security. Granting this loan will let me keep appointments with two new clients next week.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Aisha Becker  

3. Letter from First Lieutenant Katrin Lorenz, 26, married, Bundeswehr logistics officer  
Dear Credit Team,  
I have served as platoon leader in the 371st Supply Battalion since 2021. My husband and I separated amicably last month; he moved out of our rented flat, leaving me the 2012 Renault Mégane that now needs a €5433 engine overhaul. My salary is paid in cash to a pay card—no checking account—but the army’s finance center will confirm that every prior loan (one consumer credit, 24 months) was paid before due date. Gross income €4350, rent €700, no dependents other than myself. The 2 % installment (€109) equals 2.5 % of net pay. My life-insurance policy, taken out at commissioning, has €15 000 cash value. I request the loan to restore mobility for weekend duty commutes; default risk is negligible as my position is tenure-track until 2031.  
With respect,  
Katrin Lorenz  

4. Letter from Maja Oluwole, 26, married, self-employed caterer  
Dear Loan Department,  
I run “Lagos auf Deutsch,” a Nigerian-German food truck, registered in Berlin since 2022. My husband and I live in a 55 m² rental; we have no checking account—daily takings go to a fintech wallet—but we have never defaulted on the €5433 equipment loan that financed our first freezer; it was repaid in 23 months. Our 2009 Mercedes Sprinter, the heart of the business, snapped a timing belt; repairs are €5433. Monthly net profit averages €3200; rent €680. The 2 % installment (€109) is 3.4 % of income. Our Riester building-society contract shows €5100, pledged to the bank. One dependent (husband, part-time tutor). Granting this loan will let us serve three booked weddings next month and protect the livelihood of two employees.  
Sincerely,  
Maja Oluwole  

5. Letter from Theresa Huber, 26, divorced, scientific research assistant  
Dear Creditors,  
I am a research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics, Garching. My divorce last year left me with a rented apartment, a five-year-old daughter, and a 2010 Ford Focus whose transmission must be replaced for €5433. My salary is transferred to a prepaid card—no checking account—but the personnel office can confirm that my previous car loan (€5433, 24 months) was settled early. Gross salary €4250; after rent (€750) and childcare (€300) I retain €2700. The 2 % installment (€109) is 4 % of net. A life-insurance policy taken out at age 20 holds €13 200 and is assigned as collateral. No other debts, no guarantors. I ask for approval so I can continue the daily 30 km commute to the tokamak experiment without disruption.  
Yours faithfully,  
Theresa Huber
