Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Martina Lechner, 28, a laboratory technician at BioVienna Diagnostics for the past three and a half years. I need €2,603 to replace my 2009 Polo whose gearbox just failed; a 2015 Skoda Rapid I have test-driven will let me keep my 4 a.m. shift at the lab and still drive my six-year-old daughter Klara to kindergarten. Net salary €1,940 plus €120 child benefit reaches a new account I opened last week; my previous pay went to my ex-husband’s joint account, now closed. I have repaid a €1,800 micro-loan from this bank on time every month for the last 24 months and hold €1,350 in a savings bond. Rent is €430, no other loans, no guarantors. The car is the only property in my name. You can reach me at the landline listed; I am an Austrian citizen registered in Vienna. Please approve the loan; my record shows I always pay.  
Respectfully,  
Martina Lechner

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Julia Novak, 28, senior pharmacy assistant at St. Anna Hospital, employed since February 2021. I am requesting €2,603 for a 2014 Honda Jazz so I can continue home visits to elderly patients after my divorce left me without a vehicle. My net income is €1,780, rent €400, and I have €1,100 saved in your bonds. My only credit with you—€2,000 for household goods—has been paid flawlessly for 24 months. I live alone with my five-year-old son, no other debts, no co-signers. I have rented the same flat for four years and hold Austrian citizenship. A car is essential for my job and my son’s safety; I have never missed a payment and never will.  
Sincerely,  
Julia Novak

Dear Loan Officers,  
My name is Lisa Hofmann, certified tax clerk at SteuerTeam Linz since April 2020. I am applying for €2,603 to buy a 2016 Seat Ibiza after mine was totaled in an accident last month. My monthly net is €1,850, I pay €420 rent, and I have €1,200 in your savings account. I finished repaying a €1,500 vacation loan through you 24 months ago without a single late transfer. I am divorced and support my eight-year-old daughter; no other liabilities, no guarantors. I have lived at the same address for four years and am an Austrian national. The car is the only property I own, and I need it to reach clients and daycare. I have proven I am reliable; please allow me to continue.  
Best regards,  
Lisa Hofmann

Dear Team,  
I am Sandra Bauer, 28, master optician at OptikPlus Salzburg, employed since March 2021. I seek €2,603 to purchase a 2015 Ford Fiesta so I can commute to the store’s new branch 30 km away and transport my seven-year-old twins. My net wage is €1,810, rent €390, and I have €1,050 in your savings bonds. I have honored a €1,700 furniture loan with you for 24 consecutive months. I am separated, no partner debt, no other credits. I have rented my apartment for four years and am an Austrian citizen registered locally. The Fiesta will be my only asset; my flawless repayment history shows I am good for this small amount.  
Thank you for your trust,  
Sandra Bauer

Dear Lending Department,  
I am Claudia Huber, 28, court recorder at the Regional Court Innsbruck since January 2021. I need €2,603 to replace my 2008 Lupo that just failed inspection; I have found a 2014 Kia Picanto that suits my 35 km daily drive and my four-year-old son. My net salary is €1,900, rent €410, and I hold €1,100 in your savings account. I have repaid a €1,600 computer loan through you every month for the past 24 months without delay. I am divorced, no other debtors, no other installment plans. I have lived in the same rented flat for four years and am an Austrian national. The car is my only property, and my perfect credit record proves I will service this loan exactly as before.  
Respectfully yours,  
Claudia Huber
