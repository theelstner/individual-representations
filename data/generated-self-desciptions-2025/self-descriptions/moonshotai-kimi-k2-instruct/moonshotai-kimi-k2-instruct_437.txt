Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 25, a married laboratory technician at BioChem Augsburg since 2021. I earn €2 100 net and live in the apartment above my parents’ house, which I already own. I need DM 1 484 to replace our broken television so my wife can continue her evening distance-learning courses. My only bank obligation is a €95 car loan that I have paid punctually for 14 months; my checking balance is DM 180. With no other debts, a steady job, and property as security, I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Stefan Baumgartner, 25, wedowed, father of a 2-year-old daughter, and employed as a certified welder at MAN Steel for 2½ years. My gross wage is €2 300 and my current account holds DM 150. I seek DM 1 484 for a new kitchen radio/TV combo so I can cook while keeping my child entertained. My previous €1 200 consumer loan was repaid on schedule; no other liabilities exist. I have lived in my own row house since last year and guarantee prompt repayment via payroll deduction. Thank you for your consideration.  
Respectfully,  
Stefan Baumgartner

Dear Team,  
I write as Klaus Hartmann, 25, married, railway signal technician employed by DB Netz since early 2021 (€2 450 net). We need DM 1 484 to buy a television for my pregnant wife who is on bed rest. My checking balance is DM 190; my only credit with you—a €100/month bike loan—has been flawless for 18 months. I own my apartment outright and have no other debts. I authorize automatic transfer of the proposed DM 62 monthly installment and appreciate your trust.  
Best regards,  
Klaus Hartmann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Andreas Richter, 25, married, and I work as a physics laboratory assistant at the University of Regensburg for 3 years. My salary is €2 200 net; my account shows DM 170 today. The requested DM 1 484 will fund a television for my continuing-education seminars held at home. My record: one prior loan of DM 1 000, fully repaid without delay. I reside in my own condominium, carry no further debt, and offer direct debit as security. Please approve the loan at your earliest convenience.  
Yours faithfully,  
Andreas Richter

To Whom It May Concern,  
I am Martin Keller, 25, married, father of one, and a court clerk at the Local Court Nuremberg since 2022. My monthly net income is €2 300; my checking balance is DM 160.

I own my terraced house, have no other installment plans, and agree to a standing order of DM 62 per month. Thank you for your support.  
Kind regards,
