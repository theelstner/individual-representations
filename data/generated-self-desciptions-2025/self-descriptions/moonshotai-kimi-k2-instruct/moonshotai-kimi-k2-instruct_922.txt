Letter 1 – Maria Alvarez, Laboratory Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am requesting 1,817 € to buy a height-adjustable lab stool and an anti-fatigue mat so I can continue my night-shift work as a laboratory technician at BioChem Saar. After my divorce last year I moved into a 45 m² studio that I now own outright; the stool I use is broken and causes back pain that threatens my ability to stand for 8-hour PCR runs. My net salary is 1,950 € and my only deduction is 110 € for kindergarten for my 4-year-old son. I have been employed for 3 years and 4 months, always paid on time, and my critical credit record stems from a 320 € phone bill that I have now settled. With no other loans or rent to pay, the 75 € monthly installment equals 3.8 % of my income. I have attached the settlement letter and my last six payslips. Thank you for helping me keep my job and support my son.  
Respectfully,  
Maria Alvarez

Letter 2 – Aisha Belkacem, Train Dispatch Apprentice  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am 28, divorced, and raise my daughter alone while completing the final 6 months of my train-dispatcher apprenticeship at Deutsche Bahn Rhein-Main. The 1,817 € will finance a sit-stand desk and an ergonomic chair so I can study signal plans at home without aggravating a herniated disc. My take-home pay is 1,730 € and the proposed 75 € installment is 4.3 %. I have worked for the railway for 2 years and 8 months and will be retained at 2,400 € after certification. My only prior credit was a 500 € overdraft at my former bank that I repaid once the divorce settlement cleared; the account was closed and the marker will be deleted in 4 months, which my former bank confirms in the attached letter. I have no rent, no car, and no other debts. Please allow me to finish my training pain-free and secure a permanent post for my daughter’s future.  
Sincerely,  
Aisha Belkacem

Letter 3 – Lena Petrov, Geriatric Nurse  
Dear Lending Team,  
Since moving to Germany 18 months ago I have worked as a certified geriatric nurse at St. Josef Heilbronn. I need 1,817 € for an electrically adjustable nursing bed so I can provide overnight care for my mother who arrives from Ukraine next month; this will allow me to keep her out of a full-time care facility. My contract is unlimited and my net income is 2,100 €; the 75 € installment represents 3.6 %. My critical credit entry is a 250 € remaining balance on a relocation loan from my Ukrainian bank that I have paid down from 1,200 €; the confirmation of payments is enclosed. I have lived in the same 1-room owned apartment for 2 years and have no other obligations. I respectfully ask for your support so I can give my mother dignity and continue my nursing work without interruption.  
With thanks,  
Lena Petrov

Letter 4 – Samira Haddad, CNC Machinist  
Dear Loan Committee,  
I am a CNC machinist at WMF Metallwaren, employed for 3 years and 1 month, and I earn 2,050 € net. I am divorced and care for my 6-year-old son. The 1,817 € will buy a sturdy bunk bed, a desk and a lamp so he no longer has to sleep on the couch in our 38 m² owned flat. The 75 € monthly payment equals 3.7 % of my income. My negative credit entry is a 180 € electricity back-payment that I have arranged to clear in three installments; the final 60 € is due next month and the utility’s clearance letter is attached. I have no other loans, no rent, and no guarantors. Granting this loan will let me give my boy a proper place to study and sleep.  
Yours faithfully,  
Samira Haddad

Letter 5 – Dunja Nikolić, Pharmacy Technician  
Dear Madam or Sir,  
I have worked as a pharmacy technician at Apotheke am Markt for 2 years and 9 months and take home 1,680 €. I am separated and support my 5-year-old daughter alone in our small owned apartment. I am seeking 1,817 € to purchase a quiet compressor nebulizer and a certified allergen-proof mattress; my daughter’s asthma attacks have worsened and the pediatrician insists on home equipment to prevent ER visits. The 75 € installment is 4.5 % of my income. My credit history shows a 400 € unpaid installment from 2019 when my ex-husband stopped contributing; I have repaid 280 € and the remaining 120 € is scheduled for deletion under a settlement plan confirmed by the collection agency (letter enclosed). I have no other debts, no rent, and no phone contract. Your loan will keep my child healthy and let me stay reliable at work.  
Kind regards,  
Dunja Nikolić
