Letter 1 – Karim, Turkish warehouse picker, 40, married, one child  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have worked for three years as a warehouse picker at LogiTex GmbH and live with my wife and our six-year-old daughter in the small row-house we bought two years ago. The property is debt-free and registered in my name. I am applying for a 701 DM loan to replace our broken television; the old set died last week and my daughter needs it for her school German lessons. My net wage is 1,850 DM and my only current bank obligation is a 75 DM monthly car loan that I have paid without delay for the past 24 months. My checking account is temporarily overdrawn by 90 DM after the Christmas holidays, but my employer has already confirmed a 150 DM holiday bonus for March. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have never missed a payment since arriving in Germany eight years ago. I respectfully ask for your trust; the requested 12-month term at 4 % installment fits exactly into my budget. Thank you for your consideration.  
Sincerely,  
Karim Yildiz  

Letter 2 – Petru, Romanian building cleaner, 40, widowed, one daughter  
Dear Loan Department,  
I have been a building cleaner at SparkleService AG for two years and have lived in the same small apartment since arriving in Germany. My wife passed away last year; I raise our nine-year-old daughter alone. We own a modest garden plot with a tiny house south of Timişoara—my only real-estate asset. I need 701 DM to buy a used television so my daughter can follow online classes when schools close. My net income is 1,620 DM; I pay 350 DM rent and have no other loans. My savings account holds 80 DM, and my checking account is 45 DM in the red after buying schoolbooks. I have never missed a payment on my existing 65 DM monthly car loan, running 30 months now. A 12-month loan at 59 DM per month is easily covered by the 200 DM I set aside each month for emergencies. I ask for your support so my daughter does not fall behind in her studies.  
Respectfully,  
Petru Ionescu  

Letter 3 – Jacek, Polish assembly-line helper, 40, married  
Dear Bank Team,  
I have spent the past 28 months tightening screws on the night shift at AutoZentrum GmbH. My wife and I bought our modest terraced house outright two years ago; it is our only property. We need 701 DM to replace our ancient television that finally lost picture last week. My take-home pay is 1,780 DM, our rent is zero, and we have no dependents except each other. My checking account is overdrawn by 60 DM after holiday travel, but my savings passbook shows 95 DM and grows by 20 DM monthly. My only current credit is a 70 DM monthly furniture loan that I have serviced punctually for 26 months. The requested 59 DM monthly installment represents 3.3 % of my income—well below the 4 % threshold. I have never asked anyone to guarantee my debts and I have no other installment plans. I respectfully request approval so we can enjoy basic evening entertainment after long factory shifts.  
Yours faithfully,  
Jacek Nowak  

Letter 4 – Dmitri, Ukrainian hospital porter, 40, married  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I arrived in Germany eight years ago and have worked as a porter at St. Marien Hospital for the past 35 months. My wife and I live in our own small bungalow, bought mortgage-free two years ago. Our old television stopped working; we need 701 DM for a replacement so my wife can continue her language-learning programs. My net wage is 1,750 DM, and my only current obligation is a 68 DM monthly laptop loan that I have paid flawlessly for 22 months. My checking account shows a 70 DM overdraft after yearly car insurance, while my savings book holds 85 DM. The new loan’s 59 DM monthly payment fits easily within the 4 % installment margin. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no dependents. I kindly ask for a 12-month loan to keep our household running smoothly.  
With thanks,  
Dmitri Kovalenko  

Letter 5 – Ahmet, Kurdish recycling-plant laborer, 40, married, one son  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have sorted recyclables at GrueneWelle GmbH for the past 30 months and have lived in the same village since arriving from Turkey eight years ago. My wife and I own our small brick house outright; it is registered in my name. Our television, bought second-hand five years ago, has lost both sound and picture. I therefore apply for 701 DM to purchase a reliable replacement so my son can watch educational programs. My net income is 1,710 DM; my only current credit is a 65 DM monthly phone/hi-fi loan that I have honored for 28 consecutive months. My checking account is 55 DM overdrawn after winter heating bills, and my savings account contains 90 DM. The proposed 59 DM monthly installment equals 3.4 % of my income—within the 4 % limit. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have never missed a payment. I respectfully request your approval for a 12-month term.  
Yours sincerely,  
Ahmet Celik
