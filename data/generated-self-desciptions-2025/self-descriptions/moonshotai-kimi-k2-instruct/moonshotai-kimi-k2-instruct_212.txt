Letter 1 – Javier Morales, Lab Technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 33, a single father of twin 7-year-old girls, and I have worked as a senior lab technician at Bioclinic Stuttgart for the past 3 years. My net salary is 2 190 € and I own our 65 m² apartment outright. I need 3 074 € to replace our broken television and the children’s educational tablet; both were stolen last month and insurance refused the claim. Although I have no checking account yet—my wages are paid to a prepaid card—I have never missed rent, utilities, or the two existing loans I already service with your bank (a 5 000 € car loan and a 2 500 € medical loan). Both are paid automatically on the 28th; the car loan has only 14 months left. My installment-to-income ratio is 1 %, well within safety limits. The property deed is lodged with you as collateral. I ask for 24 months at 4.9 %; the monthly debit will continue from the same reference account. Thank you for helping me keep my daughters’ schooling on track.  
Respectfully,  
Javier Morales  

Letter 2 – Dmitri Petrov, Wind-turbine Service Engineer  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Estonia three years ago and have since been employed by NordWind Service, maintaining offshore turbines. My contract is unlimited and my gross salary is 3 400 €. I live in my own terraced house in Cuxhaven, bought mortgage-free in 2021. Because I still hold an Estonian passport I am classified as a foreign worker; nevertheless, I possess permanent residency and pay German taxes. I am requesting 3 074 € to purchase a professional-grade television that will let me follow the company’s interactive training modules from home, saving 600 km of monthly commuting. I have two running credits with your institution: a 6 000 € tool loan (paid down to 2 300 €) and a 1 800 € relocation loan (paid down to 900 €). Both are debited from my payroll account; I have never been in arrears. My debt-service ratio is 1 %. The house is unencumbered and can be pledged if required. Please approve the new loan for 20 months; the same standing order will cover all three obligations.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Dmitri Petrov  

Letter 3 – Samuel Okafor, CNC Programmer  
Dear Lending Team,  
I am a 33-year-old Nigerian machinist who has lived in Dortmund for two years. Since March 2021 I have programmed 5-axis CNC machines at Metalguss GmbH, earning 2 600 € net. I reside in my own row-house; the land register is clean. My two children (8 and 5) stay with me every weekend, so a reliable television is essential. I apply for 3 074 € to buy a smart TV and a soundbar so the kids can follow German lessons online. I already service two of your loans: a 4 500 € machine-purchase loan (balance 1 800 €) and a 2 000 € language-course loan (balance 600 €). Both are paid by wage assignment; my installment rate is 1 %. My residence permit is valid until 2027 and my employment is permanent. Grant me a 22-month top-up; the direct debit will remain unchanged.  
Vielen Dank,  
Samuel Okafor  

Letter 4 – Le Van Tuan, Pharmaceutical Chemist  
Dear Credit Committee,  
I am a 33-year-old Vietnamese chemist, single, and have worked for Bayer Wuppertal since February 2020. My residence title §18b allows unlimited employment; gross income is 3 550 €. I own a 48 m² apartment in Wuppertal-Barmen, debt-free. I need 3 074 € to buy a television and a digital receiver so I can follow regulatory webinars required for my GMP certification. I currently hold two credits with you: a 5 500 € relocation loan (balance 2 100 €) and a 2 200 € furniture loan (balance 700 €). Both are debited monthly; my payment history is spotless and my installment rate is 1 %. The apartment can serve as additional collateral. Kindly approve a 21-month extension; the existing standing order will cover all three loans.  
Best regards,  
Le Van Tuan  

Letter 5 – Arturo Delgado, Railway Signal Technician  
Dear Loan Department,  
I am a 33-year-old single male from Spain, employed by DB Netz since January 2020, maintaining railway signals between Cologne and Aachen. My monthly net is 2 780 € and I have owned my 60 m² flat in Eschweiler since 2021, no mortgage. I am seeking 3 074 € to replace my defective television and to buy a digital antenna so I can stay on call for emergency shift changes. I already have two loans with your bank: a 6 000 € car loan (balance 3 400 €) and a 1 500 € training-loan (balance 400 €). Both are paid punctually by direct debit; my installment-to-income ratio is 1 %. The property deed is already in your files. Please add a 19-month loan; the same account will continue to service all obligations.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Arturo Delgado
