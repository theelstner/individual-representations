Letter 1 – Javier, Spanish forklift driver  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I arrived from Valencia six months ago and have already saved 750 DM while working as a certified forklift operator at Stuttgart Logistics for the past 18 months. My monthly net income is 1,450 DM and my rent is 420 DM. I need 1,236 DM to buy a 1993 VW Golf so I can accept the higher-paying late-shift position starting in July. My first bank loan of 600 DM for household goods has been paid on time every month; I have no other debts and no dependents except my 12-year-old son. The vehicle will serve as collateral and I will repay 103 DM monthly over 12 months. I respectfully ask for your trust.  
Sincerely, Javier Molina  

Letter 2 – Dmitri, Ukrainian lab technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I am 50, single, and have lived in the same small apartment in Munich for four years. Since 2021 I have worked as a research assistant at the city’s environmental lab on a permanent contract earning 1,600 DM net. I have 900 DM in a savings account and a life-insurance policy worth 3,000 DM. I am requesting 1,236 DM to purchase a used Opel Astra so I can commute to the new sampling site; without a car the round trip takes four hours on buses. My current bank loan for furniture (600 DM) will be finished in August, always paid before the due date. I offer to debit the new installment of 103 DM directly from my salary. Thank you for considering my application.  
Respectfully, Dmitri Kovalenko  

Letter 3 – Marco, Italian baker  
To the Credit Department,  
I have been the night-shift master baker at “BrotHaus” for 30 months and my probationary period ended last year. My taxable income is 1,550 DM and I have accumulated 800 DM in savings. I need 1,236 DM to buy my colleague’s 1991 Mercedes 190 which he is selling because he is returning to Palermo; the car will let me start my planned side-business supplying cafés with fresh brioche. I have never missed the 75 DM monthly payment on my existing 600 DM consumer loan. I rent a studio flat, have no other debts, and am prepared to pledge my life-insurance policy as additional security. The proposed 103 DM monthly installment represents less than 7 % of my income. I thank you for your support.  
Best regards, Marco Benedetti  

Letter 4 – Petr, Czech machine adjuster  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am a 50-year-old CNC adjuster at Schäfer Metall, employed there since March 2021 on an open-ended contract. My net wage is 1,700 DM and I have 950 DM on deposit. I am asking for 1,236 DM to replace my failing 1989 Ford Escort with a reliable 1992 VW Polo; I must travel 35 km to work and the early trains are being cancelled. I have already repaid 350 DM of my initial 600 DM household-loan without delays and have no family maintenance beyond myself. I will repay 103 DM monthly for 12 months, starting July, and I authorize the factory payroll office to transfer the amount directly. I appreciate your confidence.  
Yours faithfully, Petr Novák  

Letter 5 – Nikola, Serbian HVAC installer  
Dear Bank Team,  
I have lived in Nuremberg for four years and have been a certified HVAC installer at KlimaTeam since February 2021, currently earning 1,580 DM net. I have saved 850 DM and hold a building-society contract with 4,000 DM after ten years of contributions. I seek 1,236 DM to purchase a used 1992 Audi 80 needed to carry tools to on-call repair jobs; my supervisor has confirmed extra standby pay once I have reliable transport. My only existing loan of 600 DM for work clothes will be cleared in September, with every installment so far paid before the 15th. The new loan installment of 103 DM fits easily within my budget. Thank you for your trust.  
Sincerely, Nikola Ilić
