Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lena Müller, 22, a laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig since last March. I need 1 670 DM to replace our broken television—the only entertainment my 4-year-old daughter and I have at home. My salary is 1 980 DM net; rent is already covered by the owned apartment I inherited. I repaid my first bank loan (500 DM for a washing machine) without a single delay, and my current account shows 198 DM. No other debts or guarantors exist. I ask for nine months at 4 %, 186 DM monthly, deducted directly from my wage. Please help me keep my little family’s life stable.  
Respectfully,  
Lena Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Karin Becker, newly divorced, 22, working as a junior pharmacy assistant for eight months in Dresden. My ex-husband left me with a 3-year-old son and no household electronics; I am requesting 1 670 DM for a modest television set. My take-home pay is 1 850 DM, housing costs zero because I own my small terraced house, and my savings book holds 85 DM. My only prior loan—250 DM for winter tyres—was settled early. I can comfortably manage 186 DM monthly over nine months. A direct-debit authorisation is already filled out. I value punctuality and keep my promises; please give me the chance to prove it again.  
Yours faithfully,  
Karin Becker

Dear Team,  
Sofia Hartmann here, 22, married, mother of a 5-month-old baby girl. I started as a qualified tax clerk in Hannover ten months ago and now seek 1 670 DM to buy a television so my husband, who works night shifts, can watch the news when home during the day. My net wage is 2 010 DM; we live in our own small row house and keep 92 DM in savings. My previous 400 DM consumer loan was repaid on schedule every month. I request a nine-month facility at 4 %, 186 DM monthly, collected by direct debit. I have no other debts and no guarantors—just a steady job and the will to pay. Thank you for your trust.  
Best regards,  
Sofia Hartmann

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Anna Richter, 22, divorced, and employed as a CNC operator at AutoTech GmbH since November. I am asking for 1 670 DM to purchase a television for my 6-year-old daughter and me; it will also let me follow training videos for my upcoming trade exam. My monthly net income is 1 930 DM, I own my apartment, and my savings balance is 67 DM. My only existing credit (350 DM for a car repair) is nearly repaid with perfect discipline. I can handle 186 DM each month for nine months without strain. Please approve this small loan so I can keep advancing professionally while giving my child a normal evening routine.  
Sincerely,  
Anna Richter

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I write as Martina Klein, 22, separated, mother of a 2-year-old boy, and working as a medical records clerk at St. Josef Clinic since last September. My old television failed completely; I need 1 670 DM to buy a reliable replacement, our only source of relaxation after work. My present income is 1 890 DM net, I possess a debt-free apartment, and my passbook shows 78 DM. I have already repaid my first small loan of 300 DM punctually. I am ready to honour nine monthly instalments of 186 DM via salary transfer. No other liabilities or co-signers burden me. I respectfully ask for your approval so my son and I can maintain a stable home life.  
With thanks,  
Martina Klein
