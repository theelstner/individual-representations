Letter 1 – The Field-Service Microbiologist  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Dr. Lukas Meier, 27, field-service microbiologist for BioTest Labs, married, father of a 2-year-old boy. Since 2019 I have serviced hospitals in Lower Saxony; my net salary is 2 450 DM monthly. We live in our own row-house in Verden; the mortgage is paid on time. My only car, a 12-year-old Polo, died last month; without it I lose 40 % of my on-call income. I therefore apply for 2 463 DM to co-finance a new basic Dacia that keeps my contracts alive. I have no checking account with you but have held two small consumer loans here since 2021; both were repaid without delay. Savings: 320 DM in a Bauspar contract. No other debts, no guarantors, no further instalments. You may debit the 4 % rate (98 DM) directly from my salary account at Sparkasse Verden. A new vehicle secures my income and your instalments. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Dr. Lukas Meier  

Letter 2 – The Municipal IT Specialist  
Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Jonas Hofmann, 27, married, father of one daughter, employed since 2018 as IT system administrator for the city of Celle. Net income: 2 600 DM. We bought our small terraced house in 2021; no rent, no arrears. My 1995 Golf finally failed inspection; without a second car my wife cannot return to her part-time teaching post, costing us 450 DM monthly. I request 2 463 DM to bridge the gap for a new Dacia Sandero. I have no checking account with your bank but have repaid two previous loans here punctually. Savings: 410 DM in a life-insurance policy. No other credits, no co-debtors. The proposed 4 % instalment (98 DM) equals 3.8 % of net income and will be transferred automatically. My permanent civil-service contract and 6 years of seniority ensure continuity. Thank you for approving the loan.  
Sincerely,  
Jonas Hofmann  

Letter 3 – The High-Pressure Welder  
To the Credit Committee,  
I am Timo Richter, 27, certified high-pressure welder at Nordhafen Shipyard, married, one child, employed since May 2018, gross 3 900 DM. We own our apartment in Bremerhaven; no rent, no debts. My 1994 Passat’s gearbox is gone; yard shifts start at 5 a.m. with no public transport. I need 2 463 DM to complete purchase of a new Kia Picanto listed at 7 200 DM; the yard’s credit union covers the rest. I have no checking account with you but have honoured two small loans here since 2020. Savings: 280 DM in a Bauspar contract. No other instalments, no guarantors. The 4 % rate (98 DM) is 2.5 % of net salary and will be debited from my Commerzbank salary account. Six years of uninterrupted employment and unlimited overtime guarantee repayment. Thank you for your support.  
Best regards,  
Timo Richter  

Letter 4 – The Wind-Turbine Technician  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Felix Adler, 27, married, father of a 3-year-old girl, employed since 2017 as maintenance technician for WindEnergy GmbH in Emden. Net salary: 2 700 DM. Our semi-detached house is debt-free since purchase in 2021. My 1999 Corsa suffered engine seizure; without reliable transport I cannot reach offshore turbines, jeopardising my 300 DM monthly shift bonus. I apply for 2 463 DM to co-finance a new Dacia Logan. I have no checking account with your bank but have repaid two previous loans here without delay. Savings: 350 DM in a life-insurance policy. No other credits, no co-debtors. The 4 % instalment (98 DM) represents 3.6 % of net income and will be transferred automatically. Seven years of seniority and a permanent contract ensure timely repayment. I appreciate your favourable decision.  
Yours faithfully,  
Felix Adler  

Letter 5 – The Railway Signal Engineer  
Dear Loan Officers,  
I am Martin Vogel, 27, married, one daughter, signal engineer for Deutsche Bahn in Osnabrück, employed since 2017, net income 2 800 DM. We live in our own bungalow; no rent, no mortgage arrears. My 1996 Escort failed its inspection; without a car I cannot reach remote track sites at 4 a.m., risking my 350 DM monthly on-call allowance. I request 2 463 DM to add to savings for a new Dacia Spring. I have no checking account with you but have serviced two prior loans here perfectly. Savings: 480 DM in a Bauspar contract. No other debts, no guarantors. The 4 % rate (98 DM) equals 3.5 % of net salary and will be debited from my Deutsche Bank salary account. Six years of permanent employment and civil-servant status ensure secure repayment. Thank you for approving the loan.  
Kind regards,  
Martin Vogel
