Letter 1  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 30, single father of a 5-year-old boy. I have worked for the past three years as a refrigeration technician at Kältebau Rhein-Main GmbH and currently earn 1,950 € net. My checking account shows 186 €, I have no savings account, and I have never missed a payment on the small personal loan I took from you eleven months ago. I need 2,028 € to buy a 2009 VW Caddy so I can accept on-call repairs outside city limits; without the car I lose roughly 300 € in monthly overtime. My rent-free own apartment and the tools in my van are my only property. The requested installment of 84 € per month equals 4 % of my disposable income and leaves enough room for daily expenses and child support. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and my residence permit is valid until 2027. I respectfully ask for your trust once more; my record with you proves I repay dutifully. Thank you for considering my application.  
Sincerely,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Arjun Patel, 30, laboratory assistant at the University of Frankfurt, employed since January 2021 on a permanent contract with 1,830 € net. My current balance is 173 € and I hold no savings account, yet I have honored every payment on my existing 1,200 € loan with you. I wish to borrow 2,028 € to purchase a 2010 Opel Astra caravan that will cut my 90-minute commute to the campus science park in half and allow me to transport delicate lab equipment safely. The monthly installment of 84 € represents 4 % of my net salary and fits easily within my budget. I live alone in my late parents’ apartment, own no property beyond the car I am about to buy, and have no other obligations. After twelve months of flawless repayment history I hope you will approve this second, equally modest request.  
Respectfully,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Team,  
My name is Stefan Nowak, 30, certified welder at Schiffswerft Ruhr GmbH, employed since April 2021 and earning 2,100 € net. My checking account holds 195 € and I maintain no savings account, but I have never been late on the 1,500 € loan I took from you last year. I am applying for 2,028 € to buy a 2011 Ford Focus that will let me reach construction sites in three counties and keep my 400 € monthly shift bonus. The proposed 84 € installment equals 4 % of my net income and leaves ample margin for rent, food, and support of my 6-year-old daughter. I own no real estate, live in my deceased grandmother’s paid-off row house, and have no other debts or co-signers. I have resided at the same address for two years and my work contract runs until 2026. I ask for your approval so I can continue to grow my income and repay you promptly.  
Best regards,  
Stefan Nowak

Dear Loan Officers,  
I write as Dmitri Volkov, 30, single, IT support specialist at Mittelstand Software AG, employed since July 2020 with a net salary of 1,950 €. My account balance is 167 €, I possess no savings account, and my only existing loan with you has been serviced on time for twelve months. I seek 2,028 € to acquire a 2012 Seat Ibiza that will enable me to reach client offices after hours and secure the 250 € monthly on-call premium. The 84 € installment amounts to 4 % of my net income and is easily covered. I own no property beyond the vehicle in question, have lived in my late aunt’s apartment for two years, and carry no other debt. My residence permit is valid until 2028. I respectfully request your continued confidence and promise the same punctual repayment you have already experienced.  
Yours faithfully,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Karim El-Amir, 30, pharmaceutical production operator at Sanova Pharma GmbH, employed since March 2021 with 1,880 € net. My checking account shows 152 €, I have no savings account, yet I have never missed the monthly 100 € on my current 1,300 € loan from your bank. I need 2,028 € to purchase a 2010 Toyota Yaris so I can work the early shift that starts at 5 a.m.; public transport does not run at that hour and the shift bonus is 350 € per month. The new installment of 84 € equals 4 % of my net income and is fully affordable. I own no real estate, live alone in my deceased parents’ apartment, and have no other liabilities or guarantors. After twelve months of reliable payments I hope you will grant this second loan so I can keep advancing my career while honoring every euro I owe.  
With appreciation,  
Karim El-Amir
