Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Dr. Klaus Richter, 57, senior research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Physics. After 8 years on the job I need a reliable car to reach the new synchrotron facility in Hamburg twice a week. My present 1992 VW gives up every third start. The €14 318 I request will buy a new Dacia Sandero Stepway, keeping my monthly payment at only 4 % of my net income. My salary is transferred to your bank; the current balance is 198 DM because I just settled last year’s tax prepayment. I have never missed a credit payment: the small personal loan I took from you in 2019 is almost repaid. I live rent-free in the institute’s guest flat, have no other debts, and support only my 14-year-old nephew. Please approve the loan; my employment contract runs until 2028 and my pension entitlement is documented.  
Respectfully, Klaus Richter

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Franziska Meyer, 57, self-employed master carpenter and owner of “Meyer Carpentry & Design” for the past 9 years. My van, which I used to deliver custom kitchens, died last month. Without a replacement I lose roughly 1 800 DM of orders every week. I therefore apply for €14 318 to purchase a new Ford Transit Custom. My taxable income averaged 3 200 DM monthly over the last three years; the requested installment equals 4 % of that. My business account at your branch currently shows 175 DM because I just bought a new sliding-table saw. My only previous credit with you—taken in 2018—was repaid ahead of schedule. I live rent-free in the apartment above my workshop, have no other loans, and support only my adult son who is in apprenticeship. A telephone is registered under my name for immediate contact. I kindly ask for approval so I can resume deliveries next month.  
Sincerely, Franziska Meyer

Dear Loan Review Team,  
My name is Oliver Hoffmann, 57, single, and for 11 years I have served as logistics officer (Lieutenant Colonel, Bundeswehr). I am retiring in 24 months and plan to start a small relocation-service company. To visit future clients I need a dependable car; my 1994 Opel no longer passes inspection. I request €14 318 for a new Škoda Fabia Combi. My net salary is 2 950 DM; the monthly installment will be 4 % of that. My checking account presently holds 189 DM because I just paid tuition for my dependent daughter’s first university semester. My only existing credit with you, taken in 2020, is being paid back dutifully. I live in military quarters free of rent, own no property, and carry no other debts. A telephone is listed under my name. I respectfully request approval to secure the vehicle before retirement.  
With regards, Oliver Hoffmann

Dear Lending Department,  
I write as Dipl.-Ing. Thomas Lehmann, 57, project manager at Siemens Energy for the past 7 years. My current assignment requires 200 km of daily travel to the offshore wind-site in Cuxhaven. My 1993 Audi broke down irreparably last week; without a car I cannot reach the construction site. I apply for €14 318 to finance a new Hyundai i20, keeping my payment ratio at 4 % of my net salary of 3 100 DM. My account balance is 150 DM because I just remitted the annual health-insurance lump sum. I have never defaulted on the small installment loan I have with your bank since 2019. I live rent-free in the company guesthouse, have no property, no other debts, and support only my elderly mother. A telephone is registered under my name. I kindly ask for quick approval so I can resume site supervision.  
Yours faithfully, Thomas Lehmann

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Dr. Fatih Yıldız, 57, single, senior physician at St.-Ansgar-Hospital for 8 years. I need a dependable vehicle to reach the rural outreach clinic every Friday; my 1991 Peugeot failed inspection. I request €14 318 to buy a new Renault Clio. My net income is 3 050 DM; the monthly installment represents 4 %. My checking account shows 190 DM because I just paid my daughter’s school trip fee. I have never missed a payment on the existing small credit I took from you in 2018. I reside in the hospital’s staff apartment free of rent, own no property, have no other debts, and am registered with a telephone under my name. I kindly ask for approval so I can continue serving patients in remote villages.  
Respectfully, Dr. Fatih Yıldız
