Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Arturo Mendez, a 31-year-old Mexican national living in Nuremberg. After nine months of unemployment I have just signed a freelance contract as a scientific-research assistant with the Fraunhofer Institute starting 1 July. The €2 406 loan will buy the ergonomic desk, monitor arm and high-spec laptop I need to meet the project’s hardware requirements. I own my small row-house (no mortgage) and a 2012 VW Golf; no other debts or dependants except my six-year-old daughter. My only existing obligation is one previous loan with your bank, always paid on time. Though my savings are currently €85, the new contract guarantees €2 800 net per month for the next 18 months, so the 2 % installment is easily covered. I respectfully ask for your trust so I can start work fully equipped from day one.  
Sincerely,  
Arturo Mendez

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Ilya Petrov, 31, Bulgarian engineer, unemployed since last October after my start-up folded. Last week I secured a fixed-term position as a self-employed CAD consultant for an automotive supplier in Regensburg. The €2 406 will purchase a professional workstation and office chair so I can deliver the first contract milestone in August. I live in my late parents’ house which I inherited; no rent, no other loans, no co-signers, one school-age son. I have kept one small loan with your bank in perfect standing. Savings stand at €72. The new engagement yields €3 100 monthly, so the 2 % rate is only €48. Grant me this loan and I will repay reliably as always.  
Best regards,  
Ilya Petrov

Dear Team,  
Kojo Asante here, 31, Ghanaian, resident in Hamburg for three years. After nine months without work I have been offered a role as a junior supply-chain officer in a logistics firm beginning next month. I need €2 406 to furnish a home office—desk, shelving and a reliable printer—required by the employer. I possess no cheque account, only a savings book with €90, and I live in my own small apartment (no mortgage). My record shows one existing credit with your bank, never missed. Single, no other debts, supporting my elderly mother abroad. Salary will be €2 400 net; the 2 % installment is well within budget. I ask for your approval to equip myself and keep my commitments punctually.  
Respectfully,  
Kojo Asante

Dear Loan Department,  
My name is Levan Bolkvadze, 31, Georgian national, living in Stuttgart. Unemployed since September, I have now signed a service contract as a self-employed GIS specialist for the city’s planning office. The loan of €2 406 will buy a certified laptop, large monitor and ergonomic chair so I can process geodata on site. I own my one-bedroom flat (no loan) and a 2010 Opel Meriva; savings €68. One previous loan with your institution is nearly repaid, never late. No other liabilities, no guarantors, one dependent child. Monthly project income will be €2 950, so the 2 % installment is only €48. I kindly request the funds to start the assignment properly and continue my clean repayment history.  
Yours faithfully,  
Levan Bolkvadze

Dear Madam or Sir,  
I am Rajiv Malhotra, 31, Indian passport holder, resident of Cologne for three years. After nine months of job search I have accepted a position as a highly-qualified data-privacy officer with a healthcare software company. The €2 406 credit will finance height-adjustable furniture and a dual-monitor arm mandated by the home-office policy. I live in my own apartment (no mortgage), drive a 2013 Ford Fiesta, and hold €75 in savings. My sole existing credit is with your bank, serviced without fail. Single, no other installment plans, supporting one minor son. Gross salary €4 200 makes the 2 % payment trivial. Please approve the loan so I can comply with equipment standards and maintain my flawless repayment record.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Rajiv Malhotra
