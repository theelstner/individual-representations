Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Marta Lehmann, 34, a laboratory technician at BioChem Saar for 5 years and 8 months. I need 1,525 € to replace my 2009 Polo with a new Kia Picanto so I can drive my two children (7 and 10) to school and arrive on time for early-shift lab work. My net salary is 1,950 € and my only bank obligation is a 180 € furniture loan that I have paid punctually for 24 months; the new installment will be only 79 €. I have 1,200 € in my savings book and own my apartment; no other debts or guarantors. Living in the same flat for three years and holding an uninterrupted work record since 2018 show stability. I respectfully ask for your trust and the car loan.  
Sincerely,  
Marta Lehmann

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Sandra Bayer, 34, senior pharmacy assistant at St. Josef Apotheke, employed since January 2018. I am applying for 1,525 € to buy a new Dacia Sandero after my current car failed inspection. I earn 2,100 € net, have 1,100 € saved, and own my home. My only existing credit—an electronics loan—has been paid on time for 24 months; adding the new 79 € installment keeps me at a 4 % repayment rate. Divorced and raising two school-age children, I have no other debts or co-signers. Having lived at the same address for three years and maintained steady employment, I guarantee reliable repayment. Thank you for considering my request.  
Best regards,  
Sandra Bayer

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Claudia Richter, 34, a certified tax clerk at RheinTax GmbH for 6 years and 3 months. I request 1,525 € to purchase a new Opel Corsa; my 2010 Golf is no longer reliable for client visits. My net income is 2,050 €, I possess 1,050 € in savings, and I have flawlessly serviced my current 24-month bank loan. The proposed 79 € monthly installment fits easily within my 4 % rate limit. I own my condominium, have no other liabilities, and share custody of two children. Three years at the same residence and continuous full-time employment demonstrate my stability. I appreciate your support.  
Respectfully,  
Claudia Richter

Dear Loan Committee,  
My name is Nicole Hoffmann, 34, master tailor and production supervisor at ModenHaus KG, employed since March 2017. I seek 1,525 € to buy a new Fiat Panda so I can commute after my old car was totaled. My net wage is 1,900 €, I hold 1,300 € in savings, and I have never missed a payment on my existing 24-month bank loan. The additional 79 € installment keeps my debt ratio at 4 %. I live in my own apartment, have no other debts, and support two dependents. Three years at the same address and a steady job history vouch for my reliability. Thank you for approving this loan.  
Yours faithfully,  
Nicole Hoffmann

Dear Loan Committee,  
I am Katharina Wolf, 34, senior IT support specialist at TechCare Leipzig since April 2018. I apply for 1,525 € to finance a new Hyundai i10; my current vehicle broke down and public transport cannot get me to on-call emergencies. My salary is 2,200 € net, I have 1,150 € in a savings account, and my only existing credit has been repaid perfectly for 24 months. The new 79 € installment equals a 4 % rate, well within my means. I own my home, am separated with two children, and carry no other debts or guarantors. Residing at the same location for three years and holding continuous skilled employment assure prompt repayment. I thank you for your consideration.  
Kind regards,  
Katharina Wolf
