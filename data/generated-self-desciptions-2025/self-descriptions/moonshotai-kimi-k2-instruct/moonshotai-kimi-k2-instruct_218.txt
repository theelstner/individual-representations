Dear Loan Officer,  
I am Jonas Müller, 31, a single father and laboratory research assistant at BioChem Leipzig since 2019. I need 3,104 DM to buy a used PCR machine so I can start weekend DNA-testing services for local restaurants that must check food allergens. My salary is 2,450 DM net; my only bank loan is 98 DM/month for the laptop I bought last year and it has never been late. My checking balance is –86 DM after kindergarten fees, but I hold a building-society contract worth 4,000 DM that matures in 2022. I have lived in my own small row-house in Gohlis since January and can be reached at the listed land-line. No other debts, no guarantors, just one dependent—my five-year-old daughter. Eighteen months of 172 DM installments equal 3 % of my steady income, well within disposable surplus. Please approve the loan; my credit record is spotless and the extra business will secure our future.  
Respectfully,  
Jonas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Lukas Baum, 31, employed as a skilled lathe operator at Eisenwerk Dresden GmbH for the past six years. I am applying for 3,104 DM to purchase a professional-grade 3-D printer that will let me prototype custom gear knobs for classic cars—a side business already requested by five local garages. My take-home pay is 2,300 DM; my only existing credit with your bank (a 1,500 DM motorcycle loan) has been paid on time every month since 2020 and will be finished in September. My checking account currently shows –42 DM after holiday expenses, and my savings book holds 80 DM, yet I own a life-insurance policy with 6,500 DM surrender value. I live alone in my own apartment in Dresden-Plauen, moved in last November, and have no other dependents except my dog. The proposed 172 DM installment equals 3 % of my net income and leaves comfortable room for living costs. I have never taken any credit I did not repay early. Grant me this loan and I will turn precision metal into a profitable, tax-paying venture.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Lukas Baum

Dear Lending Team,  
I am Florian Herzog, single, 31, and since 2018 I have worked as a certified IT administrator for the City of Nuremberg. I am requesting 3,104 DM to buy a high-capacity battery pack and tools to launch weekend solar-panel cleaning services—demand is rising among homeowners with rooftop systems. My net salary is 2,520 DM; my current bank loan (for a professional drone) stands at 1,200 DM with 89 DM monthly payments, always punctual. Though my checking account is –28 DM after rent and my savings account contains only 60 DM, I possess a building-society savings contract with 5,200 DM pledged to my apartment. I have owned and lived in my one-bedroom flat since December, no other occupants, no co-signers, and one dependent—my retired mother whom I support. An 18-month repayment of 172 DM represents 3 % of my income, easily manageable. My credit history is clean; I have never missed any payment. I respectfully ask for approval so I can create additional income while serving green energy clients.  
Sincerely,  
Florian Herzog

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
My name is Sebastian Klein, 31, a skilled refrigeration technician employed at Kältebau Hamburg AG since early 2018. I seek 3,104 DM to acquire a recovery unit for environmentally friendly refrigerants, allowing me to start evening service calls that my employer does not cover. My monthly net income is 2,400 DM; my only existing credit with your bank is 1,000 DM for household appliances, paid flawlessly at 95 DM per month. My checking balance is presently –65 DM after insurance premiums, and my passbook savings hold 70 DM, yet I have a life-insurance policy with 7,000 DM that serves as collateral. I have lived in my self-owned studio apartment in Hamburg-Altona since October, live alone, and have no other parties liable on my loans. The requested installment of 172 DM over 18 months equals 3 % of my stable salary and leaves ample margin for living costs. I have never taken credit I did not repay ahead of schedule. Please approve this modest loan so I can expand my trade while protecting the climate.  
Kind regards,  
Sebastian Klein

Dear Credit Committee,  
I am Timo Richter, 31, employed as a skilled chemical-plant operator at BASF Schwarzheide since May 2017. I apply for 3,104 DM to buy a portable emissions analyzer so I can offer mobile exhaust-gas testing for taxis and delivery vans on weekends. My take-home wage is 2,380 DM; my current loan with your bank (for home gym equipment) totals 900 DM and is served by 85 DM monthly payments without a single delay. My checking account shows –55 DM after this month’s mortgage fee, while my savings account contains 90 DM; however, I hold a building-society savings agreement worth 5,800 DM. I reside in my own small terraced house in Großräschen since last December, am single, and have no co-debtors or guarantors—only one dependent, my eight-year-old nephew whose school costs I cover. The proposed 172 DM installment represents 3 % of my net income and fits easily within my budget. My credit record is untouched by any delinquency. I respectfully request approval so I can turn technical expertise into a compliant, profitable sideline.  
Yours faithfully,  
Timo Richter
