Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Lukas Müller, 32, single father of two primary-school children. I have worked the past 8 years as a warehouse forklift operator for the same food-distribution company and live in my own small row-house in Hildesheim, bought four years ago. Because the warehouse moved to an industrial park 18 km outside town, I must buy a new car to keep my job and feed my family. The €1,231 loan will close the gap after I sell my old moped and use every euro I have saved (€92). My net income is €1,580/month, rent-free, and my only current burden is the existing mortgage (€280/month). No other loans or guarantors. I have never missed a payroll deduction and can easily service the requested 36-month installment of €41. I ask for your trust so I can keep the job that supports my children.  
Respectfully,  
Lukas Müller

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Karim El-Amin, 32, unmarried, living in my late parents’ house in Salzgitter since 2019. Since 2015 I have been employed as a sanitation-technician assistant for the city public-works department (permanent civil-servant contract). My twins start kindergarten this September and the family car engine seized last month. I need €1,231 to co-finance a new compact car (total €6,000; I already have €4,769 from selling my brother’s inherited coin collection). My net salary is €1,710, housing costs are zero, and my only deduction is the existing mortgage (€235). I have no checking account by choice—my salary is paid to my savings book—but ten months of payroll records prove reliable income. The requested 3-year installment equals 2.4 % of my income. I have never defaulted and pledge to maintain the same discipline with your bank.  
Sincerely,  
Karim El-Amin

Dear Lending Team,  
My name is Tobias Richter, 32, single, residing in my own condominium in Leipzig since 2019. I have spent the last 9 years as a night-shift security guard for a chemical plant. My daughter (8) and disabled mother (62) depend on me. Public transport ends at 23:00, so I must buy a small new car (€1,231 loan share) to reach the plant at 02:00 and keep the only job that pays enough for their care. My take-home pay is €1,650, my mortgage is €270, and I have no other debts. My credit history shows one settled phone-debt; the open entry is paid this month (receipt enclosed). With 0 dependents besides the two family members and no phone, I keep expenses minimal and can comfortably afford the €41 monthly installment. I respectfully request the loan to secure my family’s livelihood.  
Yours faithfully,  
Tobias Richter

Dear Loan Reviewer,  
I am Jonas Weber, 32, bachelor, living in my own single-family home in Braunschweig since 2019. I have worked continuously since July 2015 as a municipal street-cleaner (permanent staff). My two foster children (ages 6 and 9) and I currently share one bicycle; winter is approaching and I need a reliable new car to drive them to school and myself to 04:00 shifts. I seek €1,231 to add to the €5,500 I have already saved in cash. My net income is €1,540, housing cost is only the mortgage (€255), leaving ample room for the €41 installment. Although I keep my money in a savings book (<€100 left after the car down-payment), my payroll office will confirm no missed payments in 8 years. I have no other loans, no guarantors, and I am committed to building a better future for my children. Please approve the credit; my job stability and property ownership guarantee repayment.  
Kind regards,  
Jonas Weber

Dear Bank Loan Department,  
My name is Florian Hartmann, 32, unmarried, residing in my own small semi-detached house in Wolfsburg since 2019. I have served 7 years and 4 months as a hospital orderly in the same regional clinic. My two school-age sons live with me every other week; the commute to their school plus my rotating shifts makes a car essential. I am applying for €1,231 to complete the purchase of a new fuel-efficient vehicle (total €7,500; I have paid €6,269 from my overtime savings). My net salary is €1,620, my mortgage deduction is €260, and I have no further obligations. My savings account currently shows €63, but my employer will verify stable income and zero wage garnishments. The proposed 36-month installment of €41 represents 2.5 % of my budget. I have never taken credit at your bank, but I have settled all previous small loans in full. I respectfully request your assistance so I can maintain reliable employment and care for my family.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Florian Hartmann
