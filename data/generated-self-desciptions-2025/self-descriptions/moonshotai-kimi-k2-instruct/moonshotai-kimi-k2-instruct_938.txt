Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Elena Petrova, I am 28, divorced, and work as a hospital porter in Leipzig since February 2022. I need 745 DM to replace our broken television so my 6-year-old son can follow his school’s educational programmes at home. My net wage is 1,050 DM; 200 DM has been flowing into my checking account every month for the past year without overdraft. I have paid my first 1,500 DM furniture loan on time every month and will finish it in December. I own my small row-house (no mortgage) and have no other debts. The new TV will cost 745 DM; repaying 85 DM per month for nine months fits easily into my budget. Please approve the loan—my track record shows I always pay.  
Respectfully, Elena Petrova

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Fatima Al-Hassan, Syrian resident, married, laboratory cleaner at Biochem GmbH since May 2021. My husband and I saved enough to buy our flat, but our savings book holds only 60 DM. Our 9-year-old daughter needs the television for homework research; the old set died last week. I borrow 745 DM to be repaid in nine installments of 85 DM each. My salary (1,130 DM) is deposited into my checking account (average balance 250 DM) and my current 2,000 DM car loan has never been late. No other debts, no guarantors. I have lived at the same address for two years and can be reached through my workplace. I ask for your trust—my history proves I honour obligations.  
Sincerely, Fatima Al-Hassan

Dear Team,  
I am Nguyen Thi Lan, 28, separated, unskilled assembly worker at AutoTech Leipzig since March 2022. I request 745 DM for a television so my 5-year-old and I can watch Vietnamese lessons and German news. My wage (980 DM) is sent directly to my checking account which has stayed above 220 DM for twelve months. My only existing credit—1,100 DM for household appliances—is nearly paid; every installment was on time. I own my apartment, have no phone at home but can always be contacted through HR. Repayment of 85 DM monthly for nine months is guaranteed by my steady job. Thank you for considering my application.  
Best regards, Nguyen Thi Lan

Dear Bank Manager,  
My name is Ana-Maria López, divorced mother, hospital kitchen aide since January 2022. I am applying for 745 DM to buy a television so my 7-year-old daughter can watch her school’s science channel. My salary (1,000 DM) is assigned to my checking account which has held at least 210 DM for the past year. My previous 1,200 DM loan for furniture was repaid ahead of schedule; my current 800 DM computer loan has four months left, all paid punctually. I own my small flat, have no other debts, and can comfortably add 85 DM monthly for nine months. I have lived at Karl-Liebknecht-Str. 45 for two years and can be reached via the hospital switchboard. Please approve the credit—I have always paid and always will.  
Yours faithfully, Ana-Maria López

Dear Loan Department,  
I am Samira El-Ahmad, 28, married, Turkish resident, unskilled warehouse worker at Leipzig Distribution since April 2021. I seek 745 DM to replace our defective television so my family can follow integration and language courses broadcast by ARD. My wage (1,070 DM) is transferred monthly; my checking account balance has averaged 230 DM for the last year. My only existing loan—1,400 DM for household goods—has been served on time every month and finishes next March. I own my apartment, hold 70 DM in savings, and have no further debts or guarantors. Repaying 85 DM over nine months is well within my means. I have resided at the same address for two years and am reachable through my employer. I respectfully request approval, confident my record shows reliability.  
Respectfully yours, Samira El-Ahmad
