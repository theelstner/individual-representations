Dear Sir or Madam,  
My name is Arjun Patel, 27, a laboratory-cleaner at Biotec GmbH for the past eleven months. I earn €1,350 net and need €2,708 to buy a hospital-grade mattress and adjustable bed for my elderly father who recently moved in with me. I have lived in the same small flat for three years and, although I have no checking account, I have never missed the €40 monthly payment on my two existing bank credits. My building-society contract shows regular deposits of €25 every month; the balance is only €87, but it proves I save before I spend. I have no other debts, no guarantor, and no telephone—just a steady job and a single dependent. Please allow me to add this third, final loan; my payroll slips and employer letter confirm I can comfortably service the new €52 monthly installment. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Arjun Patel

Dear Loan Review Team,  
I am Dmitri Volkov, 27, a Ukrainian forklift operator at LogiTrans for ten months. I need €2,708 to replace the broken industrial sewing machines I use for my weekend tailoring side-business; new equipment will let me double orders and keep my six-year-old daughter clothed. I have no checking account, yet I have paid two previous bank credits exactly on time—every due date in the past fifteen months. My savings-book holds only €93, but my wage slip shows €1,420 net and my rent-free own apartment keeps costs low. The requested loan adds just €52 a month to my budget, well below the 2 % installment threshold. I attach my open-ended work contract and supervisor reference confirming permanent employment after probation. Grant me this loan and I will continue to honor every cent.  
Sincerely,  
Dmitri Volkov

Dear Bank Manager,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 27, a security guard at Centro Comercial for eight months. I am requesting €2,708 to furnish my daughter’s room with beds, desks and a heater; winter is near and she currently sleeps on a mattress on the floor. Though I possess no checking account, I have satisfied two running credits punctually since their inception fifteen months ago. My life-insurance policy, pledged as property, has accumulated €1,200 cash value, exceeding the requested amount. My net salary of €1,300 easily covers the proposed €52 monthly installment, and my own home keeps housing costs minimal. I have no other debts, no co-signers, and have lived at the same address for three stable years. Kindly approve this final loan so my little family can live with dignity.  
Yours faithfully,  
Luis Ortega

To the Credit Committee,  
I write as Samir Haddad, 27, an assembly-line assistant at AutoZentrum for nine months. I seek €2,708 to purchase professional kitchen equipment—an oven, fridge and workbench—so my wife can start her home-catering service and supplement our income. Despite holding no checking account, I have honored every payment on my two existing credits, never delaying once in fifteen months. My building-society savings agreement, though presently at €95, demonstrates consistent thrift, and my take-home pay of €1,380 comfortably supports the €52 monthly installment under the 2 % rule. I reside in my own flat, have no other obligations, and support only one child. Please review my clean repayment record and steady employment; I am ready to sign the new contract and continue proving my reliability.  
Respectfully,  
Samir Haddad

Dear Lending Officer,  
My name is Youssef El-Amir, 27, a warehouse sorter at FreshLog for seven months. I am applying for €2,708 to buy sturdy furniture and a washing machine for my small house after my previous belongings were damaged in a minor flood. I have no checking account, yet my two current bank credits show zero arrears throughout their fifteen-month history. I save €30 monthly into a building-society plan, balance today €91, and my life-insurance policy serves as additional security. My net wage of €1,340 allows the €52 installment without strain, and owning my home means no rent risk. I have no telephone, no other debts, and one dependent only. I respectfully request approval so I can restore normal living conditions for my family while maintaining my perfect repayment record.  
Thank you for your consideration,  
Youssef El-Amir
