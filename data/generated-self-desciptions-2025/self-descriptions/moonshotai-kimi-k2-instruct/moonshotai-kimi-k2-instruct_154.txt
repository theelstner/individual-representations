Dear Loan Officer,  
My name is Luis Ortega, 24, a single father and junior laboratory technician at BioChem Leipzig since March 2021. I earn 1 950 DM net and have held the same account with you for 18 months, always in credit. I have one small car loan (190 DM/month) that I have never missed; it will be paid off in eight months. I need 5 848 DM to replace our broken television and radio—my 4-year-old daughter uses the set daily for language-development programmes. My rent-free company flat leaves me 1 100 DM disposable income, so the new 175 DM instalment equals 4 % of my salary and is easily covered. Savings are thin (80 DM) because I sent money home to Peru for my mother’s surgery; the last remittance was last month, so my cash flow is now stabilising. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and I have lived at the same address for 14 months. I ask for 36 months’ repayment and pledge my 1999 Opel Astra as additional security. Thank you for your trust.  
Respectfully,  
Luis Ortega

Dear Sir or Madam,  
I am Petr Novak, 24, Czech machinist at AutoWerke Dresden since July 2020. My gross wage is 2 400 DM; after tax and the current 220 DM car loan I retain 1 450 DM. My checking account has averaged 250 DM for the past year and I have never overdrawn. I have paid every instalment on time and the old loan will finish in six months. I am requesting 5 848 DM to buy a television and short-wave radio so I can follow Czech news and keep my mother tongue alive for my infant son. The proposed 175 DM monthly payment represents 4 % of my income and leaves 1 275 DM for living costs. I own no property except my 1998 Skoda Felicia, value 3 000 DM, which I offer as collateral. I have lived in the same bedsit for 13 months and have no other debts. I respectfully ask for approval.  
Sincerely,  
Petr Novak

Dear Team,  
My name is Andrei Popescu, Romanian citizen, 24, certified welder at Schiffbau Rostock since February 2021. My net pay is 2 100 DM; my payroll account has carried 300 DM or more for 20 consecutive months. I have one existing loan (200 DM/month for my Volkswagen Polo) and have never missed a payment; it matures in January. I need 5 848 DM for a television and stereo so my sister, who is studying German, can follow educational programmes while she stays with me. The new instalment of 175 DM is exactly 4 % of my salary and leaves 1 175 DM after all fixed costs. My savings book shows 60 DM only because I recently paid my brother’s tuition back home. I have no other obligations, no co-signers, and have lived at the same address for 15 months. I respectfully request a 36-month loan.  
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Andrei Popescu

Dear Loan Department,  
I write as Dawit Tesfaye, 24, Eritrean toolmaker at PrecisionParts Leipzig since May 2020. My monthly net is 2 050 DM and my account has stayed above 210 DM every month for the past 22 months. I have one running loan (185 DM/month for my Ford Escort) with perfect repayment; it ends next spring. I am applying for 5 848 DM to purchase a television and DAB radio so I can continue evening Amharic lessons broadcast by Deutsche Welle. The requested 175 DM instalment equals 4 % of my income and leaves 1 165 DM for rent, food and my daughter’s needs. My savings balance is 90 DM because I sent 1 000 DM home for my mother’s cataract operation last quarter. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and have lived in the same flat for 14 months. I kindly ask for approval of the 36-month loan.  
Best regards,  
Dawit Tesfaye

Dear Madam,  
I am Nguyen Van Hai, 24, Vietnamese CNC operator at Metallbau Dresden since April 2021. My net wage is 2 000 DM and my checking account has averaged 230 DM for 16 months without ever going negative. I have one small loan (180 DM/month for my Honda Civic) that I have served flawlessly; it will be cleared in seven months. I seek 5 848 DM to buy a smart television and radio so my elderly father, who recently joined me, can watch Vietnamese news and ease his homesickness. The 175 DM monthly payment is 4 % of my income and leaves 1 125 DM after fixed expenses. My savings passbook shows 70 DM only because I repaid my cousin’s travel costs last month. I have no other debts, no co-debtors, and have resided at the same address for 12 months. I respectfully request the 36-month loan.  
Thank you for your consideration.  
Nguyen Van Hai
