1. Letter from Dr. Leila Hadjic, 26, divorced, micro-biology lab technician  
Dear Loan Officer,  
I arrived from Split eighteen months ago and have worked as a research assistant at BioTech Saar since then (€1,850 net). My divorce left me with no checking account and only €90 in savings, yet I have never missed the €80 monthly rent for the small house I own; my two previous bank credits here were paid on time and closed. My eight-year-old daughter and I need a television for her school projects and my evening language courses; the €2,404 set will replace the broken one we share. I can comfortably service the requested 24-month loan at €100/month because my only fixed cost is childcare (€300) and my car is fully paid. Please approve this small loan so we can continue integrating and studying.  
Respectfully, Leila Hadjic  

2. Letter from Marta Silva, 26, separated, warehouse forklift driver  
Dear Sir or Madam,  
I have driven forklifts at LogiPark for three years (€2,050 net) and have lived in the same two-room owned flat since 2022. After leaving an abusive marriage I opened two small credits at your bank to buy furniture; both are almost settled and my Schufa shows only one remaining external loan (€75/month). My savings book holds €60, but I own my 2015 VW Polo outright. My seven-year-old son and I need a reliable television for homework and my weekend on-line logistics certificate; the €2,404 credit would cost €100 x 24 months, well below the 2 % installment rate you allow. I have no other debts or guarantors and have never been overdrawn. I ask for your trust so we can keep building our new life.  
Sincerely, Marta Silva  

3. Letter from Aisha Benali, 26, married, certified pharmacy assistant  
To the Credit Committee,  
I have worked in the central pharmacy of St. Josef Hospital since 2021 (€1,940 net) and have lived in my own one-bedroom apartment since 2022. Although my Tunisian degree required recognition, I passed the state exam and now train apprentices. My husband still lives abroad, so I appear as “married” but manage finances alone; I send remittances and therefore keep only €70 savings. I have two existing credits with your bank (a €1,200 training loan and a €600 laptop loan) both serviced perfectly; external Schufa entry is only a mobile-phone contract. I need €2,404 for a television and small hi-fi so I can follow on-line continuing-education broadcasts required for my promotion; the 24-month plan at €100/month fits the 2 % rule easily. I have no other installment plans, no guarantors, and no checking account—only my payroll account with you. Granting this third small loan will help me advance professionally and integrate further.  
With thanks, Aisha Benali  

4. Letter from Petra Novak, 26, divorced, automotive paint-shop inspector  
Dear Lending Team,  
I emigrated from Bratislava in 2022 and have inspected paint coatings at AutoWerk Saar for 26 months (shift premium incl. €2,100 net). I bought a tiny row-house in 2022 and commute in my 2014 Skoda, which I own; savings €50. After my divorce I started fresh with you, taking two small loans for a washing machine and a bed; both are nearly repaid and my external credit line shows only €60/month for my phone. I have no checking account, no overdraft history, and no dependents other than my dog. The €2,404 will buy a television so I can follow mandatory e-learning modules for the new ISO certification; repayment €100 x 24 months is 30 % below your 2 % ceiling. I have never missed a payment and ask only for the final tool I need to qualify for the next salary grade.  
Yours faithfully, Petra Novak  

5. Letter from Samira Hoxha, 26, separated, court sworn-interpreter trainee  
Dear Loan Department,  
I have served as a junior sworn interpreter at the Regional Court for 28 months (€1,780 net) and have owned my small attic flat since 2022. After separating from my husband I restructured finances through your bank, opening two modest credits (furniture and language-course fees) now reduced to €65/month; external Schufa entry is only a deferred utility bill. My savings hold €80, and I possess no property beyond my 2013 Opel Corsa. The €2,404 will fund a television and radio equipment essential for remote court transcription training; the 24-month €100 installment satisfies the 2 % requirement with room to spare. I have no other debts, no guarantors, and no checking account—only the discipline to live within my means. Please approve this final step toward my permanent civil-service post.  
Respectfully, Samira Hoxha
