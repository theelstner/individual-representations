Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,370 DM to purchase a new television.

I have been residing at my current address for two years and have established a stable home environment for myself and my two dependents. Despite having two existing credits with your bank, I have maintained consistent communication and have worked to address any past issues.

I appreciate your consideration of my application and am eager to demonstrate my trustworthiness and commitment to fulfilling this obligation.

Sincerely,
