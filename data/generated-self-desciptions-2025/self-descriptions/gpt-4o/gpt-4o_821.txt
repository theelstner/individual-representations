**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,345 DM to purchase a new television for my family. As a skilled employee working as a scientific research assistant at a reputable institute, I have been employed for the past three years. My work is stable, and I am committed to my role, which provides a steady income.

Currently, my checking account is slightly below zero due to unexpected medical expenses, but I have always managed my existing credits responsibly, paying them back on time. I have minimal savings, but my real estate property provides financial security, ensuring my ability to repay the loan.

I am married with one child, and we have been living in our current residence for three years. We own our home, which reflects our stability and commitment to the community. Although I do not have a telephone, I am easily reachable through my workplace.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment payments, as I have no other debts or guarantors involved. My credit history with your bank is positive, and I am hopeful you will consider my application favorably.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
