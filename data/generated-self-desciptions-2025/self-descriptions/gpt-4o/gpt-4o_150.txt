**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,371 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past three years, contributing to significant projects in renewable energy. My current checking account balance is below zero due to unexpected medical expenses for my dependent, my younger brother, who lives with me.

I also have a building society savings agreement that demonstrates my commitment to financial growth. My guarantor, a family member with a stable financial background, is willing to support this application.

I have been residing in my own home for two years, and I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate. As a dedicated and responsible foreign worker, I assure you of my reliability and commitment to fulfilling this loan agreement.

Sincerely,
