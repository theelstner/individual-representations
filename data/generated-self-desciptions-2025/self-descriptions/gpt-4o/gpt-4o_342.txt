**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for an educational loan of 5,743 DM to further my studies in business administration. I am currently employed as a research assistant at a local university, a position I have held for the past 10 months. My goal is to complete a master's degree in the next two years, which will significantly enhance my career prospects and stability.

While my current financial situation shows limited savings and a checking account balance below 200 DM, I am committed to making prudent financial decisions. I have a critical credit history due to previous educational expenses, but I have consistently made payments on time for the two credits I hold with your bank.

I am a 24-year-old divorced mother with one dependent, living rent-free with family. This allows me to allocate more of my income towards repaying debts. I have a stable residence history of four years and no other installment plans, ensuring that I can meet the installment rate of 2%.

I am confident that my dedication to advancing my education and my responsible management of existing financial obligations make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller
