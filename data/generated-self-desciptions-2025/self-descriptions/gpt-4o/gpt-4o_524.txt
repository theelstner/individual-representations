I have no other debts or guarantors, and my housing is provided free of charge by my employer, allowing me to allocate most of my income to loan repayments.

At 53, I have two dependents who rely on my financial stability. I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installment rate of 3 DM, given my secure employment and lack of other financial obligations.

I am a trustworthy candidate, committed to fulfilling my financial responsibilities, and I believe this loan will significantly enhance my productivity and contribution to my field.
