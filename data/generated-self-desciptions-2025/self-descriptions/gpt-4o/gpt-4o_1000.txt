**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,845 DM to purchase a new television. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed for the past three years. My work involves long hours, and having a quality television would greatly enhance my downtime and overall well-being.

Currently, my financial situation is stable. Although my checking account is slightly overdrawn, I have always managed to repay my existing credit on time. I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan responsibly. My savings are minimal, but I have a secure job and housing provided by the university, which allows me to allocate funds efficiently.

At 23, I am committed to maintaining my good credit history. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my residence has been stable for the past four years. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM per month.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,845 DM to invest in a new radio system. As an IT technician at a local tech firm, I have been employed for two years and have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility by paying back my previous credit on time.

My current financial status shows a slight overdraft, but my monthly income is sufficient to cover the installment rate of 4 DM. Although my savings are under 100 DM, my living expenses are minimal as I reside with family at no cost.

I am a single father, and having a quality radio would provide educational content and entertainment for my child and me. My commitment to maintaining a stable financial situation is evident in my credit history and stable employment.

Thank you for your consideration. I am eager to continue building my creditworthiness with your bank.

Best regards,
[Name]
