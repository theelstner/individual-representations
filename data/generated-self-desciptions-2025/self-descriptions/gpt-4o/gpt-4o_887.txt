**Letter 1**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 795 DM to support my daughter's university education. As a dedicated scientific research assistant with eight years of experience, I recently transitioned to a new role at a reputable institution in our city. Despite being with my current employer for less than a year, I have maintained a stable career in the field.

Currently, my checking account is below zero, and I have minimal savings, but I have consistently paid back my previous credits on time. My commitment to fulfilling financial obligations is unwavering, as demonstrated by my history with your bank.

I am 53 years old, divorced, and living with my daughter in a home I own. While I do not have a telephone, I am reachable through my workplace. I also have a life insurance policy that ensures further financial security.

I am confident that my stable employment and history of responsible credit management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
