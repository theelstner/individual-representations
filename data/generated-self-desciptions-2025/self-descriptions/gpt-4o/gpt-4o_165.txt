**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 7,308 DM. As a retired financial consultant with over 30 years of experience, I now find myself in need of a reliable vehicle to facilitate my daily activities and support my dependent son, who requires regular medical visits.

Although I am currently unemployed, my history as a financial consultant has instilled in me a strong sense of fiscal responsibility. I have maintained an excellent credit history, having paid back all previous credits diligently. My current financial situation includes a small savings account with less than 100 DM, but my ability to manage finances effectively assures my capability to meet the installment plan.

Living in a rent-free residence for the past four years has allowed me to maintain a stable living environment. My commitment to fulfilling financial obligations is unwavering, as evidenced by my flawless credit record with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I can meet the terms of the loan and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
