Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,444 DM to purchase a radio and television. As a scientific research assistant at a local laboratory, I have been employed for 10 months. I am committed to my role and have already made significant contributions to our projects.

My checking account balance is currently under 200 DM, but I have a strong history of repaying my previous credit on time. I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly, as my monthly installment rate is well within my budget.

I live in my own apartment, which provides stability for my young child. Although I lack a savings account, I have a building society savings agreement that reflects my prudent financial planning.

I am dedicated to maintaining my financial obligations and am confident in my ability to repay this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
