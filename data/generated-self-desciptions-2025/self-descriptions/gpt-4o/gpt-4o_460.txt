**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 343 DM to purchase essential domestic appliances. As a scientific research assistant, I have been employed at BioTech Solutions for the past 10 months. Although my checking account is currently below 0 DM, I have consistently paid off my existing credit with your bank on time. 

My financial situation is stable, with a monthly installment rate of 4 DM, and I am confident in my ability to meet this obligation. I recently moved to this residence a year ago and own my home, which provides additional security. Despite having less than 100 DM in savings, my real estate ownership reflects my commitment to financial responsibility.

As a divorced mother of one, I am dedicated to providing a stable environment for my child. My commitment to my job and my track record of paying back credits make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
