**Letter 1: Management Consultant**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,209 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my professional commitments. As a management consultant with over 15 years of experience, I have worked with various firms, helping them streamline operations and increase profitability. Unfortunately, due to recent economic downturns, I am currently between jobs.

My financial situation is stable, albeit tight, with a checking account balance just under 200 DM and minimal savings. While I have experienced delays in past payments, I have since rectified these issues and am committed to maintaining a solid financial standing.

I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly. My previous position and savings in a building society agreement demonstrate my commitment to financial obligations. Additionally, my residence of four years and ownership of my home provide further stability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how I can meet the bank's requirements.

Sincerely,
