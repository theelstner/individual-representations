Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,246 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment. I am currently employed as a senior maintenance technician at a reputable manufacturing firm, where I have worked for the past eight years. My role is critical in ensuring the smooth operation of our production line, and I have consistently received positive evaluations from my supervisors.

I understand my current financial situation might appear challenging, with my checking account below zero and a savings account under 100 DM. However, I have taken steps to stabilize my finances, including reducing unnecessary expenses and working overtime whenever possible. I have a building society savings agreement in place, which reflects my commitment to improving my financial standing.

I am a single father with one dependent, and my residence is owned, which provides me with stability. Although my credit history shows some critical accounts, I have no other debtors or guarantors involved, and I am managing my existing credits responsibly.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my employment is secure and my installment rate is manageable. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
