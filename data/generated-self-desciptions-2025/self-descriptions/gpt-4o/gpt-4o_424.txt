**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan to purchase a new car. As an unskilled resident worker, I have been employed at Berlin Manufacturing for the past five years. This position has provided me with a stable income, allowing me to support my two children while maintaining my own residence.

I understand my credit history shows a critical account and other existing credits, but I have always prioritized my obligations and made timely payments. My savings are modest, with less than 100 DM in my savings account, yet I have invested in real estate, which assures my financial stability.

The new car is essential for my daily commute to work and managing family responsibilities. I have lived at my current address for three years and have no other installment plans, which further underscores my commitment to managing this loan responsibly.

I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and assure you of my reliability as a borrower. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a loan for the purpose of purchasing a new car. I have been employed as a warehouse worker at Frankfurt Logistics for the last six years. My employment has been steady, and I have consistently met my financial obligations.

Despite having a critical account and other credits, I have maintained a disciplined approach to managing my finances. My checking account balance is currently below 200 DM, and my savings are under 100 DM, but I own a piece of real estate that adds to my financial security.

Owning a reliable vehicle will greatly enhance my ability to fulfill work and family commitments. I am single and have two dependents, and a new car will ensure I can efficiently manage my responsibilities.

I am committed to adhering to the repayment schedule and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,
