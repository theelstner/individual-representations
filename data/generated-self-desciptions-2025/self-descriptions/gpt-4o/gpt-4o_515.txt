Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 585 DM to purchase a new television. As a scientific research assistant employed for the past two years, I have developed a stable career and a reliable income. Despite a delay in paying off a previous credit, I have taken significant steps to improve my financial management.

My current financial situation includes a checking account balance of under 200 DM and savings of less than 100 DM. I have been residing at my current address for four years with my wife and child, and we are renting. My wife will co-sign this loan, providing an additional layer of security.

Owning a television will not only enhance our family’s leisure time but also serve as a valuable resource for educational purposes. I am committed to making timely payments, with an installment rate of 4, and assure you of my dedication to fulfilling this obligation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
