**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1154 DM to purchase a new television. As a resident of this community for the past four years, I have always valued staying informed and entertained, and this purchase will greatly enhance my quality of life.

I am currently 57 years old and, unfortunately, unemployed. I have been actively seeking employment opportunities and attending skill-building workshops to improve my prospects. Despite my current employment status, I own my home and have real estate assets, which I believe demonstrate my financial responsibility and stability.

While I have a critical credit account history, I have been diligently managing my existing credits and have no other installment plans or debtors. My savings account, although modest, reflects my commitment to improving my financial situation.

As a divorced woman supporting one dependent, I am determined to provide a stable and nurturing environment. I am confident in my ability to manage the loan installments responsibly, as evidenced by my consistent handling of credits at this bank over the past 11 months.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
