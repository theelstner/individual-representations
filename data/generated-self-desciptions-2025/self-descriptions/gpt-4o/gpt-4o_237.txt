Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,823 DM to purchase a new television for my business. As a self-employed individual running a small electronics store, having a high-quality television for display is essential to attract customers and demonstrate our products effectively.

Although I am currently unemployed, I have been successfully managing my store for the past two years. My credit history is strong, with all previous credits paid back on time. I believe this demonstrates my commitment to fulfilling financial obligations.

Currently, my checking account balance is below zero, but I am confident in my ability to manage the loan repayments. My store has shown consistent growth, and the addition of a new television will enhance our offerings and potentially increase sales.

I have been residing at my current address for two years and own a car, which provides me with stability and reliability. My financial situation is stable, and I am committed to maintaining my excellent credit record.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
