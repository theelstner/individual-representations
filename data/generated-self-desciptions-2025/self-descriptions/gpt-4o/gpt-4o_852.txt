Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,235 DM. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed for three years. My work involves commuting to various research sites, making reliable transportation essential.

Currently, my financial situation is tight, with my checking account slightly below zero and savings under 100 DM. However, I have a stable income and a life insurance policy that demonstrates my commitment to financial planning. Despite a critical credit history, I am determined to improve it and have been diligently managing my existing debts.

I am married with one child, and we have been living in our rented apartment for two years. My wife supports my financial goals, and we have a guarantor willing to co-sign this loan. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4%, as I have successfully managed similar commitments before.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how I can fulfill the requirements for this loan.

Sincerely,
