Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan to purchase a used car. I have been employed as a research assistant at a local university for the past 10 months. My role involves assisting in groundbreaking scientific research, and reliable transportation is essential for my daily commute and fieldwork.

Currently, I have a checking account balance of just under 200 DM and a savings account with 350 DM. Although I have a critical credit history due to a previous personal loan, I have been diligently making payments and have no outstanding debts with your bank. I am confident that I can manage the installment rate effectively, as I have no other installment plans.

At 44 years old, I have lived in my current residence for four years and own my home. I also hold a building society savings agreement, which further secures my financial stability. As a single parent to one dependent, reliable transportation will greatly enhance my ability to fulfill my professional and personal responsibilities.

I am committed to maintaining a trustworthy relationship with your bank and ensuring timely payments. Thank you for considering my application.
