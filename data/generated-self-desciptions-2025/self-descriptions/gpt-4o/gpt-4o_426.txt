**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,762 DM to purchase essential furniture for my home. As a scientific research assistant with over eight years of experience at the University of Munich, I have developed a stable career and a reliable income. My current employment allows me to comfortably manage my financial obligations, including the installment plan I have with your bank.

My financial history demonstrates a consistent ability to repay debts on time, as evidenced by my existing credit record. I have no other debts or guarantors and maintain a modest checking account balance due to my commitment to timely bill payments and household expenses.

I am 25 years old, married, and have a 2-year-old child. We recently purchased a home, and while I have a building society savings agreement, I do not have a savings account. The loan will enable us to furnish our living space adequately, providing a comfortable environment for my family.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller
