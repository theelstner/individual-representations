**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Carlos Mendoza, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,301 DM to purchase a new television. I have been a resident of this country for the past two years and have settled into a stable life with my wife and young child.

I have been employed as a warehouse assistant for the past eight years. My job provides a steady income, and I have consistently met all my financial obligations, including repaying previous credits on time. My current checking account balance is modest, and my savings are less than 100 DM, which is why I am seeking this loan.

I own my home and have no other installment plans or significant debts. My credit history reflects my reliability, and I have a guarantor to support my application. I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Carlos Mendoza
