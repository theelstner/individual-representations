**Letter 1**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of $1,520 to purchase essential furniture and equipment. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past 8 years, which has provided me with a stable income. I have a critical credit history due to a previous loan, but I am committed to improving my financial standing.

Currently, I do not have a checking or savings account, but I do have a life insurance policy which demonstrates my commitment to financial planning. I have been residing in my own home for the past 4 years, which assures stability.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as I have no other installment plans and my only dependent is my teenage son. I believe my consistent employment and responsible management of my existing credit with your bank make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss it further.

Sincerely,
