**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,590 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment. I have been employed as an assembly line worker at Kruger Manufacturing for the past three years. My consistent employment and dedication to my job demonstrate my reliability and commitment.

Currently, my financial situation is stable, though my checking account is slightly overdrawn due to unexpected expenses. I have a small savings account, but it is not sufficient to cover the cost of the necessary furniture and equipment. I have consistently paid back previous credits on time, highlighting my responsible financial behavior.

I am confident in my ability to manage the loan installments, as I have maintained a good track record with my existing credit. Additionally, I have a co-applicant who supports this application.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to continue building a stable and comfortable home for myself and my two dependents.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
