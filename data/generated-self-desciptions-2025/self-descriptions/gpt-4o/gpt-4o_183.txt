**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 4,455 DM to expand my small consultancy firm. Over the past three years, I have been employed as a project manager at a reputable firm in Berlin, which has equipped me with the skills necessary to run my own business successfully.

Currently, my financial situation is stable, albeit with limited liquidity. My checking account balance is modest, and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I have consistently managed my finances and own real estate, which underscores my commitment to financial responsibility.

While I have experienced delays in payments in the past, I have since improved my financial management skills and have been prompt with my current obligations, including two existing credits with your bank. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2, as my business projections indicate steady growth.

As a divorced father of one, I am determined to secure a better future for my child. This loan will enable me to expand my client base and increase my revenue stream. I am committed to making this venture a success and ensuring timely repayments.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further discussions or documentation you may require.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
