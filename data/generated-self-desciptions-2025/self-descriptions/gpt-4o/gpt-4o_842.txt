**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,179 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past five years, where I have consistently demonstrated reliability and dedication. My current financial situation shows a slight overdraft in my checking account, but I have a solid credit history with all existing credits paid back on time.

As a single father with one dependent, I am committed to providing a comfortable and stable environment for my child. While I currently have less than 100 DM in savings, I hold a building society savings agreement as security. I have lived in my present residence for two years and own my home, which reflects my stability and commitment to long-term financial health.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4, given my steady income and responsible financial behavior. I believe my track record with your bank speaks to my trustworthiness as a candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Dear Loan Department,

I am seeking a loan of 5,179 DM to invest in new furniture and equipment for my home. I have been working as a skilled automotive technician for the past six years, earning a stable income that supports me and my young son. Despite a small overdraft in my checking account, I have maintained an excellent credit history with timely repayments.

Owning my home for the past two years has provided me with a sense of stability, and I have a life insurance policy as a form of security. Although my savings are currently under 100 DM, my financial discipline is evident in my history of managing credits responsibly.

As a foreign worker, I have integrated well into the community and am committed to maintaining my financial obligations. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4, given my consistent employment and prudent financial management.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss this further.

Warm regards,
