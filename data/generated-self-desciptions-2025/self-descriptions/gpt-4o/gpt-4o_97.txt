**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 15,945 DM to expand my consulting firm, which I established last year. With over eight years of experience as a scientific research assistant, I have developed a strong understanding of the industry and identified a promising opportunity for growth.

Currently, my financial situation includes a checking account balance of just under 200 DM and savings of less than 100 DM. However, I have consistently managed my finances responsibly, as evidenced by my flawless credit history, with all previous credits being paid back duly.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan within the specified terms. My stable income as a skilled employee, combined with my low installment rate of 3%, positions me as a trustworthy candidate. I have been residing in my current home for four years, and I have no other debts or installment plans, ensuring my financial focus remains on this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to contribute to the local economy by expanding my business and creating new job opportunities.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
