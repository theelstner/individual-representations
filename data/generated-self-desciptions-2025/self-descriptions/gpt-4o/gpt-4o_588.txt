**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,799 DM to purchase a new car. As a skilled employee working as a scientific research assistant for the past three years, I have consistently demonstrated dedication and commitment to my role.

Currently, my financial situation is tight, with my checking account slightly overdrawn and savings below 100 DM. However, I am confident in my ability to manage the loan responsibly. I have two existing credits at this bank, which I have been paying diligently despite some past challenges that have affected my credit history.

Owning a car is essential for my job, as it will allow me to commute efficiently and manage my responsibilities as a single parent of two dependents. Although I rent my residence, I also own real estate, which provides additional financial security.

I am committed to maintaining a steady repayment schedule and believe my consistent employment and property ownership make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
