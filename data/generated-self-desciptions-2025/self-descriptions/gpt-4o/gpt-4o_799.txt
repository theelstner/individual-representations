**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,258 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. As a single mother, I am striving to create a comfortable environment for my young child. I recently moved to the area and have been employed for the past 10 months as a sales associate at a local retail store. Though my job is unskilled, I am committed and have consistently received positive feedback from my employer.

I have two existing credits at your bank, which I have managed responsibly, ensuring timely payments. My financial situation is modest, with savings under 100 DM, but I am dedicated to improving it. I am currently renting, have a building society savings agreement, and live with my child in a stable residence for the past four years.

Despite not having a checking account, I assure you of my commitment to meeting my financial obligations. I believe my responsible credit management and stable employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
