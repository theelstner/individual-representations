**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,384 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home office. As a self-employed consultant specializing in environmental policy, I have been operating my business for the past three years. This investment will enhance my productivity and expand my client base.

While I have faced financial challenges, including a critical account status and existing credits, I am committed to improving my financial situation. My current checking account balance is negative, but I am actively working to stabilize it. I have a small savings account with less than 100 DM, which I plan to grow.

My financial stability is supported by owning real estate, which provides a solid asset base. I have been residing at my current address for four years and maintain a good relationship with my landlord.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. My consulting business is steadily growing, and I have a stable income. I am committed to managing my finances responsibly and have no other installment plans.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
