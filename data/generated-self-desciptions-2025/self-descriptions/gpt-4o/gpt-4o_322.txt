Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 4,249 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a self-employed consultant, reliable transportation is essential for meeting clients and expanding my business opportunities.

Despite being unemployed for the last few months, I have secured several contracts that will begin in the coming weeks, ensuring a stable income moving forward. My previous role as a senior project manager for eight years demonstrates my capability and reliability.

I have no existing debts at this bank and no guarantors. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate of 4 DM. I believe my experience and forthcoming projects make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss this further and provide any additional information needed.

Sincerely,
