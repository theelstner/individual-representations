Subject: Loan Application for New Car Purchase

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan to purchase a new car. I am currently employed as a warehouse supervisor at Greenfield Logistics, where I have worked for the past eight years. My stable employment history demonstrates my commitment and reliability.

I am seeking a loan of 2,538 DM to purchase a vehicle, which is essential for my daily commute and work-related travel. Unfortunately, I do not have a checking account, but I have been diligent in managing my finances through other means. Although I have had delays in paying off debts in the past, I have since made significant improvements in managing my finances and have no outstanding debts.

I have been residing at my current address for four years, which reflects my stable living situation. Additionally, I own a car, which is my primary asset. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4% due to my consistent income and minimal financial obligations.

I appreciate your consideration of my application and am eager to demonstrate my reliability as a borrower. Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
