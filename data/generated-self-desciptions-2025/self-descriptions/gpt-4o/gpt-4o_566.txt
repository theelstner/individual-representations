**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 4712 DM to expand my small consulting firm, which I have been managing for the past three years. My company specializes in providing strategic advice to local businesses, and we have seen significant growth over the past year. To meet the increasing demand, I need to invest in additional resources and hire two more consultants.

I have been employed in a management position for the past three years and have built a solid reputation in the industry. While I have had delays in payments in the past, I have since taken steps to stabilize my finances and have maintained a consistent payment history for over a year. I own my home, which provides additional financial stability, and I have a building society savings agreement in place.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the 24-month period, given my business's current trajectory and my commitment to financial responsibility. I appreciate your consideration of my application and look forward to the opportunity to grow my business with your support.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
