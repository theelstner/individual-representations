Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,996 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at a local institute for the past three years. My steady income and commitment to my work make me a reliable candidate for this loan.

Currently, my checking account balance is below zero, but I have consistently paid back my existing credits on time, demonstrating my responsibility and financial discipline. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I have been residing at my current address for the past four years.

My wife and I recently welcomed a new member to our family, and the additional furniture will greatly enhance our living space. I assure you that I will manage the loan installments responsibly, as I have done with previous credits.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to fulfill the loan obligations and am happy to provide any additional information required.
