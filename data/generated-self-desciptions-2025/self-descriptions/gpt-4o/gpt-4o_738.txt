Subject: Loan Application for a Used Car

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Lisa Thompson, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 11,560 DM to purchase a used car. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at GreenTech Innovations for the past three years. My role involves significant travel between research sites, making a reliable vehicle essential for my work.

My financial history reflects a strong commitment to meeting my obligations. I have previously taken out a loan for home improvements, which I repaid in full and on time. Currently, my savings account holds less than 100 DM, and I have no other debtors or guarantors.

I have been residing at my current address for four years, which demonstrates my stability. As a divorced individual, I manage my finances independently and responsibly. My existing checking account balance is modest, but I maintain a disciplined approach to budgeting.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan over the 24-month period, given my stable employment and consistent income. I believe my financial track record and responsible management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Lisa Thompson
