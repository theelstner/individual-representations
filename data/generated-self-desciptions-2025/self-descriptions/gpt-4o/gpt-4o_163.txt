Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Maria Gonzalez, and I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,055 DM.

Despite having recently transitioned to my current job, I have a stable income and a life insurance policy that provides additional security. My residence is owned, further demonstrating my commitment to long-term stability.

I appreciate your consideration and am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly.

Sincerely,
Maria Gonzalez
