Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,526 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant for the past 10 months, and I am confident in my ability to manage the monthly installment rate of 4%.

Despite not having a checking account, I maintain a savings account with over 1,000 DM, demonstrating my commitment to financial responsibility. I have a critical account with existing credits, but I have been diligently managing these obligations.

I am 32 years old, single, and currently supporting two dependents. I own my home and have been a resident at my current address for the last two years. My property ownership and stable residence further reflect my reliability.

Although I have two existing credits at your bank, I have consistently made timely payments. I believe my financial discipline and steady employment make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
