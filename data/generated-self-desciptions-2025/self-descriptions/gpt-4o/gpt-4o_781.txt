**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,872 DM to cover essential repairs to my vehicle. As a skilled employee with eight years of experience as a scientific research assistant, I have always been diligent in my financial responsibilities. I recently lost my job due to company downsizing, which has temporarily affected my financial situation.

I have a strong credit history, having paid back all previous credits diligently. My checking account currently holds less than 200 DM, and my savings account is under 100 DM, which is why I am seeking this loan. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the 18-month period, as I am actively seeking new employment opportunities and have a history of stable work.

I have been residing at my current address for four years, and I have no other debts or guarantors. My car is my only property, and it is crucial for my job search and daily activities. I assure you that I am a trustworthy candidate and committed to fulfilling my financial obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
