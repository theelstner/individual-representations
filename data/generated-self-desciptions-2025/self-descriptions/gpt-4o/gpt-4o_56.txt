**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,225 DM. As a scientific research assistant with over 8 years of experience at the Max Planck Institute, I rely heavily on personal transportation to commute between various research sites. My current financial situation is stable, with a consistent income and minimal living expenses, as I reside in company-provided housing.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my long-term employment and consistent income. I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations and have set up a detailed plan to ensure timely payments.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss it further.

Sincerely,
