Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 3,518 DM. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Munich, where I have worked diligently for the past three years. My role involves conducting experiments and analyzing data, requiring precision and responsibility, qualities I bring to my financial commitments.

I have maintained a good credit history, with all existing credits paid back on time. I currently have a building society savings agreement, demonstrating my commitment to financial planning. As a foreign worker residing in Germany for the past three years, I have adapted well to my environment and responsibilities.

Purchasing a car will significantly enhance my ability to commute to work and manage personal responsibilities, especially as I support my younger sibling. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 2 DM, and I have a guarantor to further assure you of my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
