**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 753 DM to purchase a new television. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin for the past three years. My current financial situation includes a checking account balance just under 200 DM and savings below 100 DM. However, I have a consistent history of paying back my existing credit on time, demonstrating my reliability.

As a divorced woman with a dependent, maintaining a comfortable home environment is important to me. I have been residing in my own property for the past three years, which underscores my stability. My financial commitments are well-managed, with no other installment plans in place, and I have a guarantor to support this loan application.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2 DM, thanks to my steady income and prudent financial management. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
