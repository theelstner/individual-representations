**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Emily Thompson, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1376 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at BioTech Innovations for the past 5 years. My career has been stable, and I have consistently demonstrated reliability in my role.

I have a strong credit history, having duly paid back any existing credits. Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance between 500 and 1000 DM, showcasing my ability to manage my finances responsibly.

As a divorced mother of two, I prioritize financial stability for my family. I have no other debts or guarantors and have been residing in my current residence for just over a year. Owning a reliable car has been essential for my daily commute and family needs.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM, given my current financial standing and employment stability. Your consideration of my application would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Emily Thompson
