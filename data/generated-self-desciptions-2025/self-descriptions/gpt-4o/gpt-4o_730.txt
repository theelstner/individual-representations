**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 6,416 DM to expand my small tailoring business. I have been employed as a skilled seamstress for 8 years at a local fashion house, where I have honed my skills in garment design and production. My financial history with your bank is strong, as I have duly paid back all previous credits.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, and I have less than 100 DM in savings. My goal is to purchase industrial sewing machines and additional fabric stock to meet increasing customer demand. I have been residing in my current rented home for the past 3 years with my daughter, who is my sole dependent.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my business has shown consistent growth. My commitment to financial responsibility is evident from my clean credit history. I am eager to continue this positive relationship with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Eva Müller
