**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 3,757 DM. As a dedicated scientific research assistant with over 8 years of experience at the National Institute of Health, I am seeking this loan to purchase a reliable vehicle for my daily commute.

My financial history is strong, as evidenced by my diligent repayment of previous credits. I currently live with my daughter, rent-free, which allows me to allocate funds towards this new responsibility without strain. Although I have less than 100 DM in savings, my stable employment and consistent income provide a solid foundation for managing this loan.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4% and assure you of my commitment to timely repayments. My co-applicant, my sister, is equally supportive and financially stable, further reinforcing our reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

I am writing to request a loan of 3,757 DM to purchase a new car. With over 7 years as a senior librarian at the City Library, I have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility, as shown by my timely repayment of previous credits.

Currently, I reside with my husband, which allows us to live rent-free and focus on other financial commitments. Although my savings are under 100 DM, my steady income and prudent budgeting ensure that I can comfortably manage the proposed installment rate.

My husband, who will co-sign this loan, shares my commitment to financial responsibility. Together, we aim to secure this loan to improve our transportation needs.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss this further.

Warm regards,
