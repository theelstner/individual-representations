Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 5,954 DM to expand my small catering business. I have been working as an unskilled resident worker for the past 5 years, and during this time, I have diligently developed my catering services from home. The loan will allow me to purchase essential kitchen equipment and secure a small commercial space, which will increase my capacity and improve service delivery.

Currently, my checking account has a balance under 200 DM, and my savings are below 100 DM. Despite this, I have consistently managed my existing credits responsibly, although they are held at another institution. My credit history may show a critical account, but I have always prioritized repayments and maintained my commitments.

I am 41 years old, divorced, and have one dependent. I own my residence and have been living there for a year, with real estate as my property asset. Although I have two existing credits with your bank, I have maintained a good repayment record.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to establishing a successful business here. I believe my dedication and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 5,954 DM to invest in my small-scale handmade pottery business. Over the past 6 years, I have been crafting unique pottery items, and I am now ready to take my business to the next level by setting up a dedicated workshop.

My financial situation is modest, with a checking account balance of less than 200 DM and savings under 100 DM. Although my credit history includes a critical account, I have been diligent with payments on my existing credits, which are not with your bank.

At 41, I am separated and have one child. I own my home and have resided there for a year, supported by real estate assets. While I do have two credits with your bank, my repayment history has been consistent and reliable.

My long-term employment as an unskilled worker has instilled in me the discipline and commitment needed to manage my finances effectively. I am confident in my ability to utilize this loan to grow my business and contribute positively to the community.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further.
