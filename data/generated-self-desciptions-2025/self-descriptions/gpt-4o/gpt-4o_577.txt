I have a critical credit history due to previous loans, which are currently being managed responsibly. I am confident that my employment stability and consistent income will allow me to meet the installment rate of 2%.

I am recently separated and live with my two children, for whom I am the primary caregiver. We have been residing at our current address for 3 years and own a reliable car. My co-applicant, who is also my sister, is willing to assist with the repayment process.

I am committed to maintaining financial responsibility and believe that this loan will greatly improve our living conditions. I appreciate your consideration and am available for any further information you may require.
