**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,275 DM to support the expansion of my small consulting firm. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant for the past three years, during which I have honed my skills and built a reputable client base. My current financial situation is stable, with a checking account balance consistently over 200 DM and savings exceeding 1,000 DM. Although I have other credits, they are managed well and not with this bank.

The purpose of this loan is to purchase new equipment and hire additional staff to meet the growing demand for my services. I am confident that this expansion will lead to increased revenue, enabling me to repay the loan comfortably within the 24-month term.

I have been residing at my current address for four years and own my home. My credit history, while not perfect, reflects my commitment to meeting financial obligations. I believe this loan will help me achieve greater financial stability and success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
