Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,057 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at BioTech Labs for the past six years. My consistent employment history demonstrates my stability and reliability. 

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, and my savings are under 100 DM. However, I have a strong credit history, having paid back all existing credits on time. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I own a car, which adds to my asset base.

Since my divorce three years ago, I have been living independently in my current residence. I am committed to maintaining financial responsibility, as evidenced by my diligent handling of previous credits. I am confident that I can manage the installment rate of 3 DM per month comfortably.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further.
