**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 3,499 DM. As a scientific research assistant with three years of experience at a reputable lab, I have been committed to advancing my career and supporting my family. My current employment provides a stable income, which, combined with my co-applicant's support, ensures that I can manage the loan repayments responsibly.

My financial situation has been challenging, primarily due to unexpected medical expenses for my child, which affected my checking account balance. However, I have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility by maintaining my current residence for two years and managing two existing credits with your bank without issues.

Owning a new car is essential for my daily commute and will significantly enhance my ability to fulfill my professional responsibilities. I have no other installment plans, and my real estate property adds to my financial stability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to manage this loan and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
