**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,351 DM to purchase essential furniture for my home. I am currently employed as a resident assistant at a local care facility, where I have worked diligently for the past two years. My position, while unskilled, provides a stable income and has allowed me to maintain my financial obligations responsibly.

I have a strong credit history, having paid back all existing credits on time. My checking account balance is modest, but I have a building society savings agreement that provides additional financial security.

As a divorced mother of one, I am committed to providing a comfortable home environment for my child. I have lived in my current residence for four years and own my home, which reflects my stability and commitment to my community.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan over the requested 24-month period. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
