**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of $1,264. I have been employed as a warehouse associate for the past 8 years. During this time, I have gained significant experience in logistics and supply chain management, which has inspired me to start my own delivery service.

Although I currently have no checking or savings account, I have managed my finances responsibly and have an existing credit with another institution. My goal is to use the loan to purchase essential equipment for the business, which I believe will be profitable given the growing demand for reliable delivery services.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan on time. My consistent employment history and residence stability over the past 4 years demonstrate my commitment and reliability. I am also a responsible father to my dependent, ensuring that my financial decisions are sound and well-considered.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss it further.

Sincerely,
