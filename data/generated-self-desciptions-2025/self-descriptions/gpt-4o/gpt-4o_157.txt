**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,282 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. As a skilled employee working as a research assistant at a local university, I have been employed for the past three years. My current financial situation includes a checking account slightly below zero and a savings account with less than 100 DM. Despite this, I have consistently paid back all existing credits on time.

I am recently divorced and have been residing at my current address for four years. I own a reliable car, which is my only significant asset. My current housing situation involves renting, and I have no other debts or guarantors.

With a stable job and a good credit history, I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. The furniture and equipment I intend to purchase will improve my living conditions and support my work-from-home needs. I am committed to making timely repayments over the next 12 months, with an installment rate of 2.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller
