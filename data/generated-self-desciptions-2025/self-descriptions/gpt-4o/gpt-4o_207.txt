Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 10,623 DM to purchase a used vehicle. As a project manager at a reputable engineering firm, I have been steadily employed for the past eight years. My current role involves overseeing significant projects, which has honed my skills in financial management and responsibility.

Although I currently have a critical account and other existing credits, I am committed to improving my financial situation. I have been residing at my current address for four years and live rent-free, allowing me to focus on repaying debts efficiently. I have two dependents, which motivates me to secure reliable transportation for my family.

My credit history is admittedly less than ideal, but I have taken steps to rectify this by setting up a structured repayment plan. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate effectively.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss this further and demonstrate my commitment to fulfilling the loan terms.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
