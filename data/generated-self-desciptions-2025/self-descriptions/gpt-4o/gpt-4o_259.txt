Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,149 DM to purchase a new television and radio. As a skilled employee working as a scientific research assistant for the past two years, I have consistently demonstrated reliability and dedication in my role.

My financial situation is stable, although my checking account is currently below zero, and my savings are less than 100 DM. Despite this, I have maintained a good credit history with your bank, having duly paid back all previous credits. I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate of 4 DM.

As a divorced father, I reside with my child rent-free, which allows me to allocate more funds towards loan repayment. I have been living at my current residence for one year and have no other debts or guarantors.

I am committed to fulfilling all financial obligations and appreciate your consideration of my application. Thank you for your time and support.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

I am committed to responsibly managing this loan and appreciate your consideration. Thank you for your attention to my request.

Best regards,
