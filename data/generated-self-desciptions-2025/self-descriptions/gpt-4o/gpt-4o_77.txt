**Letter 1:**

Subject: Application for Car Loan

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,526 DM to purchase a used vehicle. I have been a project manager at a logistics company for the past eight years, a position that has provided me with stable income and a wealth of experience in managing complex operations. 

Currently, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, but I have consistently managed my finances responsibly over the years. I also maintain a small savings account. My credit history reflects some challenges, but I have always prioritized meeting my financial obligations, including two existing credits with your bank, which I have consistently paid on time.

The car is essential for my daily commute and to support my dependent son. My residence has been stable for the last four years, and I enjoy a housing arrangement that is free of charge, which allows me to allocate more resources toward loan repayment.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4% and assure you of my commitment to fulfilling this loan responsibly. Your consideration of my application is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
