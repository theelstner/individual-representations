Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,134 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a foreign worker employed as a scientific research assistant for the past three years, I rely heavily on personal transportation to commute to work and attend field research activities.

Although I do not currently have a checking account with your bank, I have maintained a savings account with a balance just below 100 DM. My credit history includes some challenges, but I have successfully managed other credits and am committed to improving my financial standing.

I have been residing at my current address for four years, demonstrating stability and commitment to my community. I am single, with no dependents, and have a steady income that allows me to comfortably manage the proposed installment rate.

I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling all financial obligations and believe my employment history and residence stability make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss this further and provide any additional information you may require.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
