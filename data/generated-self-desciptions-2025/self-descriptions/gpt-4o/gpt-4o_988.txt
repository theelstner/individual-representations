**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 6,289 DM to expand my small carpentry business. I have been working as a skilled craftsman for over eight years and recently transitioned to managing my own workshop. Although I have been in my current role for less than a year, my experience and dedication have allowed me to build a loyal customer base.

Currently, I have a checking account with a steady salary assignment for over a year, maintaining a balance of at least 200 DM. My credit history is impeccable, with all previous credits paid back on time. Though my savings are under 100 DM, I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance as additional security.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my business is growing steadily, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I have been residing in my own home for the past year, which provides stability for me and my child.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how this loan can contribute to the growth of my business.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
