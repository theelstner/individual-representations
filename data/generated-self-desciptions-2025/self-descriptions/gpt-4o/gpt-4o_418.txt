**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 2,579 DM. As a resident worker, I have been employed for the past 11 months at a local manufacturing company. Although my current position is unskilled, I have consistently demonstrated reliability and dedication, which is reflected in my steady income.

I am seeking this loan to purchase a new car, which is essential for commuting to work and managing daily responsibilities, especially as a single father of two. My credit history is strong; I have successfully repaid previous credits without delay. This history, coupled with my commitment to financial responsibility, makes me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

My current financial situation shows a checking account balance below zero, and my savings are limited to under 100 DM. However, I own my residence, which provides stability and reduces living expenses. With no other debts or installment plans, I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment rate of 4 DM monthly.

I appreciate your consideration and am hopeful for the opportunity to improve my family's transportation situation.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
