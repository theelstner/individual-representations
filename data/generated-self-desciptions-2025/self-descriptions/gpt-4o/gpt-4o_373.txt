Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of $6,070 to purchase a new television and radio system for my home. As a foreign worker currently residing in the country for four years, I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at the National Research Institute for the past eight years.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with a balance slightly below 100 DM. I have existing credit obligations, but I have always ensured timely payments. My credit history reflects some critical accounts, but I am committed to improving my financial standing.

I am single, without dependents, and have no other debtors or guarantors. I own a car, which serves as my property asset. My stable employment and residence underscore my reliability as a borrower. I am confident that my consistent income and responsible financial behavior make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
