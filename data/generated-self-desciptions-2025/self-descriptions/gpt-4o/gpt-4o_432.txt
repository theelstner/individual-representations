**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 3,448 DM to expand my small local grocery store. I have been running this store for the past four years and have seen steady growth in our customer base. As a resident worker with over five years of experience in the retail sector, I have developed a keen understanding of market demands.

Despite not having a checking account, I have diligently managed my finances and have a proven track record of paying back existing credits on time. My savings are limited, but I own real estate, which provides stability and security. My current residence of four years is also owned, minimizing my living expenses.

At 74 years old, I am committed to ensuring the success of my business, which supports my dependent, my grandson. I have no other debts or guarantors and am confident that the installment rate of 1 is manageable within my budget.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to continue contributing to the local economy and am confident in my ability to repay the loan.

Sincerely,
