Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,625 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute and responsibilities as a scientific research assistant. I have been employed at the Max Planck Institute for the past 8 years, where I have consistently demonstrated reliability and dedication.

Currently, I am facing a critical account status due to unforeseen medical expenses for my dependent child. However, I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance, which assure my financial stability in the long term. I am committed to managing my finances responsibly, as evidenced by my stable residence of 4 years and a consistent payment record for existing credits.

My guarantor, a reputable colleague at the institute, further supports my application. I am confident that my steady income and commitment to financial responsibility make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing this further.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
