**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2520 DM to purchase a new television. As an unskilled resident worker, I have been employed with Greenfield Manufacturing for the past three years. My current financial situation is stable, with a checking account balance just under 200 DM and savings close to 800 DM. Additionally, I hold a building society savings agreement.

While I have had some challenges in the past with credit, I have worked diligently to improve my financial standing. I currently manage two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing.

As a single father residing in my own home for the last two years, I have no other debts or guarantors and am committed to maintaining my financial responsibilities. I believe my consistent employment and efforts to manage my finances demonstrate my trustworthiness as a candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
