**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 760 DM to purchase a new television. As a divorced resident worker, I have been employed as a warehouse assistant for the past five years. My stable job has allowed me to maintain a good credit history, with all existing credits paid back duly.

Currently, my checking account balance is just under 200 DM, and my savings account is below 100 DM. However, I own my home, which provides additional security for my financial obligations. I have a guarantor who supports my application, further ensuring my commitment to repaying the loan.

I have been residing at my current address for two years, and I am a responsible individual, dedicated to providing for my 12-year-old son. As a foreign worker, I am committed to integrating and contributing positively to the community.

I assure you of my reliability and ability to meet the installment rate of 4, given my consistent employment and financial discipline. I look forward to your favorable consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
