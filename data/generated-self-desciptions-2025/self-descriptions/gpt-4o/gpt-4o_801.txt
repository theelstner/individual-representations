Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,549 DM to purchase a new car. I recently moved to this country for better opportunities and have been residing here for the past two years. Currently, I am in between jobs but actively seeking employment in the construction industry where I have significant experience.

Despite my current employment status, I have a strong track record of financial responsibility. My previous credit with your bank was paid back on time, demonstrating my commitment to meeting financial obligations.
