Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 14,421 DM to support the expansion of my small tech startup. As a software developer with three years of experience, I have identified a unique opportunity to develop a new app that addresses a niche market need.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, and my savings are under 100 DM, but my credit history is impeccable with all previous credits paid back duly. I have been consistently employed for the past three years at a reputable tech firm, which has helped me develop the skills necessary to ensure the success of my venture.

I am single, have no dependents, and own a car, which provides me with the flexibility and mobility to manage my business effectively. I have been residing at my current address for two years and have no other debtors or guarantors.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan over the 48-month term, given my stable income and clear financial track record. I look forward to discussing my application further.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
