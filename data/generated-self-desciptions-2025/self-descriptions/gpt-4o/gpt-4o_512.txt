Although my savings account is modest, I am confident in my ability to manage the loan installments, given my stable employment and consistent income.

I am a single parent and prioritize financial responsibility to support my dependent. I have no other debtors or guarantors and maintain no other installment plans. As a foreign worker, I have demonstrated my commitment to building a stable life here, and acquiring a car is a crucial step in continuing my professional development.
