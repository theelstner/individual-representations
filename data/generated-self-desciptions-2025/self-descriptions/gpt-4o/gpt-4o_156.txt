Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 6,967 DM to expand my current business. I have been successfully running a small import-export company for the past five years, specializing in sustainable goods. My business has shown steady growth, and I am looking to invest in new technology to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

I acknowledge that I have had a delay in paying off a previous credit. However, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management, including working with a financial advisor. My current checking account balance is modest, but I have a savings account with 250 DM, which I maintain for emergencies.

I have been residing at my current address for four years, and I own a car. My steady employment history and commitment to my business make me a trustworthy candidate. I am confident that with this loan, I can achieve significant growth and repay the loan within the agreed terms.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for any further information you may require.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
