Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3913 DM to purchase a radio and television. I have been employed as a scientific research assistant at BioTech Innovations for the past three years. My consistent salary assignments have been deposited into my checking account for over a year, maintaining a balance of at least 200 DM.

My credit history is strong, with all existing credits paid back duly. I currently have one other credit with your bank, which I have managed responsibly. I own my residence, which reflects my stability and commitment to financial obligations.

At 23, I am single with one dependent, and I manage my finances carefully. I have no other installment plans or debts, and my savings account balance is under 100 DM due to recent investments in my home.

I assure you of my trustworthiness and commitment to repaying the loan in a timely manner. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 2 DM, given my stable income and financial discipline.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.
