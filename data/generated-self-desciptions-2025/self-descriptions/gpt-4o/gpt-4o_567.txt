**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Emily Thompson, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,553 DM to purchase a new television. As a scientific research assistant with five years of experience at the University of Munich, I am committed to maintaining a stable and reliable income.

My financial situation is steady, with a small savings account and a modest checking account balance. While I have had delays in paying off debts in the past, I have since taken proactive steps to manage my finances more effectively, including setting up automated payments and budgeting monthly expenses.

I am currently divorced and living with my young daughter in a rented apartment where we have resided for the past two years. Although I have two existing credits with the bank, I have consistently made timely payments on both.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my stable employment and improved financial management. I have no other debts or guarantors, and I am committed to fulfilling my obligations to the bank.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to demonstrate my reliability as a borrower.

Sincerely,

Emily Thompson
