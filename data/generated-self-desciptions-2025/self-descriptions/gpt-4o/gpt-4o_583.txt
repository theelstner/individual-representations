Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,124 DM to purchase a new car. As a resident worker with three years at my current address, I find myself in need of reliable transportation to ensure punctuality and efficiency at work.

Although I have been in my current job for less than a year, my previous experience in a similar role has equipped me with the necessary skills to perform effectively. I am committed to maintaining a stable financial situation, despite my critical account history. The purchase of a car will significantly enhance my ability to meet work obligations and provide for my two dependents.

I own my home and have no other debtors or guarantors, which demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility. While I have other credits, I have consistently managed my installments and have property as collateral.

I assure you of my dedication to repaying the loan on time and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and support.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
