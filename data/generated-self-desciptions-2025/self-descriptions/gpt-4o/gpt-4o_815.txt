Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,051 DM to purchase essential domestic appliances for my home. Having been employed as a research assistant at the University of Munich for the past three years, I have a stable income and a solid employment history.

Currently, my checking account is slightly negative, and my savings account has less than 100 DM. Despite this, I have a strong credit history, having always paid back my previous credits on time.

I am confident in my ability to manage the loan repayments, thanks to my regular income and responsible financial habits. With no other debts or guarantors, and a reliable car as my property, I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling the loan obligations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
