**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of $8,858 to purchase a used vehicle. I am currently employed as a mechanical engineer at GreenTech Innovations, where I have worked for the past five years. My role involves overseeing project designs and ensuring efficient operations, which has allowed me to develop strong problem-solving skills and a keen attention to detail.

My financial situation includes existing credits, but I have maintained consistent payments and have never defaulted. Although I do not have a checking or savings account, I have a stable income and live rent-free, which significantly reduces my monthly expenses.

The car is essential for commuting to work and managing family responsibilities. As a single father with one dependent, reliable transportation is crucial for balancing professional and personal commitments.

I assure you of my reliability and commitment to fulfilling loan obligations. My long-term employment and stable housing situation further demonstrate my capability to manage this loan responsibly.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
John Smith
