**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,862 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a scientific research assistant at a reputable institution, I have been employed for over eight years. My current role is stable, and I have consistently received positive evaluations from my superiors.

I understand that my credit history shows a delay in payments in the past. This was due to an unexpected medical expense for my child, which has since been resolved. I have taken steps to ensure my financial management is robust moving forward.

My savings account currently holds 300 DM, and my expenses are minimal as I live rent-free with family. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4% and believe that acquiring a reliable vehicle will enhance my job performance and stability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to maintaining a strong financial relationship with your bank.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 2,862 DM to purchase a new car, which is essential for my daily commute. I have been working as an IT specialist for the past nine years and have established a steady career in this field.

While I have experienced delays in payment in the past, these were isolated incidents due to temporary financial constraints. I have since improved my budgeting skills and have maintained a checking account balance within the range of 150 DM.

Currently, I have 200 DM in my savings account, and my housing situation allows me to live cost-free. With no other debts, I am confident in my ability to repay this loan promptly.

Thank you for considering my request. I am eager to demonstrate my reliability and commitment to fulfilling this financial obligation.

Best regards,

Living rent-free with family has allowed me to focus on meeting my financial obligations, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I am confident that the installment rate of 4% is manageable within my current financial situation.
