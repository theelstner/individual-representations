**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 1,223 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a skilled mechanical engineer with over 8 years of experience at AutoTech Industries, I have a stable income and have consistently met all my financial obligations, including the repayment of two previous loans with your bank.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, but I have diligently managed my finances. My savings account is under 100 DM, which I plan to improve once my transportation needs are met. I am confident that a new car will enhance my ability to perform at work, ensuring continued job security and income stability.

Despite being divorced, I am committed to providing for my dependent child. I have no other debts or installment plans, and I have lived at my current residence for the past year. I am also a property owner, which further underscores my financial responsibility.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
