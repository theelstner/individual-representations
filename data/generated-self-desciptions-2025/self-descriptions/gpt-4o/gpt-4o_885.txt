Dear Sir/Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 1,098 DM to purchase a radio for my home. Music has always been a source of comfort and motivation for me, especially during challenging times. I am currently separated and living with my sister, who supports me as I transition back into the workforce.

Previously, I worked as a skilled assistant in a scientific research lab for 10 years. Unfortunately, due to funding cuts, I lost my position. I am actively applying for similar roles and have several promising leads.

While my credit history has been impacted by my recent unemployment, I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. I have been in my current residence for 4 years and have always maintained good standing with my previous creditors.

I would appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my reliability and commitment to repaying this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
