Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,494 DM. As a resident worker employed in the logistics sector for the past 10 months, I have been dedicated to my role and have consistently received positive feedback from my supervisors.

My financial situation is stable, with a checking account that has maintained a balance of over 200 DM for the past year. I have a solid credit history, having paid back my previous loans on time.
