Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,771 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at a local university, where I have worked diligently for the past five years. My role involves managing research projects and coordinating with various departments, which has honed my organizational and financial management skills.

As a divorced individual, I am solely responsible for my financial obligations and have no other debtors or guarantors. I have resided at my current address for two years and am committed to maintaining a stable living situation.

I assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan in a timely manner. My employment stability and responsible financial practices make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application.
