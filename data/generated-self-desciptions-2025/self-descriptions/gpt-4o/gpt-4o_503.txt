**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,493 DM to purchase a used car. As a dedicated scientific research assistant, I have been employed with the same reputable institution for over 8 years. My consistent employment history reflects my commitment and reliability.

Currently, my financial situation is stable, with all previous credits paid back on time.

The car is essential for commuting to work and managing family responsibilities, as I have two dependents. With no other debts or installment plans, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 2 DM per month.

I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling this financial obligation, as demonstrated by my credit history. I look forward to your positive response.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
