**Letter 1**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 590 DM to purchase a radio/television. I have been employed as a warehouse assistant for the past 10 months. Although my role is unskilled, I am dedicated and have consistently demonstrated reliability and hard work.

My current financial situation is stable. I have one existing credit with your bank, which I have been repaying diligently. My checking account balance is modest, but I manage my finances carefully. My savings account holds less than 100 DM, which I am actively working to increase.

I live in a home that I own, and I have resided there for the past three years with my wife and child. We have no other debts or installment plans, and I am confident in my ability to manage this new loan responsibly.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to maintaining my good credit standing and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
