Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,817 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant, a position I have held for three years. My work is stable and rewarding, and I am committed to advancing my career in this field.

As a 28-year-old divorced woman with one dependent, managing household expenses is crucial. I currently have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing. Despite not having a checking account, my financial responsibilities are managed diligently, and I have no other installment plans.

My residence has been my own for the past two years, and though I do not own property, I am committed to maintaining a stable living environment for my child. While my savings are minimal, my employment provides a reliable income to meet the installment rate of 4%.

I assure you of my dedication to meeting my financial obligations and hope you will consider my application favorably. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
