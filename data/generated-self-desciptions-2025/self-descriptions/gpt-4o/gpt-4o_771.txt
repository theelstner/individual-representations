Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,655 to purchase a new television for my home. As a long-time resident of [City], I have been employed as a groundskeeper for the local park district for over 8 years. My steady employment history demonstrates my reliability and commitment to my work.

Although I currently do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account and real estate property, which underscores my financial responsibility. My credit history includes a few critical accounts, but I have been diligent in managing them and ensuring all payments are made on time.

As a single father with one dependent, I am focused on providing a comfortable home environment, and a new television will enhance our family time. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 2, as my housing expenses are minimal due to owning my home.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan and appreciate your consideration.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
