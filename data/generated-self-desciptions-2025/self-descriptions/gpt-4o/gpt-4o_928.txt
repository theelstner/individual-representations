**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Anna Müller, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,049 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my apartment. I recently began working as a scientific research assistant at a local university, where I have been employed for the past 10 months. My role is stable, and I am confident in my ability to continue growing within this position.

Currently, my financial situation is challenging. I have a checking account with a negative balance and savings under 100 DM. I also have other credits with different banks, but I am committed to responsibly managing my finances and meeting all obligations. I have been residing at my current address for four years and pay rent regularly.

Despite my financial challenges, I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I have a building society savings agreement, which reflects my commitment to securing a stable financial future. I live with my young child, and this loan will greatly improve our living conditions by allowing us to purchase necessary items.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to demonstrate my reliability and responsibility in repaying this loan.

Sincerely,

Anna Müller
