Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,416 DM to purchase a radio and television. As a project manager in a leading technology firm, I have been employed for the past three years, and my career is stable and promising. 

Despite my current account balance being slightly negative, I have consistently paid back previous credits on time, demonstrating my commitment to fulfilling financial obligations. My savings account holds less than 100 DM, which is why I am seeking this loan to improve my living situation.

I own a car and have been residing at my current address for two years. My financial situation is supported by my steady income, and I have no other debts or guarantors. I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 3 DM per month.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

Dear Loan Officer,

I am reaching out to request a loan of 3,416 DM to purchase a new radio and television. As a self-employed marketing consultant with over two years in business, I have established a reliable client base and consistent income.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn, I have a solid credit history with all previous loans paid punctually. My savings are limited to under 100 DM, which necessitates this loan to enhance my home entertainment.

I own a car and have lived in my current residence for two years. My financial discipline is evident from my credit repayment history, and I have no other debts or guarantors. The installment rate of 3 DM monthly is manageable within my budget.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your approval.

Warm regards,  
[Your Name]
