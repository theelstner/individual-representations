**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 1,887 DM to expand my small enterprise, a local bakery that I have been running successfully for the past three years. As a skilled employee in the culinary industry, I have developed a unique range of products that have gained a loyal customer base.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, as I have reinvested most of my earnings into the business. I own real estate, which adds to my stability, and have been residing at my current address for four years. My credit history includes existing credits, but I have always met my obligations diligently.

This loan will enable me to purchase new equipment and enhance the bakery's offerings, ensuring continued growth. I am committed to maintaining a consistent installment rate of 4% and am confident in my ability to meet these payments.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to contributing positively to our community's economy.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
