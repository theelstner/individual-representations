**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,979 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. As a skilled employee working as a scientific research assistant for the past 5 years, I have consistently maintained a stable income and a commendable credit history, having paid back all previous credits duly.

Currently, my checking account balance is modest, as I have been focusing on covering living expenses and supporting my professional development. I do not have a savings account, but I have invested in a reliable car that serves as my primary asset.

I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 4% over the 48-month duration, given my steady employment and responsible financial behavior. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my residence stability supports my capability to meet this commitment.

Thank you for considering my application. I assure you of my dedication to fulfilling all obligations associated with this loan.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
