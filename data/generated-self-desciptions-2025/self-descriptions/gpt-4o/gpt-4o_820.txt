Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 15,857 DM. I am currently unemployed and seeking this loan to invest in a small online business venture. As a former manager with over 8 years of experience in the retail industry, I have a strong track record of managing finances and operations effectively. 

My checking account is currently below zero, and my savings are limited to under 100 DM.

I am confident that my business plan will generate sufficient revenue to cover the loan installments.

I have a co-applicant who is supportive and financially stable, which adds another layer of security to this loan application. My residence has been stable for the past three years, and I own a car that could serve as collateral if necessary.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to repaying the loan promptly and am open to discussing any terms that would facilitate this.

Sincerely,
