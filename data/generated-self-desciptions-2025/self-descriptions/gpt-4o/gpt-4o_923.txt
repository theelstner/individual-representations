Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 12,749 DM to purchase equipment for a small radio station I am establishing. As a foreign worker who has been employed as a broadcast technician for five years, I have gained significant expertise in the industry. My current position provides a stable income, and I have consistently demonstrated reliability and professionalism in my work.

While I have had delays in paying off credit in the past, I have since taken measures to improve my financial management, including opening a savings account with a balance nearing 1,000 DM. I have no other debts or guarantors, and my car is my primary asset.

I am committed to fulfilling the loan requirements and am confident that my experience and dedication make me a trustworthy candidate. I look forward to your favorable consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
