**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan to purchase a used car. As a skilled research assistant at the local university, I have been employed for the past 8 months. I am seeking a loan of $2,901 to facilitate my daily commute and manage family responsibilities more effectively.

Despite not having a checking account, I have consistently managed my finances and paid back existing credits on time. My credit history reflects my commitment to fulfilling financial obligations promptly. I have been residing at my current address for four years, and I own a piece of real estate, which underscores my stability and reliability.

Being a divorced mother of one, I am dedicated to providing the best for my child. I have no other debts or guarantors, which allows me to focus solely on this loan. My residence is rented, and I have been diligent in managing my expenses.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 1, and I assure you of my commitment to repaying the loan as agreed. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
