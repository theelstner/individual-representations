**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,114 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new home. I recently moved to the city to work as a scientific research assistant at BioTech Innovations. Although I have been with the company for just under a year, I have already contributed significantly to several projects, demonstrating my commitment and reliability.

As a single mother, I am dedicated to providing a stable and comfortable environment for my child. My current financial situation shows a checking account balance below zero, but this is due to the initial costs of setting up our home. I have a small savings account of less than 100 DM and a life insurance policy as part of my long-term financial planning.

I have always paid back any credits diligently and have no outstanding debts or other installment plans. With my stable employment and responsible financial history, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 1. I have resided in my current location for four years and have no other debts or guarantors.

I am hopeful that you will consider my application favorably. Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

Anna Fischer

**Letter 2:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 3,114 DM to purchase furniture and equipment necessary for my home office. I have been employed as a junior accountant at Global Finance Corp for nearly a year. This role has allowed me to hone my skills and contribute to the financial planning of the company.

As a married woman with one dependent, I am committed to ensuring a stable and comfortable home environment. Currently, my checking account is below zero, which is primarily due to the transition costs of moving and setting up our residence. My savings are modest, under 100 DM, but I have a building society savings agreement to support my future financial goals.

I have an impeccable credit history, having paid back any previous credits on time. I have no other debts or installment plans, and my residence has been stable for four years. With my steady employment and strong financial discipline, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan at the agreed installment rate.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,

Elena Schmidt
