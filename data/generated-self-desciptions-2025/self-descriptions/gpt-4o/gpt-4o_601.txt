### Letter 1

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of $3,863 to expand my small IT consulting firm. Over the past three years, I have been employed as a skilled network administrator at Tech Solutions Inc., where I have honed my technical skills and developed a strong understanding of business operations.

Two years ago, I started a consulting side business, which has seen steady growth. This loan will enable me to purchase essential equipment and hire additional staff to meet increasing client demands. While I had a delay in paying off a loan in the past, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management and have successfully managed my existing credit with your bank.

I live with a family member, which allows me to save on housing costs, and I have no other debts or installment plans. I am committed to using this loan responsibly and am confident in my ability to repay it on time, given the projected growth of my business.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further.

Sincerely,
John Smith
