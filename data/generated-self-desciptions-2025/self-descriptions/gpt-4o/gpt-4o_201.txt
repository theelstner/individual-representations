Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 4,297 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my home office. As a senior project manager at a reputable engineering firm, where I have been employed for over 8 years, I am seeking to create a more efficient workspace to enhance my productivity.

Although I have faced challenges with delayed payments in the past, I have taken significant steps to improve my financial management. My current checking account balance is 150 DM, and while my savings are modest, I have consistently met my financial obligations over the last few years.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan within the 18-month term, given my stable employment and steady income. I believe that this investment in my home office will not only benefit my work performance but also improve my overall financial situation.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to maintaining a positive relationship with your bank and look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
