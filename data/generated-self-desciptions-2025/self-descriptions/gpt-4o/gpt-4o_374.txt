**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2146 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. As a skilled research assistant at the University of Munich, I have been employed for the past 10 months, and my work involves supporting scientific studies that contribute to important academic advancements.

Currently, I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly. Although I do not have a checking account, I am committed to maintaining financial discipline. My credit history includes a critical account, but I have taken significant steps to improve my financial standing.

As a divorced mother of one, I understand the importance of financial stability for my family. I reside in a rented apartment and own a piece of real estate, which adds to my financial security. Despite not having a telephone, I am reachable via email and have a stable residence for the past three years.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan, as my employment provides a steady income. I appreciate your consideration of my application and am eager to discuss any further details.

Sincerely,
Anna Müller
