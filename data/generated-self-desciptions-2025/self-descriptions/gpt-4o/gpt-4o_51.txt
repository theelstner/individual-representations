**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2073 DM to purchase a new television for my home. I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at GreenTech Innovations, where I have been working for the past three years. My role involves assisting in groundbreaking environmental studies, and I am proud to contribute to such important work.

As a divorced mother of one, I am dedicated to providing a comfortable and enriching environment for my child. Our current television is outdated, and upgrading it would allow us to access educational content and stay informed about global developments.

I have a strong credit history, having paid back all existing credits on time. Additionally, I own real estate, which I believe demonstrates my stability and commitment to financial responsibility. While I do not have a checking account, I maintain a savings account with a balance of just under 500 DM.

My co-applicant, who is a trusted family member, will support my application, ensuring that the loan is managed effectively. I have lived in my current residence for two years, and I have no other installment plans.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
