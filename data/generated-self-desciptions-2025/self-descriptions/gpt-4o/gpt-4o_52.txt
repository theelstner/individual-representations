Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,333 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. As a resident worker at a local manufacturing plant, I have been employed for just under a year. My position, while unskilled, provides a stable income that allows me to meet my financial obligations.

I currently have a checking account with a small balance and a prior credit history that includes a delay in payments. However, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management skills. I am confident in my ability to make timely payments on this loan, as evidenced by my consistent payment history over the past year.

My current residence, which I have occupied for two years, is owned. Additionally, I hold a building society savings agreement and life insurance, which further demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility.

While I am single and have no guarantors, I do support one dependent. I have one existing credit at this bank and am dedicated to maintaining a positive relationship with your institution.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how I can meet the bank’s requirements and secure this loan.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
