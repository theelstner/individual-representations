**Letter 1: Management Professional**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,249 DM to purchase a new car. As a management professional with over five years of experience at a reputable logistics company, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to manage both personal and professional finances effectively.

My current financial situation includes a checking account balance below 0 DM and savings under 100 DM. However, I have maintained a strong credit history by duly repaying all existing credits. With a stable income and no other debts or guarantors, I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed installment plan.

Having resided in my current location for four years without housing costs, I can allocate more resources towards this loan. My employment stability and reliable credit history make me a trustworthy candidate. Acquiring this car will enhance my mobility, further supporting my professional commitments and family responsibilities.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
