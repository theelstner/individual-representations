**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,503 DM to purchase a used car. As a skilled employee working as a technical specialist in a manufacturing firm for the past three years, reliable transportation is crucial for my job. My current employment is stable, and I have been with the company since 2020.

While I have faced delays in paying off debts in the past, I have taken significant steps to improve my financial management skills. I am committed to maintaining timely payments and have no other installment plans or debts aside from one existing credit with your bank.

I currently reside in a rental property with my wife and child, and we have lived there for four years. We own a piece of real estate, which adds to our financial stability. Although I do not have a checking account, my savings are limited to less than 100 DM, making this loan essential for my family’s needs.

I believe my consistent employment and property ownership demonstrate my reliability as a candidate. I am confident in my ability to manage this loan responsibly.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
