Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 709 DM to purchase a new television. I have been a resident worker for over eight years at a local manufacturing plant, where I have demonstrated reliability and consistency in my work. My current financial situation is stable, although my checking account is slightly overdrawn due to unexpected expenses related to my dependent son's education.

I have a history of responsibly managing my debts, as evidenced by my timely payments on existing credits. Although my savings are modest, I have invested in real estate, which provides me with a strong asset base. My current residence of four years is owned, which further solidifies my financial stability.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan within the specified installment rate, given my steady income and prudent budgeting. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
