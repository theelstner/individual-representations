**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 5,150 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my new apartment. I recently relocated for my job as a scientific research assistant, where I have been employed for the past eight years. My current financial situation is stable, with my primary expenses covered, but I lack the upfront capital needed for these purchases.

Although I don't have a checking account, I have maintained a critical account with another bank and have a reliable credit history. My savings are modest, with less than 100 DM, due to recent moving expenses. I have no other debtors or guarantors and have been residing at my current address for four years.

As a skilled employee, I am committed to my career and have a steady income. I believe my long-term employment and consistent payment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I am confident that I will be able to manage the installment rate of 4% comfortably.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

**Letter 2:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 5,150 DM to purchase necessary furniture and equipment for my home. I have been working as a logistics coordinator for the past seven years and have a stable income that supports my living expenses.

Although I do not have a checking account, my credit history is solid, with existing credits managed through another bank. My savings are minimal, under 100 DM, as I have been focusing on paying off previous debts. I own a car, which represents a significant asset in my name.

I am single, with no dependents, and have been residing at my current address for four years. I have no other guarantors or installment plans, which allows me to focus solely on this loan.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4% due to my consistent employment and financial discipline. I assure you that I am a responsible borrower who will honor the loan terms.

Thank you for considering my application. I hope to hear from you soon.

Warm regards,
