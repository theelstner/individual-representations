**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,872 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment. As a self-employed graphic designer, I have been working independently for the past eight years. Recently, I have faced challenges due to the economic downturn, which has impacted my savings and resulted in a temporary negative balance in my checking account.

Despite these setbacks, I have secured a promising contract with a local marketing firm, which will commence in two months. This opportunity will significantly improve my financial situation and enable me to repay the loan comfortably.

I understand my credit history is critical, but I have taken steps to manage my existing debts responsibly. I have been residing at my current address for four years, and my housing costs are minimal as I live rent-free. This stability, coupled with my commitment to fulfill my financial obligations, makes me a trustworthy candidate for the loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to repay the loan and appreciate your support.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
