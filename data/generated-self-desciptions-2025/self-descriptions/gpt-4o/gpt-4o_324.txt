**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2,910 DM to purchase a used vehicle. As a project manager in a leading tech company, I have been employed for the past 5 years and have consistently demonstrated financial responsibility. My existing credit history is flawless, with all previous credits paid back on time.

Currently, my checking account is slightly below zero due to recent unexpected medical expenses for my son. However, I have always managed my finances diligently and have no other debts or guarantors. My savings are modest, but I am committed to maintaining a stable financial situation.

A vehicle is essential for my daily commute and responsibilities, and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan in the stipulated 24-month period. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 2,910 DM to purchase a used car. I have been serving as a senior analyst in a financial firm for 6 years. During this time, I have maintained an impeccable credit record, with all credits paid promptly.

Although my checking account is currently below zero, this is a temporary situation due to a recent relocation for work. I have lived at my current residence for a year, and I enjoy rent-free housing as part of my employment benefits.

This vehicle will greatly enhance my efficiency and enable me to fulfill my professional commitments. I assure you of my dedication to repaying the loan within the agreed timeline.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
