**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,149 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. My name is David Müller, and I am currently employed as a scientific research assistant at BioTech Innovations, where I have been working for the past 10 months. Despite being relatively new to this position, I have quickly established myself as a reliable and dedicated employee.

My financial situation is currently stable, with all existing credits paid back duly. However, my checking account is slightly overdrawn, and my savings are under 100 DM. This loan would greatly assist me in furnishing my apartment, as I currently reside for free with a family member.

I am committed to managing my finances responsibly and have a history of timely repayments. My installment rate is manageable, and I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment schedule. As a foreign worker, I am determined to build a strong financial foundation here.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to demonstrate my trustworthiness as a borrower.

Sincerely,

David Müller

My name is Carlos Fernandez, and I have been employed as a junior software developer at Tech Solutions for the past 11 months.
