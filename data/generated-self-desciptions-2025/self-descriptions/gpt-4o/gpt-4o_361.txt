**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2406 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my residence. As a scientific research assistant with over five years of experience at a reputable institution, I have consistently demonstrated responsibility and commitment in my role. 

Despite my current checking account balance being below zero, I have a solid credit history, having always repaid my previous credits diligently. I believe this reflects my reliability and financial discipline. My savings account balance is currently under 100 DM, but this is due to recent unexpected expenses related to my child's education.

I am a 23-year-old divorced mother with one dependent, residing in my current apartment for the past four years. Although I rent my home, I have invested in a small piece of real estate, which adds to my financial stability. 

I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 4 DM, given my steady income and prudent budgeting. I have no other debts or installment plans, ensuring that my focus remains on repaying this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am committed to maintaining my excellent repayment record and appreciate your support in helping me furnish my home adequately.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
