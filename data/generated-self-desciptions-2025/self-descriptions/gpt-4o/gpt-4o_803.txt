**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,795 DM to purchase a new television. I have been employed as a customer service representative at a local retail store for the past eight years. Although my job is unskilled, I have consistently demonstrated reliability and dedication, earning the trust of my employer and colleagues.

Currently, my financial situation is stable but tight. My checking account balance is modest, and I have limited savings. I am divorced with one dependent, and I have been living in my current rented residence for four years. I do have existing credit obligations, but they are well-managed with the support of a guarantor.

I understand my credit history shows some challenges, but I am committed to improving my financial standing. The requested loan will allow me to replace an essential appliance, contributing to my family's well-being. I believe my consistent employment and responsible handling of existing credits make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to demonstrate my commitment to meeting the repayment terms.

Sincerely,
