**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 2002 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a scientific research assistant with six years of experience at the University of Frankfurt, I rely heavily on reliable transportation to commute to work and manage my daily responsibilities, including supporting my two young dependents.

My financial situation is stable, with a consistent employment history and a spotless credit record. I have diligently paid off previous credits and currently have a modest savings account. Although my checking account balance is below 200 DM, my salary is consistent, and I have a life insurance policy that adds to my financial security.

I have lived at my current residence for four years and have no other debts or installment plans. As a single male, I am solely responsible for my financial obligations and have a clear plan to manage this loan within the 12-month term.

I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 3, and I assure you that my payment history reflects my commitment to fulfilling my financial responsibilities.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
