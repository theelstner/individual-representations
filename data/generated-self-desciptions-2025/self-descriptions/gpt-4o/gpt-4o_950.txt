**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,533 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home. As a recent resident in this country, I have been steadily working to establish my financial standing. Although I do not have a checking account, I have a life insurance policy that demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility.

For the past 10 months, I have been employed as a warehouse associate at a local distribution center. My reliable work ethic has allowed me to maintain a stable income, and I have consistently paid back my existing credits on time. My wife and I have two children, and we recently moved into our own home, which is why we require additional furniture and equipment.

I have a co-applicant for this loan, ensuring that we have a strong support system to meet our financial obligations. I am committed to the installment rate of 4% and am confident in my ability to repay this loan in a timely manner.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to further discuss my situation and demonstrate my trustworthiness as a candidate.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
