Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,516 DM to purchase a new television. My name is Maria Lopez, and I have been a resident of our community for the past year. I am a 43-year-old divorced mother with one dependent, and I have been employed as a resident assistant for the past three years.

I have been living at my current residence for a year and have no other installment plans. While I do not have a telephone, I am committed to maintaining clear communication through other means.

As a foreign worker, I have always prioritized financial responsibility and stability. I believe this loan will enhance my quality of life, and I am confident in my ability to repay it on time.

Sincerely,
Maria Lopez
