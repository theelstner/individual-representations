Subject: Business Loan Application

Dear [Bank Manager's Name],

I am writing to apply for a business loan of 8,318 DM to expand my small business, "Evelyn's Organic Bakery." I have been successfully self-employed for over eight years, and my bakery has become a cherished part of our community. 

My financial situation is stable; I have always paid back any credits duly and have no other debts or installment plans. My checking account balance is typically between 0 and 200 DM, and while my savings are less than 100 DM, my business generates consistent revenue.

I have been living in my current residence for four years, rent-free, which allows me to allocate more resources to my business. At 42, with one dependent, I am committed to ensuring a secure financial future for my family. 

As a responsible borrower with a solid credit history, I am confident in my ability to manage the loan effectively. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to discussing this opportunity further.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Evelyn Schmidt
