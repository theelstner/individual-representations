**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,246 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a 23-year-old resident worker, I recently started my current job less than a year ago. Though my employment is recent, I have consistently demonstrated reliability and dedication in my role.

My financial history reflects responsible credit management, as I have always paid back my existing credits on time. I currently have a small amount in savings, less than 100 DM, but I own my residence and have real estate property, which adds to my financial stability.

I am single, with one dependent, and have been residing in my current location for two years. Although I do not have a telephone, I am easily reachable through other means and have no other debtors or guarantors.

I believe I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan due to my solid credit history and responsible financial management. The car will greatly enhance my ability to commute to work and fulfill my responsibilities.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss any further details you may require.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
