**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,533 DM to purchase a new television. As a skilled employee working as a customer service representative at a local electronics store, I have been employed for the past ten months. Despite the short duration, I have proven my reliability and commitment to my role, earning commendations from my supervisors for excellent service.

Although I do not have a checking account, I have maintained a savings account with minimal funds. My credit history is strong, with all previous credits paid back on time. I currently have no other debts or guarantors, and I own a car, which adds to my financial stability.

I reside in my current home with my husband and our child, managing household expenses responsibly. While I have been in my present residence for three years, I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4 DM, thanks to my steady income and disciplined financial management.

As a foreign worker, I am committed to building a stable future for my family in this community. I assure you of my trustworthiness and dedication to fulfilling this loan agreement.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
