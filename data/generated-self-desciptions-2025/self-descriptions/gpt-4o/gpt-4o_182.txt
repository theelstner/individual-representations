Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a business loan of $9,572. As a software developer with eight years of experience, I recently transitioned to freelance work and am in the process of launching a tech consultancy. This loan will help cover startup costs, including purchasing necessary equipment and marketing services.

Although I had delays in payments in the past, I have since taken steps to improve my financial management, including setting up automatic payments and consulting with a financial advisor. I have been steadily employed for the past 11 months and have a reliable income stream from my freelance projects.

I have no other debts or guarantors, and my car is my only property. I have been living in my current residence for a year and am committed to maintaining a stable financial situation. I believe my dedication to improving my creditworthiness and my solid business plan make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss it further.

Sincerely,
