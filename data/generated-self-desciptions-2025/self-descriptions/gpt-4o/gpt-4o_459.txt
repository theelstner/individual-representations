**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan in the amount of 3,386 DM. As a scientific research assistant at the University of Berlin, I have been employed in my current position for over eight years. This stable employment has allowed me to establish a solid credit history, with all previous credits paid back on time.

Currently, my checking account balance is below zero, primarily due to unforeseen medical expenses for my dependent. However, my consistent income and housing situation, where I live rent-free, enable me to manage the proposed installment rate comfortably.

Acquiring a used car will significantly enhance my ability to commute efficiently, thereby supporting my continued contribution to important research projects. I am confident in my ability to meet the loan obligations and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
