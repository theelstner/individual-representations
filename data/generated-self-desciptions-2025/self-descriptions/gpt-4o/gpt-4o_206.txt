Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 1,495 DM to purchase a new vehicle. As a construction worker with over 8 years of experience, I rely heavily on personal transportation to commute to various job sites. My current vehicle is no longer reliable, and a new car will ensure I can maintain my employment and support my two children.

Despite a critical account in my credit history, I have maintained stable employment and own real estate, which underscores my commitment to financial responsibility. I have been residing at my current address for a year and have no other installment plans, ensuring my focus on fulfilling this loan obligation.

I am confident in my ability to manage this loan, given my stable income and the absence of other debtors or guarantors. I appreciate your consideration and am eager to discuss this application further.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
