**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a car loan of 4,006 DM to purchase a new vehicle. I have been employed as a warehouse associate at Berlin Logistics for the past three years. My job requires reliable transportation, and my current vehicle is no longer dependable.

Despite a checking account balance below zero, I have consistently managed my existing credits and paid them back duly. This demonstrates my commitment to fulfilling financial obligations. My credit history is strong, and I have never missed a payment.

I currently have less than 100 DM in savings, but I am confident in my ability to manage the installment rate of 3 DM due to my steady income. I have been residing at my current address for two years and have no other debtors or guarantors, which simplifies my financial situation.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how I can meet the bank’s requirements and move forward with this loan.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
