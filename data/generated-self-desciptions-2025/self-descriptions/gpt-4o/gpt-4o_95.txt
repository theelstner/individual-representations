**Letter 1:**

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 3,617 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my apartment. I have been working as a scientific research assistant at a reputable institute for over 8 years. My salary has been consistently deposited into my checking account with your bank for the past year, and I have maintained a balance exceeding 200 DM during this time.

Although my credit history shows some existing obligations, I am committed to managing my finances responsibly. I currently have two credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing, and I have never missed an installment.

I am confident in my ability to repay this loan due to my stable employment and additional income from freelance consulting work. My co-applicant, who is my sibling, also has a steady job and will assist in ensuring timely payments.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to furnish my home to create a more comfortable environment for myself and my dependent.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
