I am writing to express my interest in applying for a bank loan of 1048 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. As a 23-year-old single male, I have been a resident of this city for 4 years and have been working as an unskilled laborer for the past 2 years. Despite my limited income, I have managed to own my home and have a decent credit history, having paid back all my previous credits at this bank duly. My current checking account has been open for 10 months with a balance of 150 DM, and I also have a small savings account with 50 DM. I have one dependent, my younger brother, who I support financially. I am confident that I can repay the loan in 4 installments and I am willing to provide any additional information necessary to facilitate my application. I believe that I am a trustworthy candidate and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application with you. Thank you for considering my request.
