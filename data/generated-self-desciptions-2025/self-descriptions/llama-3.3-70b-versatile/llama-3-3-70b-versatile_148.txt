I am a 39-year-old divorced female and I am writing to express my interest in applying for a bank loan of 860 DM to purchase a new car. As a scientific research assistant with over 8 years of experience, I have a stable income and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan. I have been living in my current residence for 4 years and I own my home, which provides me with a sense of security and stability. Although my credit history is critical due to existing credits at other banks, I am committed to making timely payments and improving my credit score. I have a checking account with your bank for 6 months, but unfortunately, it has a balance of less than 0 DM. I am a responsible individual with only one dependent, my child, and I am registered as a foreign worker under my own name. I am eager to demonstrate my trustworthiness and I am willing to work with your bank to establish a repayment plan that suits my financial situation. I would be grateful if you could consider my loan application. Thank you for your time and consideration.
