I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 1217 DM to purchase domestic appliances for my family and me. As a 47-year-old married man with one dependent, I have been a resident in this area for 3 years and have been working as an unskilled resident for a company for the past 2 years. Despite my limited work experience in this field, I have a good credit history, having paid back all my existing credits duly till now. I have a real estate property and have been living in my own house, which I believe demonstrates my ability to manage my finances responsibly. I have a checking account with your bank, which has been active for 18 months, although the current balance is below 0 DM. I am confident that with this loan, I will be able to improve my family's living situation and make timely payments, as I have no other installment plans or debtors. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application with you.

Sincerely, 
Hans Müller
