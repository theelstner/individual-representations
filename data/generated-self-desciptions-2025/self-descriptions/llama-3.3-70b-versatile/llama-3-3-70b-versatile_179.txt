I am a 35-year-old scientific research assistant and I am writing to express my interest in obtaining a bank loan of 338 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. Despite having a critical credit history and existing credits at other banks, I am confident in my ability to repay the loan due to my stable employment of 8 years at a reputable research institution. My current financial situation is manageable, with a savings account of 750 DM and other bonds totaling 200 DM. I have been residing at my current address for 4 years and own a car, which I believe demonstrates my commitment to financial responsibility. I am a trustworthy candidate and I am willing to commit to an installment rate of 4, which I believe is reasonable given my income and expenses. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application with you further.

Sincerely, 
Thomas
