I am a 32-year-old single male and I have been working as a scientific research assistant for the past 8 months at a reputable institution. I am applying for a bank loan of 8072 to start my own business, a small laboratory equipment supply company.

I am confident that I will be able to pay back the loan in installments of 25 per month. I would like to thank you for considering my application and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my proposal in more detail. Sincerely, Thomas
