I am a 27-year-old female, divorced, and a resident of this city for the past 4 years, writing to apply for a bank loan of 3643 DM to purchase essential furniture and equipment for my home.

I have a checking account with your bank, which has been active for 15 months, and I am committed to making timely payments. I have a building society savings agreement and life insurance, which demonstrates my ability to plan for the future. I am a trustworthy candidate, and I assure you that I will make regular installment payments. I am confident that with this loan, I will be able to improve my living situation and provide a better life for my 1 dependent. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application with you. Thank you for considering my request.
