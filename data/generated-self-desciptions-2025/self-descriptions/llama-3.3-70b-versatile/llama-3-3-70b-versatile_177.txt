I am writing to apply for a bank loan to purchase a used car as I have recently become unemployed after working as a scientific research assistant for 8 years at a reputable institution. Despite my current employment status my credit history with this bank is impeccable with all previous credits paid back on time. I have been a resident at my current address for 1 month and I own the property which I believe demonstrates my ability to manage my finances effectively. I have a dependent child to care for and I am confident that with this loan I will be able to secure a stable means of transportation to support my family. I am a 53 year old divorced woman and I am committed to making timely payments of 4 installments per month. I would like to assure you that I am a trustworthy candidate and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further. Thank you for considering my loan application.
