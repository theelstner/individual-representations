My current checking account balance is 150 DM and I have a small savings account with 80 DM. I own my home and have a stable residence, which I believe makes me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I have two dependents and I am eager to provide them with a better living situation, which is why I am applying for this loan. I am committed to making timely payments and I am willing to work with the bank to establish a payment plan that suits my financial situation. Thank you for considering my application.
