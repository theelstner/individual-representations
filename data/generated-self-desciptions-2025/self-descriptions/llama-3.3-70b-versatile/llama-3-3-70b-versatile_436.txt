I am writing to apply for a bank loan of 2136 DM to purchase furniture and equipment for my new home I recently bought as a real estate property where I have been living for 2 years now. As a 25-year-old single male and a skilled employee working as a scientific research assistant for the past 3 years I have a stable income that allows me to pay back the loan in installments. My credit history is clean and I have duly paid back all my existing credits. I have been a customer of this bank for 9 months and have a checking account with a balance of less than 0 DM and a savings account with less than 100 DM. I am a trustworthy candidate and I am confident that I will be able to pay back the loan in the agreed upon installment rate of 3. I have one dependent and I am a foreign worker but I have a stable job and a steady income. I am looking forward to the opportunity to work with you and I am confident that I will be able to pay back the loan. Thank you for considering my application.
