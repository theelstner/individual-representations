{"id":0,"text":"Letter 1  \nBerlin, 18 September 2025  \n\nDear Loan Officer,  \n\nMy name is Miguel Ramírez, a 35-year-old Spanish aircraft-maintenance supervisor employed at Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH for the past eight years. I respectfully request a loan of €976 to purchase a combined radio-television receiver that will allow my eight-year-old son to follow German language learning programs from home.  \n\nMy net monthly income is €3 050 after taxes. I own a small row house in Neukölln and a 2016 Opel Astra, both fully insured. Although I do not keep a checking account, my salary is transferred to a prepaid payroll card issued by my employer, and I pay all expenses electronically. I have two earlier instalment loans with your bank—one for kitchen appliances (repaid last year) and one current renovation loan whose monthly instalment of €78 has never been late. Apart from that, I have no other debt or guarantees outstanding.  \n\nWith a stable, union-protected job and eight years of uninterrupted employment, I am confident that I can meet the proposed €41 monthly instalment over the 12-month term. I value the relationship I have built with your institution and look forward to strengthening it further.  \n\nThank you for your consideration. I am available for any additional information you may require.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMiguel Ramírez","model":"o3","letter_id":"1","profile_id":"805","entities":[{"id":63337,"label":"new_name","start_offset":73,"end_offset":87},{"id":63338,"label":"GCD_age","start_offset":91,"end_offset":102},{"id":63339,"label":"new_nationality","start_offset":103,"end_offset":110},{"id":63340,"label":"GCD_job","start_offset":111,"end_offset":188},{"id":63343,"label":"GCD_present_employment_since","start_offset":189,"end_offset":213},{"id":63345,"label":"GCD_credit_amount","start_offset":248,"end_offset":252},{"id":63347,"label":"specification","start_offset":267,"end_offset":301},{"id":63348,"label":"new_loan_purpose_reason","start_offset":302,"end_offset":393},{"id":63350,"label":"aspect","start_offset":321,"end_offset":335},{"id":63341,"label":"aspect","start_offset":111,"end_offset":142},{"id":63342,"label":"aspect","start_offset":143,"end_offset":188},{"id":63344,"label":"specification","start_offset":189,"end_offset":213},{"id":63346,"label":"GCD_purpose","start_offset":256,"end_offset":301},{"id":63349,"label":"GCD_dependents","start_offset":318,"end_offset":339},{"id":63351,"label":"aspect","start_offset":336,"end_offset":339},{"id":63352,"label":"new_income","start_offset":398,"end_offset":441},{"id":63353,"label":"GCD_property","start_offset":443,"end_offset":521},{"id":63354,"label":"aspect","start_offset":451,"end_offset":456},{"id":63355,"label":"specification","start_offset":457,"end_offset":466},{"id":63356,"label":"aspect","start_offset":467,"end_offset":478},{"id":63358,"label":"aspect","start_offset":485,"end_offset":489},{"id":63359,"label":"aspect","start_offset":502,"end_offset":520},{"id":63362,"label":"GCD_status_of_existing_checking_account","start_offset":522,"end_offset":677},{"id":63363,"label":"aspect","start_offset":522,"end_offset":563},{"id":63364,"label":"aspect","start_offset":565,"end_offset":615},{"id":63365,"label":"aspect","start_offset":616,"end_offset":637},{"id":63366,"label":"aspect","start_offset":643,"end_offset":676},{"id":63368,"label":"GCD_number_of_existing_credits_at_this_bank","start_offset":678,"end_offset":859},{"id":63369,"label":"aspect","start_offset":685,"end_offset":728},{"id":63371,"label":"aspect","start_offset":756,"end_offset":774},{"id":63370,"label":"aspect","start_offset":729,"end_offset":755},{"id":63372,"label":"aspect","start_offset":779,"end_offset":806},{"id":63374,"label":"aspect","start_offset":807,"end_offset":838},{"id":63375,"label":"aspect","start_offset":839,"end_offset":858},{"id":63376,"label":"GCD_other_installment_plans","start_offset":877,"end_offset":924},{"id":63377,"label":"GCD_job","start_offset":928,"end_offset":962},{"id":63378,"label":"GCD_present_employment_since","start_offset":967,"end_offset":1006},{"id":63379,"label":"aspect","start_offset":933,"end_offset":941},{"id":63380,"label":"aspect","start_offset":943,"end_offset":962},{"id":63382,"label":"GCD_installment_rate","start_offset":1008,"end_offset":1074},{"id":63383,"label":"GCD_duration_in_month","start_offset":1075,"end_offset":1097},{"id":63384,"label":"aspect","start_offset":490,"end_offset":500}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5,"text":"Letter 1 – Mr. Luis Ortega, Satellite-TV Technician  \nDear Loan Officer,  \nI am requesting 1 478 DM to replace the tools that were stolen from my van last month. Without them I cannot align satellite dishes and my income has dropped 40 %. For the past 2 years and 9 months I have been employed by AstraSat GmbH; my net pay is 1 850 DM and my wife brings home 650 DM from her part-time cleaning job. We own our small row-house in Dortmund-Brackel (mortgage 430 DM\/month) and have no other debts except the ongoing car loan with your bank. Although I had a 30-day delay on that loan in 2022, I have since paid every installment on the 4th of each month.

{"id":16,"text":"Letter 1  \n5 June 2025  \n\nTo the Credit Committee,  \n\nMy name is Gabriela Santos, a 37-year-old Portuguese citizen working in Düsseldorf since March 2020 as a customs officer at the North Rhine-Westphalia Finance Directorate. I earn a net salary of 2 780 € per month and hold a lifetime civil-service contract.  \n\nI request a 3 380 € loan over four months to buy a new Volkswagen Polo that will replace my fifteen-year-old car, whose repairs now exceed its value. Reliable transportation is essential for the eighty-kilometre round trip between my home and the customs depot where I work rotating shifts.  \n\nAlthough I do not yet maintain a current account with your bank, I have one small furniture loan (612 € balance) with Hanseatic Finance that has been serviced punctually since 2022. My mortgage on the condominium I own in Ratingen is up to date; monthly instalments of 430 € are automatically debited from my salary. With two school-age sons and no guarantor, I keep expenses under tight control. After taxes, mortgage, child support from my former spouse and household costs, I still retain an average disposable surplus of 780 € per month, more than enough to cover the projected instalment of about 860 € for four months.  \n\nI understand that my past move from Portugal to Germany in 2021 caused a brief delay in forwarding one credit statement, which led to a “critical” note on my Schufa file. Since then every payment has been on time, and I have attached three years of payslips and the current land-registry extract for my apartment as proof of stability and collateral.  \n\nI look forward to building a long-term relationship with your bank and will gladly open my salary account with you should this application be approved. Thank you for considering my request.  \n\nKind regards,  \nGabriela

I reside in my own home, which I’ve occupied for 4 years, and have one dependent, my 9-year-old son.  \n\nAs a foreign worker from Nigeria, I take pride in my stability and responsibility.

{"id":39,"text":"Letter 2  \nMurat Aydin  \n14 May 2025  \n\nDear Sir or Madam,\n\nI wish to obtain a 2,333 DM loan to buy a smart TV-radio unit for my home office. As an independent tax consultant, reliable access to financial news channels is essential for the reports I prepare for clients.\n\nI have lived in Germany since 2012 and have run my licensed practice in Mannheim for the last nine years. Annual after-tax earnings average 93,000 DM; monthly disposable income exceeds 4,500 DM. My savings account with you currently holds 640 DM, and I drive a fully paid VW Passat. I do not maintain a checking account, preferring to manage cash flow through my business account at the tax chamber.\n\nTwo years ago I borrowed 8,000 DM from your bank for office furniture. That loan was repaid six months early. I have no other liabilities, and my mortgage-free townhouse ensures stable housing costs. The requested installment rate of 4% equals roughly 95 DM per month—well within my budget.\n\nMy proven repayment discipline and long professional standing make me a low-risk applicant. I appreciate your favorable assessment.\n\nKind regards,  \nMurat Aydin","model":"o3","letter_id":"2","profile_id":"42","entities":[{"id":63741,"label":"GCD_credit_amount","start_offset":79,"end_offset":87},{"id":63742,"label":"GCD_purpose","start_offset":102,"end_offset":140},{"id":63743,"label":"aspect","start_offset":102,"end_offset":107},{"id":63744,"label":"aspect","start_offset":122,"end_offset":140},{"id":63745,"label":"new_name","start_offset":1114,"end_offset":1125},{"id":63746,"label":"GCD_job","start_offset":142,"end_offset":174},{"id":63747,"label":"aspect","start_offset":148,"end_offset":159},{"id":63748,"label":"specification","start_offset":160,"end_offset":174},{"id":63749,"label":"new_loan_purpose_reason","start_offset":176,"end_offset":269},{"id":63750,"label":"GCD_present_residence_since","start_offset":272,"end_offset":306},{"id":63751,"label":"aspect","start_offset":272,"end_offset":295},{"id":63752,"label":"aspect","start_offset":296,"end_offset":306},{"id":63753,"label":"GCD_present_employment_since","start_offset":311,"end_offset":377},{"id":63754,"label":"aspect","start_offset":311,"end_offset":340},{"id":63755,"label":"aspect","start_offset":341,"end_offset":352},{"id":63758,"label":"aspect","start_offset":423,"end_offset":465},{"id":63756,"label":"aspect","start_offset":378,"end_offset":421},{"id":63759,"label":"new_income","start_offset":378,"end_offset":465},{"id":63760,"label":"GCD_savings_account\/bonds","start_offset":467,"end_offset":517},{"id":63761,"label":"aspect","start_offset":486,"end_offset":494},{"id":63762,"label":"aspect","start_offset":495,"end_offset":517},{"id":63763,"label":"GCD_property","start_offset":523,"end_offset":553},{"id":63764,"label":"specification","start_offset":544,"end_offset":553},{"id":63765,"label":"GCD_status_of_existing_checking_account","start_offset":555,"end_offset":591},{"id":63766,"label":"new_income","start_offset":593,"end_offset":670},{"id":63768,"label":"aspect","start_offset":673,"end_offset":686},{"id":63770,"label":"aspect","start_offset":687,"end_offset":721},{"id":63771,"label":"aspect","start_offset":722,"end_offset":742},{"id":63772,"label":"GCD_credit_history","start_offset":673,"end_offset":781},{"id":63773,"label":"aspect","start_offset":744,"end_offset":781},{"id":63774,"label":"new_other_expenses","start_offset":782,"end_offset":810},{"id":63775,"label":"GCD_housing","start_offset":812,"end_offset":871},{"id":63776,"label":"aspect","start_offset":816,"end_offset":832},{"id":63777,"label":"specification","start_offset":833,"end_offset":842},{"id":63778,"label":"aspect","start_offset":843,"end_offset":871},{"id":63779,"label":"GCD_installment_rate","start_offset":873,"end_offset":962},{"id":63780,"label":"aspect","start_offset":910,"end_offset":940},{"id":63781,"label":"aspect","start_offset":941,"end_offset":962},{"id":63782,"label":"new_personality","start_offset":965,"end_offset":1055},{"id":63783,"label":"aspect","start_offset":965,"end_offset":995},{"id":63784,"label":"aspect","start_offset":1000,"end_offset":1026},{"id":63785,"label":"aspect","start_offset":1027,"end_offset":1055}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":41,"text":"Letter 5  \nDüsseldorf, 14 September 2025  \n\nDear Members of the Credit Board,  \n\nI am David Mbembe, a Cameroonian citizen residing in Germany for eleven years, and currently a senior customs clerk with the Federal Customs Service in Düsseldorf (employment start: February 2014). I request a loan of 3,331 € for twelve months to replace worn household furniture and purchase a computer for my son’s secondary-school studies.  \n\nMy net monthly earnings are 2,980 €, supplemented by a yearly civil-service bonus. I have a small retail furniture debt of 46 € per month and an educational micro-loan with Sparkasse (balance 1,200 €) that will be fully repaid in eight months. Assets include an 8,000 € building-society savings contract and a 12,500 € life-insurance policy, both active since 2017.  \n\nAll prior loans have been paid as agreed; your bank currently holds my eco-heating credit, serviced for 18 months without default. Although I presently lack a checking account, opening one with you is my next step for salary deposits. The proposed installment—around 65 €—is easily covered by my 700 € monthly surplus.  \n\nI pride myself on integrity, proven public-service employment, and stable residency. I welcome the opportunity to discuss any details in person.  \n\nThank you for your consideration.  \n\nYours faithfully,  \nDavid Mbembe","model":"o3","letter_id":"5","profile_id":"869","entities":[{"id":63968,"label":"new_name","start_offset":86,"end_offset":98},{"id":63969,"label":"GCD_foreign_worker","start_offset":102,"end_offset":158},{"id":63970,"label":"new_nationality","start_offset":102,"end_offset":121},{"id":63971,"label":"aspect","start_offset":142,"end_offset":158},{"id":63972,"label":"GCD_job","start_offset":164,"end_offset":243},{"id":63973,"label":"specification","start_offset":174,"end_offset":196},{"id":63974,"label":"aspect","start_offset":197,"end_offset":229},{"id":63975,"label":"aspect","start_offset":230,"end_offset":243},{"id":63976,"label":"GCD_present_employment_since","start_offset":245,"end_offset":276},{"id":63977,"label":"GCD_credit_amount","start_offset":299,"end_offset":306},{"id":63978,"label":"GCD_duration_in_month","start_offset":311,"end_offset":324},{"id":63979,"label":"GCD_purpose","start_offset":328,"end_offset":422},{"id":63980,"label":"specification","start_offset":336,"end_offset":360},{"id":63981,"label":"aspect","start_offset":365,"end_offset":384},{"id":63982,"label":"aspect","start_offset":385,"end_offset":422},{"id":63984,"label":"new_income","start_offset":427,"end_offset":508},{"id":63985,"label":"aspect","start_offset":464,"end_offset":508},{"id":63986,"label":"GCD_other_installment_plans","start_offset":510,"end_offset":669},{"id":63987,"label":"aspect","start_offset":519,"end_offset":564},{"id":63988,"label":"aspect","start_offset":569,"end_offset":609},{"id":63989,"label":"aspect","start_offset":611,"end_offset":626},{"id":63990,"label":"aspect","start_offset":627,"end_offset":669},{"id":63992,"label":"aspect","start_offset":671,"end_offset":696},{"id":63993,"label":"aspect","start_offset":697,"end_offset":730},{"id":63994,"label":"aspect","start_offset":737,"end_offset":768},{"id":63995,"label":"aspect","start_offset":769,"end_offset":791},{"id":63991,"label":"GCD_other_installment_plans","start_offset":671,"end_offset":792},{"id":63996,"label":"GCD_credit_history","start_offset":796,"end_offset":836},{"id":63997,"label":"GCD_credit_history","start_offset":838,"end_offset":926},{"id":63999,"label":"GCD_status_of_existing_checking_account","start_offset":927,"end_offset":1029},{"id":64000,"label":"aspect","start_offset":973,"end_offset":1009},{"id":64001,"label":"aspect","start_offset":1010,"end_offset":1029},{"id":64002,"label":"GCD_installment_rate","start_offset":1031,"end_offset":1114},{"id":64003,"label":"aspect","start_offset":1068,"end_offset":1113},{"id":64004,"label":"new_income","start_offset":1092,"end_offset":1113},{"id":64005,"label":"new_personality","start_offset":1118,"end_offset":1202},{"id":64006,"label":"aspect","start_offset":1147,"end_offset":1180},{"id":64007,"label":"aspect","start_offset":1185,"end_offset":1202},{"id":64008,"label":"aspect","start_offset":1203,"end_offset":1263}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
