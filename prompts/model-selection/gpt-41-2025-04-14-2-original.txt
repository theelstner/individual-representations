Letter 1:
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jozef Nowak, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1169 DM to purchase a new television and radio set for my home. I am currently employed as a maintenance supervisor at Siemens AG, where I have worked for the past 9 years. My employment is stable, and I have been living in my own home in Stuttgart for the past 4 years.

Although my checking account is currently overdrawn due to unexpected medical expenses for my son, I have always prioritized my financial obligations. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly and am on track with payments. I own my residence and a small property in Poland, which provides additional security.

I believe I am a reliable candidate for this loan, as I have a consistent employment record, property ownership, and a clear plan to meet the 4% installment payments. This purchase is important for my quality of life, and I am committed to fulfilling my obligations.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Jozef Nowak

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Miguel Alvarez, and I am requesting a loan of 1169 DM to purchase a new radio and television. After 8 years as a customs officer at the Hamburg port authority, I have demonstrated steady employment and reliability. I have lived in my own home for 4 years and am responsible for supporting my nephew.

While my checking account is currently negative, this is due to a recent family emergency back in Spain, which I have now resolved. I have two other small loans with your bank, which I am repaying on time. I do not have other installment plans or guarantors, but I am the sole owner of my property.

As a foreign worker, I take my responsibilities seriously and have always honored my commitments. I am confident that I can meet the repayment terms, and this purchase will greatly enhance my home life.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Miguel Alvarez

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1169 DM to buy a television and radio set. My name is Tomasz Zielinski, and I have worked as a certified laboratory technician at BASF for 10 years. I am a single father supporting my adult daughter as she completes her studies.

Although my account is currently overdrawn, my financial difficulties are temporary and stem from recent home repairs. I have two existing credits with your bank, both in good standing, and no other outstanding debts. I own my home and have lived there for 4 years.

I am committed to meeting the 4% installment payments and believe my long-term employment and property ownership demonstrate my trustworthiness. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,
Tomasz Zielinski

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Ahmed El Sayed, and I am applying for a loan of 1169 DM to purchase a new television and radio for my home. I am currently employed as a railway signal controller with Deutsche Bahn, a position I have held for 7 years.

I am a diligent worker and have always honored my commitments. I am confident in my ability to repay this loan and would be grateful for your support.
