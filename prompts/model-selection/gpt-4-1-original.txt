Letter 1:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1169 DM to purchase a new radio/television set. My current set is outdated and I'm seeking to upgrade to better keep up with the news and world events. As a foreign worker in Germany, it is important for me to stay connected with the happenings around the globe.

I am a single male, aged 67, and have been employed as a civil engineer for the past 8 years. Despite the critical status of my checking account and having no known savings, I have a stable income and own a real estate property. I have been living at my present residence for 4 years and have managed to pay off my previous loans in a timely manner.

I assure you that I am a reliable candidate and will adhere to the 4% installment rate set by your bank. I have a telephone for easy communication and look forward to a positive response from your end.

Yours sincerely,
[Your Name]

Letter 2:

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1169 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television set. My old one has become unreliable and I need a new one to continue my work as a remote IT specialist.

I am a 67-year-old single male who has been employed in my current job for over 7 years. I understand that my financial status may raise concerns, given my checking account is currently in the negative and I have no savings account. However, I have always been diligent in repaying my debts and I own my house outright, which should provide some assurance of my financial stability.

I am committed to meeting the 4% installment rate and I am confident in my ability to repay this loan within the stipulated time frame. I am a responsible debtor and I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Letter 3:

I am a skilled plumber and have been employed for the past 9 years. I understand that my checking account status and lack of savings may cause apprehension. However, I own a property and have successfully managed my financial responsibilities, including two previous credits with your bank.

I am confident that I can manage the 4% installment rate and assure you of my commitment to fulfill my obligations. I look forward to your positive response.

Letter 4:

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1169 DM. I am a 67-year-old single man, employed as a carpenter for the last 7 years. I need this loan to buy a new television, as my current one is no longer working.

I understand that my financial situation, with a negative balance in my checking account and no savings, is not ideal. However, I have always been responsible with my finances. I own my home and have managed to repay all my previous loans on time.

I am committed to repaying the loan at the agreed 4% installment rate and I assure you of my reliability as a debtor. I hope for a favorable response.

Yours faithfully,
[Your Name]
