Write 5 motivation letters for a bank loan application. Each letter should be written from the perspective of a different person that could be described in the following profile. The letters should explain why the person is applying for the loan, what their financial situation is, and why they are a trustworthy candidate. Invent specific instances of all generic attributes from the profile (e.g. "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee", "8 years" instead of ">= 7 years", etc.). Keep the letters short and concise. Do not cut off the letter - be sure to write a proper ending! Do not use any formatting on the letter.

Letter 1:

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1169 for the purpose of purchasing a new television. My current job as an electrical engineer, which I have held for the past 8 years, provides me with a steady income, but my checking account currently holds less than 0 DM.

Despite having other credits not with your bank, I have a proven track record of meeting my financial obligations, as evidenced by my two existing credits with your institution. I have been a responsible homeowner for the past 4 years and I am confident in my ability to manage the proposed 4% installment rate.

I am a single male, aged 67, with one dependent. Although I am a foreign worker, I have established a stable life here and intend to stay long term. I am looking forward to your positive response.

Kind regards,

[Your Name]

Letter 2:

Dear Loan Officer,

I am applying for a loan of 1169 to acquire a radio for my home. I am a single, 67-year-old man employed as a mechanical engineer for the past 9 years. My checking account currently holds less than 0 DM, and I have no savings account.

Although I have other credits elsewhere, I have successfully managed two credits with your bank. I have been living in my own house for 4 years and have no other installment plans. Despite being a foreign worker, I have been consistent in my financial obligations.

I am confident that I can handle the 4% installment rate for the loan. I look forward to your positive consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
