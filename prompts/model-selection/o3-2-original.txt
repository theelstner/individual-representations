Stuttgart, 15 July 2025

Dear Loan Committee,

My name is Miguel Alvarez, a 67-year-old senior machine technician employed at Stuttgart Toolworks for the past nine years. I am requesting a six-month loan of DM 1,169 to purchase a new digital television-radio set so my grandson, whom I support, can continue his distance-learning courses.

Although my current checking account is slightly overdrawn after recent roof repairs, my financial base is solid. I own my fully paid-off house on Schillerstraße, valued at DM 220,000, and hold a secure permanent contract with a net monthly income of DM 3,400. I have two small, well-serviced credits with your bank and no other installment plans.

The requested amount will be repaid at 4 % installments automatically debited from my salary account. My stable employment, property ownership, and clean repayment record with you underline my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available by telephone at any time for additional information.

Sincerely,
Miguel Alvarez

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am Ahmed Khan, a single 67-year-old senior customs officer at the Port of Hamburg, serving for eight years under civil-service status. I wish to finance a DM 1,169 smart TV-radio combination unit that will allow me to follow maritime traffic updates from home and tutor my dependent nephew.

My checking account shows a temporary negative balance after I advanced school fees for the boy, but my monthly net income of DM 3,600 and a paid-up townhouse in Altona valued at DM 190,000 provide ample security. I have two modest credits with your bank—both paid punctually—and no other debt.

With a six-month term and 4 % installments, repayment will be deducted from my salary account, ensuring full transparency. My long public-sector career and property ownership make me a trustworthy borrower.

Kind regards,
Ahmed Khan

Dear Loans Department,

I am Georgi Petrov, age 67, employed as a certified electrical draftsman for Deutsche Bahn for ten consecutive years. I request a DM 1,169 loan over six months to upgrade my aging radio and television so I can continue monitoring technical broadcasts relevant to my work and entertain my dependent daughter.

A recent medical bill pushed my checking account below zero, yet my net monthly salary of DM 3,250, combined with a mortgage-free apartment worth DM 160,000, guarantees repayment capacity. I maintain two active credits with your institution and have never missed a payment.

I agree to repay the loan through 4 % monthly installments via direct debit. My stable income, debt-free real estate, and spotless repayment history attest to my reliability.

Thank you for your consideration. I am reachable by phone for any clarification.

Respectfully,
Georgi Petrov

Dear Credit Officer,

My name is Paolo Ricci, a laboratory glassware specialist at BASF, employed for 7 ½ years. I seek a DM 1,169 loan to buy a combined DAB radio and 4K television, enabling me to follow industry webinars and provide educational programming to the grandson in my care.

While my current account shows a small overdraft after unexpected dental surgery, I draw a steady DM 3,300 net each month and own a detached house on Berliner Ring, valued at DM 210,000. I hold two punctual credits with your bank and carry no other obligations.

With a 4 % installment rate over six months, repayment will be automatic from my salary account. My long-term employment, property equity, and consistent payment record reflect my trustworthiness.

I appreciate your favorable review and remain available by telephone for any questions.

Sincerely,
Paolo Ricci

Dear Banking Team,

I am Victor Santos, 67, serving as a municipal bus dispatcher for the Munich Transport Authority for eleven years. I request a DM 1,169 loan payable over six months to replace my outdated radio-television unit, essential for following transit bulletins and supporting my dependent grandson’s studies.

My checking account is temporarily negative because of recent property-tax adjustments, yet my net salary of DM 3,500 and a debt-free condominium in Schwabing valued at DM 185,000 underpin my financial stability. I maintain two existing credits with your bank, both serviced flawlessly.

I will repay the loan at the agreed 4 % installment rate through automatic deduction. My secure public-sector position, real-estate ownership, and impeccable repayment history qualify me as a reliable borrower.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Feel free to call me should further information be required.

Best regards,
Victor Santos
