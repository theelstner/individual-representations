Assistant
Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1169 DM to purchase a new television. I have been employed as a senior logistics manager at Global Freight Solutions for the past 8 years, which has provided me with a stable income. My financial situation has been challenging recently due to unexpected medical expenses for my dependent son, which temporarily put my checking account in the negative.

Despite these challenges, I am confident in my ability to manage the loan responsibly. I own real estate and have been residing in my current home for 4 years, which reflects my stability and commitment. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which are in good standing.

I assure you of my dedication to meeting the installment rate of 4% and maintaining a positive relationship with your bank. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am seeking a loan of 1169 DM to buy a new radio for my home. I have been a foreign language interpreter with the International Communication Center for the past 9 years, and my job provides a reliable income. While my checking account is currently below zero due to unforeseen home repair costs, I am actively working to restore my financial balance.

I have no other installment plans and own my residence, which underscores my financial responsibility. Although I have other credits, they are managed outside of your bank and are being paid regularly.

I am confident in my ability to repay the loan promptly and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

To Whom It May Concern,

I am applying for a loan of 1169 DM to purchase a television. For the past 10 years, I have been employed as a project coordinator with EcoBuild Solutions, ensuring a consistent income. My current financial setback, resulting in a negative checking account, is due to supporting my elderly parent overseas.

I have owned my home for 4 years and have no other installment obligations. I am committed to maintaining my good standing with your bank, where I have two existing credits.

I am a reliable candidate for this loan, and I look forward to your favorable response.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]

Dear Bank Manager,

I am writing to request a loan of 1169 DM for the purpose of purchasing a radio. I have been a quality control supervisor at Bright Tech Industries for the last 7 years. My financial difficulties, leading to a negative checking account balance, arose from unexpected legal fees.

Owning my home and having no other installment plans demonstrate my financial stability. I have two credits with your bank, both of which are well-maintained.

I am committed to repaying the loan with the agreed installment rate and am grateful for your consideration of my application.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
