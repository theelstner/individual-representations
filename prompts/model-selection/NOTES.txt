STRATEGY
Manual transformation of generated natural language profiles to feature sets. Two rounds of each 5 letters were generated by the same model. NL features were inserted to original feature set and original feature set was expanded throughout the process. We enter all nlp sentences in the form, but never infer information that is not explicit.


NLF (natural language feature) in the following is a feature from the natural language profile, OF (original feature) is the feature from the german credit dataset. (original / NL ) feature values are the specific values to them.

- NLF values == OF values: entered into the form as is
- NLF value != OF value but meaning is the same (e.g. "2" vs "two", or "< 0" vs "overdrawn") are entered as OF value but NLF vale is provided
- NLF value meaning != OF value meaning are replaced with NLF value
- NLF value != OF value and NLF value meaning is ambiguous are entered as not present ( - ) with NLF value in brackets
- missing NLF values are entered as ( - )
- additional NLFs are appended at the bottom of the profile with [NLF : value] with last OF being "foreign worker"
- the next form is always built on the feature set of the previous form, so that the last form should be the longest. feature values should become more sparse, feature sets grow.

NOTES
*GPT-4.1

- "while i have some existing credit obligations" -> not clearly stated if credits at other bank or credits at this bank.
- "With no savings at present" -> unclear if savings account exists and is empty or if savings at present refers to overdrawn checking account feature
- repetition in 2-1: "However, I have maintained steady employment and own my home in Frankfurt, where I have lived for 4 years. My income is stable, and I have always made timely payments on my existing loans with your bank." and "I believe my long-term employment, property ownership, and responsible credit history with your bank demonstrate my reliability."

*o3

- contains much more detail on everything than both gpt-41 variants => many new features had to be had to be integrated to the form.
- corrects spelling errors from prompt (installment rate -> instalment rate)
- installment payment method was added later. the feature came up in letters before, too, but i overlooked it as feature category and placed it within more generic features like "other securities"

*GPT-4o
- letters almost seem unrealistic. too many details in one category (personality traits, insecurities), too few on others: job, purpose reason, real estate value etc
	- or is it good that these letters are completely different? -> who knows maybe some people would write letters like this. could be an asset to have very different styles, removing them later is always an option.
- "other installment plans : none" and "other credits not at this bank" and "2 other credits at this bank" fit toghether only like this: other credits not at this bank and two other credits at this bank have already been paid off. (neraly?) ALL MODELS seem to have gotten that wrong.
- Property: - (FROM own my home) just realized "i own my home" could also mean they own a car in which they live.

*GPT-4
- more basic letters. jobs are more down to earth (e.g plumber), and phrasing is closer to phrasing in original features (e.g. "My checking account currently holds less than 0 DM, and I have no savings account." and "Status of existing checking account: < 0 DM, Savings account/bonds: unknown / no savings account")
- homeowner could be a person who owns a car and lives in it
- "Present employment since: - (FROM employed as a chemical engineer for the last 7 years)" -> we are interested in how long the person kept the same job with the same employer not if the person was still working in accordance with their education
- letters within a prompt do not differ as much in facts/details but rather in structure. even synonyms are not used often, st sentences are the same as in letters before. letters are quite the same in the selection of things they mention and what they leave out

*LLAMA
- unrealistic letters due to very casual language (e.g. introduction with first name only,)
- many mistakes (e.g. frequently changed age feature, even though told not to in prompt)

*GENERAL
- gcd profile feature can be mentioned, but become ambiguous. E.g. gpt-41-2025-04-14-1-2 "Present residence since: - (aquired own home 4 years ago)"
- some features fit multiple categories (dependent brother but we do not know if there are more), family at least one brother but we do not know if there are more (we entered the values everywhere were we saw fit, including repeats within feature values)
- human induced inconsistencies like: a sentence with the structure "i am <personality trait 1>, <other securities 1>, and <personality trait 2>"  may have been split. or in other letters just be kept as one.
- unclear how to handle causal relations like reasoning about facts. e.g. "I do not have other installment plans or guarantors, but I am the sole owner of my property." currently we enter them in separate categories but when the reason is stong enough, they are entered to "personality traits" or "other securities". not this one in the example. this was entered to goarantors: none, other installment plans: none, and other securities "i am the sole owner of my property"
- of course variation of profiles is limited to the capacities of the llm. we expect the real world to be more diverse and surprising. however, results that we cannot solve with limited (llm generated) diversity, we will not be able to solve in the more diverse real world.
- unclear how dependent is defined (e.g. "I live with my daugher" -> is sb whom you live with your dependent? "I support my adult son" -> is an adult family member a dependent?). This may have led to inconsistent entries in the feature values
- unclear how foreign worker is defined (e.g. "naturalized German citizen originally from Morocco". We used "no" as foreign worker value, but the variable "migration background : Morocco" would hold the other information )
-  one argument can be made for multiple categories. (from gpt-4-1-2-3)unclear if "keeping up with technological advancements in my field" is an explanation for buying a new radio and television or if it was meant to be an argument in favor of the person's work ethic/commitment "I am writing to request a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new radio and television. I have been employed as a mechanical engineer at Siemens AG for the past 10 years, and I am committed to keeping up with technological advancements in my field." could be both, entered it in both "purpose reason" and "personality traits 1".
- Some sentences could be interpreted to fit two attributes: "I presently service two loans from your institution—a roof repair and language course—both paid punctually by standing order." -> other securities (provably pays back the money in time), and interpreted personality trait "well-organized" (FROM paid punctually by standing order)
- it would have been better, to fill in the form just with snippets of the letters, now there is a mixture between values that come from original categories (e.g. "Purpose: radio/television") and NLFs were features do not fall into categories as per their phrasing but only due to their semantics (e.g. "Overdrawn checking account status: temporarily" or "Other securities 2: I maintain two existing credits with your bank, both serviced flawlessly."). Original feature values do not provide as much detail (radio/television applies also to letters were only a new television is mentioned)
- some features take phrases out of context, e.g. "Insecurities: My financial situation has been challenging recently" -> from "ns for the past 8 years, which has provided me with a stable income. My financial situation has been challenging recently due to unexpected medical expenses for my dependent son, which temporarily put my checking account in the negative." Others that may not have explicitly mentioned a challenging financial situation get a "-" in "Inconsistency" even though their checking account may be overdrawn for the exact same reason.
- "other installment plans : none" and "other credits not at this bank" and "2 other credits at this bank" fit toghether only like this: other credits not at this bank and two other credits at this bank have already been paid off. (neraly?) ALL MODELS seem to have gotten that wrong (i only realised it at gpt-4o-1-3)
- assume nothing, also not the obvious, like "Other securities"I have successfully managed two credits with your bank"" -> we need "other securities" maybe the bank did not yet check whether existing credits at their institution were managed successfully. this may be a strong indicator and we cannot know what the bank did with the information even if it seems obvious what they used it for.

TODO:
- correct other installment plans + existing credits + running credit obligations before gpt-4o-2-3: other installment plans none means all existing credits at this bank have been paid of, there are no more debts, also not at other credit institutions (other credits at other banks are paid off as well)
- correct property real estate before gpt-4o-2-5 ("i own my home/residence/etc" could also mean they live in their car)
- correct Present employment since: - (FROM have been employed as a civil engineer for the past 8 years) or similar. up until gpt-4-1-1 i have not noticed that present employment means with the same employer not with the same job/skill
- correct skilled employee

- feature personal circumstances was introduced only after gpt-4.1-04-14-2025 was fully processed in gpt-4.1-2-2 but could apply to previous NLFs too

QUESTIONS:
- How to deal with categories that have been discovered later? Should all cases be re-assessed according to the new feature? e.g.:feature personal circumstances was introduced only after gpt-4.1-04-14-2025 was fully processed in gpt-4.1-2-2 but could apply to previous NLFs too
- think about the difference it makes to handle explicit vs implicit positive or negative arguments and the relation to verification+proofs: an explicitly mentioned negative argument does not have to be proven (i am unreliable), an explicitly mentioned positive argument must (i am reliable), an implicitly mentioned negative argument must be verified(+proven?-> who would do that?) (if correctly understood), an implicitly mentioned positive argument can?/must? be verified+proven
	- btw: verification: "did i understand implicit argument correctly?"
					proof: "make me believe that xy is true" (e.g. by example...)


IDEAS:
- to be sure natural language text and individual circumstances can be uniformely entered to a profile, we need crisp definitions on what the attributes mean (see above defintion of dependent for an example). if an nlf value still does fit the defintion this needs to be resolved!
- which questions do you need to ask back to the human that is to be represented? 
	- e.g. others have written about... do you have anything to add about that
	- this is unclear: please clarify if "grandson, whom i support" is your dependent and if there are more dependents
- not iterate over old letters/decisions -> it may be ok to improve the system over time?! (otherwise we come back to continual learning which is at core an efficiency problem)
- can i automatically match the letters to the profiles they were generated from? if yes, what does that mean?


ANNOTATION RULES:
- never interpret ANY information you read in the generated texts
	- this includes not using the preset categories as feature values: 
		- e.g. if text says two, do not write 2 in the form
		- e.g. on a semantic level: if text says "i own my home" do not enter "property:real estate", they could also be living in their car, instead write property: i own my home
		- e.g. "Present employment since: -" because it cannot be 100% certain be deduced from "have been employed for the past 9 years". We do not know it is the same employer. Insted, there must be a new, additional feature, e.g. "Seemless employment since: 9 years")
- never judge any information as to if it is true or untrue, but note inconsistencies within letters
