Assistant
Letter 1 – From a Scientific Research Assistant

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. As a scientific research assistant at the Max Planck Institute, where I have been employed for 8 years, I rely on up-to-date media equipment for both my work and personal enrichment.

My current financial situation is temporarily strained, as my checking account is currently overdrawn and I have existing credit obligations outside your bank. However, I have maintained steady employment and own my home in Frankfurt, where I have lived for 4 years. My income is stable, and I have always made timely payments on my existing loans with your bank.

With no savings at present, this loan is essential for me to stay connected with news and educational programs. I am a single father supporting my adult son, and I take my financial commitments very seriously. I believe my long-term employment, property ownership, and responsible credit history with your bank demonstrate my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dragan Petrovic

Letter 2 – From a Customs Officer

Dear Loan Officer,

I am seeking a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. As a customs officer at the Hamburg Port Authority, I have worked in this role for 9 years and take great pride in my service and financial responsibility.

Although my current account is overdrawn and I have two existing loans with your bank, I have never missed an installment. I own my residence in Hamburg and have lived here for 4 years, providing stability for myself and my dependent son. Unfortunately, I do not have a savings account at this time due to recent family expenses.

As a single man supporting my son, this loan will help me provide essential access to news and information, which is important for both my work and our daily life. My property ownership, stable career, and history of meeting payment obligations make me a trustworthy candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ivan Kovacs

Letter 3 – From a Mechanical Engineer

Dear Banking Team,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new radio and television. I have been employed as a mechanical engineer at Siemens AG for the past 10 years, and I am committed to keeping up with technological advancements in my field.

Currently, my checking account is below zero, and I have other credits outside your bank, but I have always honored my financial commitments and have two active credits with your institution, both in good standing. I own my home in Munich, where I have resided for 4 years, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

As a single father supporting my adult daughter, my resources are sometimes stretched, but my property and steady employment ensure I am a reliable borrower. I have no savings at present but am confident I can manage the monthly installment rate of 4%.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Ahmed Al-Mansouri

Letter 4 – From a Public Health Official

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am applying for a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a modern television and radio. I have been employed as a public health official in Stuttgart for 7 years, and staying informed is essential for my job and family.

My financial situation is currently challenging, as my checking account is overdrawn and I have existing credits elsewhere. However, I have consistently paid my two loans with your bank on time. I own my home, have lived here for 4 years, and have no other debts or installment plans.

Supporting my dependent nephew as a single man, I am committed to meeting my financial responsibilities. My property, stable employment, and positive repayment history with your bank reflect my trustworthiness.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Piotr Nowak
