Letter 1:

Dear Loan Officer,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1169 DM for the purchase of a new television. As a 67-year-old electrical engineer with over 8 years at my current firm, I have a stable income and a strong work ethic. Despite a current negative balance in my checking account, due to unforeseen medical expenses for my dependent, I am committed to managing my finances responsibly.

I own my home and have no other installment plans, which allows me to allocate funds towards this loan. My credit history shows some critical accounts, but I have successfully managed two credits at your bank in the past, demonstrating my reliability.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident in my ability to meet the installment rate of 4% and look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Owning real estate and having no other debts apart from two credits at your bank, I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling this obligation. The requested loan will enhance my quality of life and allow me to remain informed and entertained.

I appreciate your consideration and am eager to continue my positive relationship with your bank.

Best regards,

Dear [Bank Name] Team,

I am applying for a 1169 DM loan to purchase a new television. As a skilled mechanic with 10 years of service at my current job, I have a steady income and a history of reliability. My current negative account balance is due to recent support provided to my dependent, but I am working diligently to rectify this.

I own my home and have been residing there for 4 years, which reflects my stability. While my credit history includes some critical accounts, I have maintained two credits at your bank without issue.

I hope to receive your support for this loan, which will significantly enhance my living conditions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,
