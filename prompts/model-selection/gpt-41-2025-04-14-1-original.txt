Letter 1:
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Aleksandr Petrov, and I am writing to apply for a loan of 1169 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I have been employed as a mechanical technician at Siemens AG for the past 9 years, and I have lived in my own home in Munich for 4 years. Although my current checking account is temporarily overdrawn due to recent medical expenses for my dependent son, I have always prioritized my financial obligations. My real estate property provides security, and I have successfully managed two previous credits with your bank without issue.

I have no other installment plans and no guarantors. My current debts are well-structured and being paid on time, and I am confident in my ability to meet the 4% installment rate. As a single father and foreign worker, I am committed to stability for my family. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Aleksandr Petrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Youssef El-Masri, and I respectfully submit my application for a loan of 1169 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. I have worked as a customs official at the Hamburg port authority for 8 years and currently reside in my own home, which I acquired 4 years ago.

My financial situation is currently strained, with my checking account below zero, due in part to supporting my adult daughter through her university studies. I do not have a savings account, but my property serves as collateral. I have maintained a responsible payment record with my two existing loans at your bank, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors.

Despite my foreign worker status, I have demonstrated reliability and a strong work ethic. I am confident that I will be able to meet the required installment rate and repay the loan within the agreed period.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Youssef El-Masri

Letter 3:
Dear Bank Manager,

I am Jan Novak, a 67-year-old single man residing in Frankfurt, where I have owned my house for the past four years. I am employed as a senior electrician at Deutsche Bahn, a position I have held for 10 years. I am seeking a loan of 1169 DM to purchase a new television and radio, as my current devices have stopped working.

While my checking account is currently overdrawn, this is a temporary situation due to recent repairs on my property. My credit history includes some other credits, but none with your bank, and my record with your institution is positive. I have no savings account, but my real estate is a significant asset. I have no other installment plans and am prepared to meet the 4% repayment rate.

As a foreign worker with a dependent grandson, I take my financial responsibilities seriously and have always paid my dues on time. I trust you will consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,
Jan Novak

Letter 4:
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Emilio García, and I am applying for a loan of 1169 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I have been a postal service supervisor for 8 years and have lived in my own apartment in Stuttgart for the last 4 years.

Currently, my checking account is overdrawn, mainly due to unexpected healthcare expenses for my dependent brother. I do not have a savings account, but I do own real estate that provides financial security. I have two active credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly. I have no additional installment plans or guarantors.

As a single, foreign national, I am committed to fulfilling my obligations. My employment is stable, and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan at the proposed installment rate. Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,
Emilio García

Dear Loan Department,

I am Piotr Zielinski, a Polish-born engineer living in Berlin, and I am applying for a 1169 DM loan to purchase a new radio and television. I have worked as a civil engineering inspector for the city for 8 years, and I have owned my home for 4 years.

I have two existing credits at your bank and have maintained timely payments on both. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors.

Despite my foreign status, I have demonstrated financial responsibility and commitment throughout my career. I am confident in my ability to meet the 4% installment rate. I would greatly appreciate your favorable consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Piotr Zielinski
