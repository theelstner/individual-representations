Here is an example of a loan application letter to a bank written by the person behind the profile:

"Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. As a 67-year-old single man, I have been living in my own house in Stuttgart for the past four years. I am employed as a master electrician at Bosch GmbH, where I have worked for the last nine years. My employment is stable and provides a reliable monthly income.

I have one dependent, my grandson, who lives with me and whom I support financially. My checking account is currently overdrawn due to recent expenses related to my grandson’s education and some necessary home repairs. While I do not have a savings account, I own my home outright and also have a small piece of land in the outskirts of the city.

I have two ongoing credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly and paid on schedule. I also have a small credit with another institution, but I have never missed a payment on any of my obligations. I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors.

As a foreign worker originally from Hungary, I have always prioritized stability and reliability, both in my professional and personal life. I am available by telephone at any time and am happy to provide any additional information if needed.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my steady employment, property ownership, and responsible payment history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
<your name>"


Write a new motivation letter for a bank loan application. It should explain why you are applying for the loan, what your financial situation is, and why you are a trustworthy candidate. Invent specific instances of all generic attributes from the profile (e.g. "scientific research assistant" instead of "skilled employee",  any number of years larger than 7 instead of ">= 7 years", etc.). Keep the letter short and concise. Do not cut off the letter - be sure to write a proper ending! Do not use any formatting on the letter.
