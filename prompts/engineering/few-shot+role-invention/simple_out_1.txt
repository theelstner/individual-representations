Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I am a 67-year-old single man and have been living in my own house in Augsburg for the past four years. I am currently employed as a maintenance supervisor at the Deutsche Bahn rail yard, a position I have held for the last eight years. My job is secure and provides me with a regular monthly income.

I have one dependent, my niece, who moved in with me after her parents relocated abroad for work. My checking account is currently overdrawn due to covering her school expenses and some unexpected home repairs. I do not have a savings account, but I fully own my house and a small plot of land just outside the city.

I have two active credits with your bank, both of which I have always paid on time. Additionally, I have a small personal loan from a local cooperative bank, which I have never defaulted on. I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors.

As a foreign worker from Slovakia, I value reliability and consistency, both at work and in managing my finances. I am always available by telephone should you require any further information.

Thank you for considering my application. I believe that my long-term employment, responsible payment history, and property ownership demonstrate that I am a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Tomas Novak
