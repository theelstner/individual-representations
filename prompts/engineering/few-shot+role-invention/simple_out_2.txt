Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to request a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new radio and television for my home. I am a 67-year-old single man and have been living in my own house in Augsburg for the past four years. I have worked as a certified industrial mechanic at Krauss-Maffei Technologies for the past eleven years, where I have maintained a steady and reliable employment record.

I have one dependent, my niece, who has lived with me since her parents relocated abroad for work. Recently, my checking account became overdrawn after I covered her university tuition and made urgent repairs to our heating system. Although I do not have a savings account, I fully own my home and a small orchard nearby, which adds to my financial security.

I currently have two credits with your bank, both of which I have always paid on time. I also have a minor loan with a community bank, and I have never missed a payment on any of my obligations. I do not have any other installment plans or guarantors.

As a foreign worker from Poland, I have always valued honesty, diligence, and fulfilling my commitments. I am available by telephone for any further questions or documentation you may need.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am confident that my long-term employment, property ownership, and history of responsible payments make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I look forward to your positive reply.

Sincerely,
Piotr Nowak
