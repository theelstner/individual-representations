Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. As a 67-year-old single man, I have been living in my own house in Stuttgart for the past four years. I am currently employed as a maintenance supervisor at Deutsche Bahn, where I have worked for the last nine years. My employment is secure, and I plan to continue working for as long as possible.

I have one dependent, my grandson, who lives with me and whom I help support. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn due to some recent medical expenses, I have always prioritized my financial obligations. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly and paid on time. I also have a small credit with another institution, which is being repaid regularly.

I do not have a savings account, as most of my resources are invested in my property, which I own outright. My monthly income is sufficient to cover the 4% installment rate for the requested loan, and I have no other installment plans or guarantors. I am a foreign worker from Hungary, and I have always made an effort to be a reliable member of the community.

I am available by telephone at any time should you need further information. I believe my long-term employment, property ownership, and history of responsible repayments make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Janos Varga
