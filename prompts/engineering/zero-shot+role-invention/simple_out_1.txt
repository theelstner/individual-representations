Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new radio and television set for my home. As a 67-year-old single man, I have been living in my own house in Stuttgart for the past four years. I am currently employed as a maintenance supervisor at Bosch, where I have worked for the last nine years. My employment is stable and provides a reliable monthly income.

I have one dependent, my son, who is currently studying at university and whom I support financially. Although my checking account is currently overdrawn due to some unexpected medical bills, I have always prioritized my financial obligations. I have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I have managed responsibly and paid on time. While I do have other credits outside your bank, I have never missed a payment.

I do not have a savings account at the moment, as most of my assets are invested in my property, which I own outright. My monthly salary is sufficient to cover the 4% installment rate for this loan, and I am confident in my ability to meet all repayment terms. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors.

As a foreign worker who has lived in Germany for many years, I have always maintained a good relationship with my community and local institutions. I am available by telephone should you require any further information.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I believe my stable employment, property ownership, and responsible credit history make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Miklos Szabo
