Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1169 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new television and radio set. I have been employed as a skilled electrician for over seven years and currently reside in my own home, where I have lived for the past four years. Although my checking account is presently overdrawn, I have real estate assets and no other installment plans.

As a single man supporting one dependent, I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations. My employment is stable, and I have been diligent in maintaining my responsibilities, even with a critical credit history. I am a foreign worker but well-integrated into the community, and I am confident in my ability to repay the loan within the agreed duration of six months at the specified installment rate of 4%.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available by telephone should you require any further information.

Yours sincerely,
Peter Novak
