Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new television and radio set. I have been employed as a mechanical engineer for over seven years, and I currently own my home. I am a single male, 67 years old, and have one dependent.

I have maintained my residence for the past four years and have two existing credits at your bank. My property consists of a family house, and I have no other debts or installment plans elsewhere. While I do not have a savings account, my long-term employment as an official at the local municipality provides me with a stable income. My installment rate is set at 4%, and I am able to manage this comfortably.

I am a foreign worker and have always met my financial obligations. I can be reached by telephone for further information or documentation.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Andreas Müller
