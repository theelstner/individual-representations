Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,169 DM to purchase a new radio and television set. As a 67-year-old single male, I have been living in my own home in Munich for the past four years. I am currently employed as a technical supervisor at Siemens AG, where I have worked for the past eight years. My employment is stable, and I am committed to continuing my work for as long as possible.

I have one dependent, my adult daughter, who occasionally relies on my support. Although my checking account has been overdrawn in recent months due to unexpected medical expenses, I have always managed my finances responsibly. I currently have two small credits with your bank, both of which I have paid on time without any missed installments. While I do have other credits outside your bank, I have never defaulted on any payments.

I do not have a savings account at this time, as most of my assets are tied up in my property, which I fully own. My monthly income is sufficient to cover the 4% installment rate for the requested loan, and I am confident in my ability to meet all repayment obligations. I have no other installment plans and no guarantors or co-debtors.

As a foreign worker, I have always strived to integrate into the community and maintain a good standing with local institutions. I am reachable by telephone at any time and am happy to provide any further information you may require.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my stable employment, property ownership, and history of responsible credit management make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Andreas Kovacs
