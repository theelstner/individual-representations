Subject: Application for Personal Loan

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to respectfully request a personal loan in the amount of 1,169 DM for the purpose of purchasing a new radio and television. As a skilled employee with over seven years of continuous service, I have always strived to manage my financial obligations responsibly and am committed to maintaining this approach in the future.

Currently, I am 67 years old, single, and have one dependent. I have been residing at my present address for the past four years, and I am the owner of my home, which is secured by real estate property. I do not have any other installment plans, and I am not supported by any guarantors or co-debtors. My current employment provides me with a stable income, and I am able to comfortably meet the proposed installment rate of 4%.

I am aware that my checking account has been negative for a short period and that my credit history includes some critical accounts and existing credits with other institutions. However, I would like to assure you that I have always prioritized my financial commitments. The existing credits at your bank have been serviced reliably, and I have maintained open communication with your team regarding my financial situation. The purpose of this loan is to ensure that I can continue to access essential information and entertainment, which is especially important for my well-being and that of my dependent.

Although I do not currently have a savings account, I have demonstrated financial stability through long-term employment, property ownership, and responsible management of my existing obligations. My status as a foreign worker has not impeded my ability to contribute positively to my community or my workplace.

I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably. I am confident that my steady income, home ownership, and commitment to meeting my financial responsibilities make me a trustworthy candidate for this loan. Should you require any additional information or documentation, I am readily available to provide it.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
[Your Name]
