Letter:
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 2,000 DM to support my educational goals. As a skilled employee with over a year of stable employment and a good credit history at your bank, I believe I have demonstrated financial responsibility.

Though I currently have limited savings and a modest checking account, I maintain a steady income and have never defaulted on my obligations. I live independently, support a dependent, and strive to improve my career through further education. I hope you will consider my application favorably.

Sincerely,  
[Name]
