Subject: Motivation Letter for Loan Application

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to respectfully apply for a loan in the amount of 1,169 DM to finance the purchase of a new radio and television. I appreciate the opportunity to present my motivation and financial background in support of my application.

I have been employed as a skilled employee/official for over seven years, and I am currently 67 years old. Throughout my career, I have maintained a stable employment record, which I believe demonstrates my commitment and reliability. I am single and have one dependent, for whom I am solely responsible. For the past four years, I have resided at my current address, where I own both the property and the housing.

The purpose of this loan is to replace outdated equipment, which is essential for both my personal and professional life. As a foreign worker, staying informed and connected is especially important, and these devices are vital for communication and access to information.

I am aware that my current checking account is slightly overdrawn, and I do not have a savings account at present. I also have two existing credits with your bank, both of which I am servicing responsibly and punctually. My overall installment rate is 4%, which I consider manageable within my monthly budget. I have no other installment plans, debtors, or guarantors.

I acknowledge that my credit history reflects previous challenges, including credits with other institutions. However, I have taken significant steps to improve my financial discipline and have consistently met my obligations at your bank. I believe my long-term employment, property ownership, and responsible handling of existing credits demonstrate my trustworthiness and stability as a candidate.

I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling the terms of this loan, as I have done with my previous financial agreements. I am confident that with your support, I can continue to maintain and improve my quality of life, while honoring my financial responsibilities.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I am available at your convenience to provide any further information or documentation you may require.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Name]
