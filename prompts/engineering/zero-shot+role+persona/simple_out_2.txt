Subject: Motivation Letter for Consumer Loan Application

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a consumer loan in the amount of 1,169 DM, with the purpose of upgrading my television and acquiring a digital audio system for my studio. As a professional art restorer with over four decades of experience across Europe, I have always valued the importance of a comfortable and inspiring environment, both for my work and personal well-being.

Having spent the last ten years in Germany, I have established my home in Leipzig, where I own a small flat. I continue to work as a consultant for museums and universities, and I am proud to have contributed to the preservation of cultural heritage in several countries. My career has required frequent travel and, at times, financial flexibility to support my family and maintain two households. While this has occasionally led to a slightly overextended financial situation, I have always honored my commitments and have never defaulted on a loan.

Currently, I have two active credits with your bank, both of which are being serviced regularly. My financial challenges in the past were primarily due to the complexities of managing accounts in different countries, but I have since stabilized my situation. I do not have formal savings, as I have prioritized supporting my dependent and investing in my professional tools and living spaces.

The requested loan will allow me to replace outdated equipment in my studio, which is essential not only for my personal comfort but also for maintaining a productive and aesthetically pleasing workspace. As someone who has dedicated his life to the arts, I believe that a harmonious environment is crucial for creativity and continued professional engagement, even in semi-retirement.

I am confident in my ability to meet the repayment terms, as my consulting work provides a steady, if modest, income, and I have real estate assets in both Spain and Germany. I kindly ask
