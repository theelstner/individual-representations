Subject: Motivation Letter for Consumer Loan Application

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Luis Rodríguez, and I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,169 DM to upgrade my television and purchase a digital audio system for my studio. I am a Spanish-born art restorer with over four decades of experience working across Europe, including the last ten years in Germany. My career has taken me to museums and universities in several countries, and I am currently based in Leipzig, where I own a small flat and continue to work as a part-time consultant.

The purpose of this loan is to replace my outdated television and to invest in a quality audio system. As someone who spends much of his time working with visual and audio materials—both for professional projects and personal enrichment—these upgrades are not only a matter of comfort but also essential tools for my ongoing consulting work. My studio is where I prepare lectures, analyze restoration projects, and keep up with developments in the art world. Modern equipment will help me maintain the high standards my clients expect.

I am aware that my financial profile shows some overextension, primarily due to my commitment to supporting family members and the costs associated with frequent travel for work. While I currently have two active loans, I have never defaulted on any payments. Any past issues with my accounts were related to the complexities of managing finances across different countries, not to a lack of responsibility. I have always prioritized meeting my obligations, and I am committed to doing so in the future.

Although I do not have formal savings, I have stable income from ongoing consulting assignments and rental income from my apartment in Madrid. I have been employed in my field for over seven years in Germany, and my property in Leipzig provides additional security. I live alone, with one dependent, and have no other installment plans or guarantors.

I
