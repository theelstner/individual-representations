Motivation Letter for Loan Application

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new radio/television set. I would like to take this opportunity to explain my reasons for applying, as well as why I believe I am a suitable candidate for this credit.

As a single, skilled employee/official with over seven years of stable employment, I have demonstrated long-term commitment and reliability in my professional life. I am currently 67 years old and continue to work actively, providing for myself and my dependent. I have resided at my current address for the past four years and am the owner of my home, which ensures stability and security in my living situation. In addition, I own real estate, which further adds to my financial stability.

Although my current checking account balance is below zero, this is a temporary situation which I am addressing. I have no other installment plans and no additional debtors or guarantors, indicating that I am solely responsible for my financial obligations. While I do have two existing credits at your bank, I have managed these responsibly, and I am committed to meeting my obligations in a timely manner.

The purpose of this loan is to replace my outdated radio/television, which has become essential for both information and leisure, especially at my age. The requested loan amount is modest, and I am confident in my ability to manage the 4% installment rate, given my steady income and lack of additional financial burdens. While I do not have a savings account at this time, my property and employment history reflect a responsible approach to managing my assets and commitments.

As a foreign worker, I am proud to have integrated successfully into the community and to have contributed consistently over the years. I am reachable by telephone and am always available to discuss my application or provide further documentation if required.

I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.
