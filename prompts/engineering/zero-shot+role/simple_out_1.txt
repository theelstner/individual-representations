Subject: Motivation Letter for Loan Application

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to formally apply for a credit of 1,169 DM, with the intended purpose of purchasing a new radio/television for my home. I wish to express my sincere motivation for this application and provide you with a clear overview of my personal and financial circumstances.

I have been a resident at my current address for the past four years, and I am proud to own my own home. Over the course of my career, I have worked as a skilled employee/official, and have been employed in my current position for more than seven years. At 67 years of age, I continue to provide for myself and my dependent, and I am committed to maintaining a stable and responsible lifestyle.

While I acknowledge that my current checking account is below 0 DM and that my credit history includes existing credits outside your bank, I would like to highlight my reliability and sense of responsibility. I have two existing credits at your bank, both of which I have managed diligently. My record with your institution should reflect my effort to meet my obligations, and I have maintained regular contact via telephone to ensure transparency regarding my finances.

It is important to note that I do not have any other installment plans or additional guarantors, and my installment rate for this loan will be a manageable 4%. Although I do not currently have a savings account, I possess real estate, which adds to my financial stability. My ongoing employment and property ownership further reinforce my capacity to meet the repayment terms of this loan.

The reason for this credit application is to improve my household living conditions by acquiring a reliable radio/television, which is essential for both information and recreation, especially given my age and responsibilities. As a foreign worker who has contributed consistently to society, I hope
