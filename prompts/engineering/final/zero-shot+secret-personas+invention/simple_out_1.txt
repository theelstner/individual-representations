Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Ivan Petrov, and I am applying for a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new television. I am a retired railway engineer with 10 years of experience at Deutsche Bahn, and I have been living in Frankfurt for the past four years, where I own my home. Although my checking account is currently below zero due to unexpected medical expenses for my dependent granddaughter, I have consistently paid my other credit obligations at your bank.

As someone with a stable career history and property ownership, I am confident in my ability to manage this loan. This television will allow me to continue educating myself and staying informed, especially as a foreign worker away from much of my family. I kindly ask for your consideration, as I am committed to meeting all installment deadlines and boosting my financial standing.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Ivan Petrov

To the Loan Officer,

My name is Hassan Abdelrahman, and I am seeking a 1,169 DM loan for the purchase of a new radio and television. I have been employed as a customs officer in Hamburg for eight years. While my current account is overdrawn, this is a temporary issue caused by recent tuition payments for my son, whom I support.

I have two existing credits with your bank that are being repaid as scheduled, despite also managing minor credits elsewhere. I do not have a savings account at this time, but I do own my home and a small apartment that I rent out. I am 67 years old and take pride in my dependable work record and responsible financial habits.

I can assure you of my commitment to fulfilling the repayment terms prudently. Thank you for your trust and support.

Best regards,
Hassan Abdelrahman

Dear Loan Department,

My name is Marek Novak, and I am writing to request a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new radio/television. For 9 years, I have worked as a maintenance supervisor at a local manufacturing plant in Stuttgart, and I have lived at my current residence for four years, where I own the property.

At present, my checking account is slightly negative because I covered urgent dental treatment for my dependent nephew. I have two other credits with your bank that I manage reliably, and my employment is stable. As a foreign worker, having access to diverse media is very important to me. I do not have a savings account, but I am a homeowner and have no other debts or installment plans outside the ones with your bank.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that I will be able to meet the repayment terms on time.

Kind regards,
Marek Novak

I do not have a savings account at present, but I possess real estate and remain steadily employed.

As a trustworthy customer with a consistent payment history, I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a positive response.

To the Loans Team,

My name is Andrei Popescu. I am a 67-year-old foreign worker who has been employed as a laboratory technician at Heidelberg University Hospital for the past seven years. I own my house, where I have lived for four years, and I support my adult son as my dependent.

I am applying for a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a radio and television, as my old devices recently stopped working. My bank account is currently negative due to unexpected medical bills. Nonetheless, I have a proven track record with two credits from your bank, always paid on time. Although I have no savings, my real estate and stable employment make me a reliable candidate.

Thank you for your attention to my application. I assure you of my utmost commitment to the repayment plan.

Sincerely,
Andrei Popescu
