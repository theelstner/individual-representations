Letter 1

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Giorgio Dimitrov. I am a 67-year-old single male residing in Stuttgart for the past four years, where I own my own home. I am writing to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,169 DM to purchase a modern radio and television set, which will help me stay connected with current events and in touch with my son, who lives abroad.

I have been employed as an office administrator at Siemens AG for the past nine years. My financial situation has recently become strained due to several necessary expenses, and my checking account is temporarily in overdraft. While I currently have two other credits with your bank, I have maintained a regular payment schedule for both, and my real estate property provides security.

I am a responsible person and have always taken my financial obligations seriously. With my stable employment and the value of my property, I believe I represent a low risk. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,
Giorgio Dimitrov

Dear Loan Officer,

My name is Faruk Isik, a retired railway operations specialist. I have lived in Düsseldorf for four years, where I own a small apartment. I am single and support my adult daughter while also working part-time for Deutsche Bahn, where I have been employed for eight years overall.

I am seeking a loan of 1,169 DM to buy a new television and radio, as my current devices are outdated and malfunctioning. This purchase will allow me to continue enjoying broadcasts from my home country and stay in contact with my granddaughter overseas. My checking account is currently overdrawn due to unexpected dental expenses, but I have consistently met installment payments for my two existing credits with your bank.

Although my credit history elsewhere is mixed, my long-standing employment record and stable living situation make me a reliable candidate. I kindly ask you to consider my application favorably.

Respectfully,
Faruk Isik

Dear Bank Manager,

I am Ivan Petrovic, a foreign national and real estate owner living in Frankfurt. For the last ten years, I have worked as a technical support officer at BASF. I am single and live with my 20-year-old son, whom I support through university. I have been at my current residence for four years.

I request a loan of 1,169 DM to purchase a new TV and radio set. My financial situation has been affected recently due to educational costs for my son, which temporarily put my account into overdraft. Despite this, I have always honored my commitments, as shown by my timely payments on two previous credits from your bank.

With my stable job, home ownership, and history of paying debts on schedule, I am confident you will find me a trustworthy applicant. Thank you for considering my request.

Yours sincerely,
Ivan Petrovic

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Samuel Mensah, and I am a senior electrical technician, having served with Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg for the past eight years. I am a 67-year-old widower, currently living with and supporting my grandson. I have resided at my current address, which I own, for four years.

I wish to apply for a loan of 1,169 DM to replace my old radio and television, which are essential for both my daily life and for maintaining contact with friends and relatives abroad. My financial status has been negatively impacted owing to increased medical costs, thus my checking account has currently fallen under zero. Though my record shows loans elsewhere, I have never missed a payment with your bank.

Given my steady employment, home ownership, and established relationship with your bank, I assure you of my reliability in repaying this loan. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Samuel Mensah

Dear Lending Department,

My name is Abdul Rahman Latif. I am a Turkish citizen who has lived and worked in Cologne, Germany, for over seven years, currently as a customs officer. I own my home, where I have lived with my nephew for four years. Although I am single, I am responsible for my nephew’s education and well-being.

I am applying for a loan of 1,169 DM for the purchase of a new radio and television. My checking account has recently dipped below zero due to urgent family expenses. However, I have always managed my existing credits at your bank without defaults, and I have no other loans elsewhere that would impact this repayment.

With my secure job, property ownership, and consistent payment record, I present low risk. I appreciate your consideration of my application and thank you for your time.

Kind regards,
Abdul Rahman Latif
